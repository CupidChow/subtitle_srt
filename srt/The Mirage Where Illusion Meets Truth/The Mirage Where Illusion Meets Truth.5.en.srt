1
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,940
Over there.

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,480
Slow down.

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,560
Aim at that.

4
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,320
Miss, are you scared?

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,760
We didn't mean to.

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
But you two seem to have quite a connection.

7
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,720
Nanny, over here.

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,250
Young master, take it easy.

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,340
Here you go.

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,040
Thank you.

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,320
Miss,

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,440
are you alone?

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,480
I came here with my father.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
He said he had something to do

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,400
and needed to step away.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,960
So what do you do for a living?

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,120
You're hunters from the mountains, aren't you?

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,050
How did you know?

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,860
You have animal pelts in your bamboo basket.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,600
How do you know we didn't buy them?

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,680
There are some scraps in your basket.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,280
Nobody buys those,

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,410
but sellers wouldn't throw them away.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,520
Want to try?

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,520
Here you go.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,920
Look.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,930
Keep your arm straight.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,140
Relax your shoulders.

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,560
Relax.

30
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,840
Ready?

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,759
Shoot.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,320
Hurry.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,640
Run!

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,850
Hold this for me.

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,720
Smell it.

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,780
Isn't it fragrant?

37
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,540
It'll be ready to eat soon.

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,079
Qin, use this to wash.

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,240
What's this?

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,480
Soapberry powder.

41
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,540
It removes grease.

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,200
This is quite expensive.

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,120
We usually just use wood ash.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Give it a try.

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,880
Okay.

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,280
This works really well.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,520
I secretly took it from my mother.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,180
I'll bring you more in 10 days.

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,040
In 10 days.

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
How did you know?

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
We've played together for so long.

52
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,079
I noticed that every 10 days,

53
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,920
you come with oil on your hands.

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,010
What kind of oil is this anyway?

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,160
It's tree sap.

56
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,240
My family collects it.

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,640
We make a groove in the tree,

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,040
then place a bowl underneath,

59
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,600
and the sap slowly drips into the bowl.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,520
What do you collect the sap for?

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
To water flowers.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,640
You water flowers with tree sap?

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,600
What kind of flowers?

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
My father says

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,880
only our family can know about it.

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,680
Why do you go there every 10 days?

67
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,640
After 10 days, the bowl is full.

68
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,440
I need to pour the sap onto the flowers.

69
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,440
So the tree and flowers must be close to each other?

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,200
Why don't you make a groove in a bamboo stick

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,840
so the sap flows directly to the flowers?

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,440
My father says

73
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,040
we must fill a complete bowl

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,900
before pouring it on the flowers.

75
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,200
Take me there to see it.

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,660
I'll make you a mechanism.

77
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,520
So it can pour itself when the bowl is full.

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,600
Then you won't need to go there so often.

79
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,320
It'll save you a lot of trouble.

80
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,280
No way.

81
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,800
My father doesn't allow me to bring others there.

82
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,159
Then how about this?

83
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,760
I'll teach you how to make it.

84
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,960
Awesome!

85
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,240
If it rains,

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,040
we can add a bamboo curtain on top to block the rain.

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
Chong, you're amazing!

88
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,600
Thanks so much for your help today.

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,520
I'll bring you meat rolls tomorrow.

90
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,120
Great! See you then.

91
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,000
Young Master.

92
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,560
You've been sitting here all night.

93
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,880
It's almost dawn.

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,610
Why don't you get some rest?

95
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,120
I'm not the only one

96
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,480
who can't sleep tonight.

97
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,520
That's great, sis!

98
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,880
Now I'll never get lost again.

99
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
And you'll always be able to find me.

100
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,480
Everyone has returned now.

101
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,410
But Zeng Xin is nowhere to be found.

102
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,210
Zeng Qian must be worried sick.

103
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,740
But now the mirage has completely disappeared.

104
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
It's not in the sky.

105
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,440
Not in Mirror Lake either.

106
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Even if we want to search, we don't know where to start.

107
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,980
What's wrong with you now?

108
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,360
That one-eyed little beggar of yours may have run away,

109
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,040
but at least he came back.

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
He shouldn't be hard to find.

111
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,260
What are you so worried about?

112
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,490
What am I worried about?

113
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,640
All the missing people have returned.

114
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,400
Yes.

115
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,000
But he doesn't remember anything.

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Even if I find that one-eyed beggar,

117
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,060
would he remember what happened that night?

118
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,050
Could he still prove my innocence?

119
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,760
Can this amnesia be cured?

120
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,200
I've heard of people with this condition before.

121
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
Apparently after experiencing some kind of trigger,

122
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,120
they suddenly remember what happened before.

123
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,250
I studied medicine.

124
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,040
About this condition,

125
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,300
I know more than you do.

126
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,700
That's not what I'm afraid of.

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,080
What I fear is

128
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
these people aren't sick at all.

129
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,130
They've been put under a spell.

130
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,500
Think about it.

131
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,400
This armored creature captured them first,

132
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,560
so why would it release them afterward?

133
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,520
Why?

134
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,560
They must have learned some secret,

135
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,970
and then this armored creature put a curse on them

136
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,050
to make them forget what happened,

137
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,680
fearing they might reveal it.

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,540
That still doesn't explain why they were released.

139
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,300
There are too many unexplained things here.

140
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,280
Who is this armored person?

141
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,720
Why capture these people?

142
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
Where did that city disappear to?

143
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,200
Where is Zeng Xin?

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,640
Why is he the exception?

145
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,200
Among all of us,

146
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,920
only Liu Guanying is fortunate.

147
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,180
He's the only one who found his daughter.

148
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,680
He's a Night Demon.

149
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
Why would Zeng Qian think that?

150
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,560
He's such an ordinary, simple person.

151
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,720
Just a bread seller.

152
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
How could he be a Night Demon?

153
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,280
Tongtong.

154
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Do you remember what I just told you?

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Tell me again.

156
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,280
My name is Liu Tong.

157
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
You're my father.

158
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,900
Your name is Liu Guanying.

159
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,400
Grandma has poor eyesight.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,880
Everyone calls her Aunt Ji.

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,560
Good.

162
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,800
That's enough for now.

163
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,240
We'll talk about the rest later.

164
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,840
The most important thing now

165
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,400
is not to worry Grandma.

166
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,300
How did you get that scar on your face?

167
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
I served in the military before.

168
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,520
During the war,

169
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,040
I was injured in a fire attack

170
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,770
and ended up looking like this.

171
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,400
Is that Tongtong coming back?

172
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,000
Mother.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,080
Why are you awake?

174
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,840
Without Tongtong here,

175
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,100
I couldn't sleep well.

176
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,840
Tongtong!

177
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,040
You're finally back.

178
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,760
Your father said you were staying at a new friend's place.

179
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,800
I was so worried about you.

180
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,240
Without you here, Grandma,

181
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,840
I couldn't sleep well either,

182
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
so I came back.

183
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,880
You're such a sweet talker.

184
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Grandma's love for you isn't wasted.

185
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,560
- Let's go.

186
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,020
- Back to the room quickly.

187
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,120
Didn't you say you couldn't remember anything?

188
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,760
But I remember what you told me.

189
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,890
Don't make your mother-in-law worry.

190
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,210
Where are you going?

191
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,520
Those people in black prevented us from digging the tunnel.

192
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
They must be connected to that city.

193
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,360
Even related to the disappearances.

194
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,560
Maybe if we find them,

195
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,600
we can discover Axin's whereabouts.

196
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,640
Those people in black appear and disappear like ghosts.

197
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,280
How are we supposed to find them?

198
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,010
Jinghu Lake.

199
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,920
Zeng Qian.

200
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
We'll go with you.

201
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,040
They're long gone from there.

202
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,570
They've been there before.

203
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,900
Don't you think she's acting like

204
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,760
a dog?

205
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,460
She's in a bad mood.

206
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,820
Watch what you say.

207
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,520
Incense.

208
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,120
How does this rag smell like incense?

209
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,360
It's just like how we smell of cooking oil after making food.

210
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,480
I've been sniffing for ages and couldn't smell anything.

211
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,360
Zeng Qian.

212
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,480
Even if you're a hunter,

213
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,800
isn't that a bit exaggerated?

214
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,280
What kind of person would carry the scent of incense?

215
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,340
There are plenty of people who burn incense regularly.

216
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,280
Such everyday incense scent dissipates quickly.

217
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,610
Even the keenest nose couldn't detect it.

218
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,600
But the place where this person stays

219
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,400
must have constant, abundant burning of incense.

220
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,780
Taoist temple.

221
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Buddhist temple.

222
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,440
Dengzhou has two Buddhist temples and one Taoist temple.

223
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Just three places.

224
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,280
That makes our search much easier.

225
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,920
I think we only need to check one place.

226
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,880
Wuji Temple.

227
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,240
This place was closed recently,

228
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,080
supposedly for internal renovations.

229
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,680
They're not letting anyone in.

230
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
I thought it was strange at the time.

231
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,650
Now that I think about it...

232
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,780
We don't know what's going on inside.

233
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,920
If we force our way in,

234
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
we might alert them to our presence.

235
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,040
Could we get in by pretending to be worshippers?

236
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,800
If the men in black are really in the Taoist temple,

237
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,480
and we go there rashly to investigate,

238
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,080
we could easily be recognized.

239
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,810
Who cares if we're recognized?

240
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,280
With Young Master Xie's influence in Dengzhou,

241
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,400
we could have officers escort us in,

242
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
and those men in black wouldn't dare touch us.

243
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,280
Well, thank you

244
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,840
for thinking so highly of me.

245
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,720
Let me tell you something.

246
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,640
This Taoist temple has powerful connections.

247
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,480
Master Zhang inside is the prefect's cousin.

248
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,640
Never mind about me.

249
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,000
Even my father has no influence there.

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,320
If we go, we'll be recognized.

251
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,960
Then we can find someone they haven't seen before.

252
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
Well, if you put it that way,

253
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,640
this becomes much simpler.

254
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,000
What's with those faces?

255
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,240
It's too soon.

256
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Put those expressions away

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,800
for now. You'll need them later.

258
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,640
Come in.

259
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,640
Alright, stop looking.

260
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,760
You can show those expressions now.

261
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,360
No need to hold back anymore.

262
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,570
You can even change your voice.

263
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,320
Boss.

264
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,000
Why don't we just ask that knife guy to come directly?

265
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,319
Young Master Xie

266
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,400
probably wants to show off in front of us.

267
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,940
Taoist Master,

268
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,240
what brings you here?

269
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,079
Last year I made a wish at your temple for a son,

270
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,480
and a few days ago my wife indeed gave birth to a boy.

271
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,610
Today I've come to fulfill my promise.

272
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,760
That's very thoughtful of you.

273
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
However, our temple is under renovation these days

274
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,320
and we cannot receive visitors.

275
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,240
Please don't worry, Master.

276
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,040
I'll just go in to light some incense and leave.

277
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,720
Besides,

278
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,160
I've come here

279
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,800
with sincere intentions.

280
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,080
It truly is inconvenient these days.

281
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,210
Please understand.

282
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,360
Master,

283
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,800
I've already come all this way.

284
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,200
If I go back without fulfilling my vow, I'll be scolded.

285
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,720
Sir,

286
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,620
please don't put me in a difficult position.

287
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,960
Aren't you the one making things difficult for me?

288
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,800
I just want to go in and light some incense.

289
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,360
How could that possibly disturb you?

290
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,320
I'm going in.

291
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,920
I just want to go in and light some incense.

292
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,250
I need to offer incense.

293
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,850
Did you all see that?

294
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,330
This Taoist temple definitely has something suspicious going on.

295
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,360
This wall looks easy to climb over.

296
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
Why don't we sneak in tonight and take a look?

297
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Those men in black aren't ordinary people.

298
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,800
There are only about a dozen of them.

299
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Such a large temple.

300
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
How can they guard it all?

301
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,480
The dozen we saw might not be all of them.

302
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,610
This is the spot.

303
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,370
The wind direction is perfect.

304
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,760
We randomly selected the location to release the sky lantern.

305
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,890
But they responded so quickly inside.

306
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,520
This means there are guards stationed inside all four walls of the Taoist temple.

307
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,850
This temple is so large,

308
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,920
divided into inner and outer courtyards.

309
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,600
There must be at least a hundred guards,

310
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,930
plus those on rotation,

311
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,280
making it at least 300 to 400 people.

312
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,520
That's incredible.

313
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,480
Who are they exactly?

314
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,120
Bandits?

315
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,180
Officials?

316
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,600
Military?

317
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,810
My brother must be in there.

318
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,960
How do you know?

319
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,300
Just a feeling.

320
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,440
Assuming Zeng Xin is really in the temple,

321
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,040
with the current level of security,

322
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,520
even if we manage to get in,

323
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,800
it would be difficult to safely bring him out.

324
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,160
I know you're anxious,

325
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,890
but the more anxious you are, the more likely you'll make mistakes.

326
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,180
We will definitely enter the temple.

327
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
I already have a plan.

328
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,840
Ma'am,

329
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,920
let me help you.

330
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,140
Go help your father serve the dishes.

331
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,860
Why do you always appear and disappear like a ghost?

332
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,240
Here, take this.

333
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,720
Number 18, Tazhong Hutong.

334
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,780
The commander of Qianji Guard's Han Division is there.

335
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,880
No need to open it.

336
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,810
It contains the same information.

337
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
If you already knew what to tell me,

338
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
why bother writing it down?

339
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,240
You must love what you do.

340
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,880
That's what being professional means.

341
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,320
Brother Bao, when you come to see me at night,

342
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,720
you can just knock and come in.

343
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,160
You don't have to meow like a cat.

344
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,560
Be professional.

345
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,880
Oh, right.

346
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,060
Don't forget to burn the note.

347
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,320
Okay.

348
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,960
If you don't come in soon,

349
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,220
the wine will get cold.

350
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,080
Finally no longer a Night Demon.

351
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,840
That beggar friend of yours

352
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,880
has first-class tracking skills.

353
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,300
But you didn't seem to tell him

354
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,170
that I used to be a Tabai.

355
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,040
You have no backup today.

356
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,080
And you won't have any in the future either.

357
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,810
You'll have plenty of chances.

358
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,360
But right now I have something important to do.

359
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,020
I don't have time to deal with you.

360
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,120
I hope you won't bother me anytime soon.

361
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,920
Don't worry.

362
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,480
After today,

363
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
I won't need to look for you anymore.

364
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,570
But your death alone isn't enough.

365
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,320
I know someone is behind you.

366
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,610
You were following someone's orders.

367
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,920
I want the truth.

368
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,000
The truth?

369
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,600
I happen to know the truth about something.

370
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,480
What if someone told Mrs. Ji

371
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,880
that her son died 4 years ago?

372
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,560
How many years has it been since anyone called you by your real name,

373
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,600
Feng Buhai?

374
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
If you insist on killing me today,

375
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,240
then someone will tell this secret to Mrs. Ji.

376
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
After I finish my own business,

377
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,760
I'll give you an explanation for Liu Guanying's death.

378
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,000
The wine is cold,

379
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,660
but it's still drinkable.

380
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,440
Since it's cold,

381
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,220
drink it yourself.

382
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,760
Tongtong,

383
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
come out here.

384
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,960
Mother-in-law isn't here.

385
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,240
I have something to tell you.

386
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,720
I thought you had already told me

387
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,080
almost everything from the past.

388
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,410
There's one more thing,

389
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,810
very important.

390
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,000
So you're not my father.

391
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,120
Your father was on a mission

392
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,920
when he was attacked by enemies.

393
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,600
With his last breath,

394
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,460
he asked me to take care of you and your grandmother.

395
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,440
I promised him.

396
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,800
Because your father wasn't just my comrade,

397
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
he was also the man who saved my life.

398
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,720
But when I actually arrived in Dengzhou,

399
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,760
I realized

400
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,060
I simply couldn't bring this tragic news

401
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,680
to an innocent child

402
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,360
and a poor old lady.

403
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,760
So...

404
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,000
To spare grandmother and me from grief,

405
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,000
you simply appeared as my father.

406
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,320
Your father and I were like brothers,

407
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,100
I knew everything about his life, big and small.

408
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,160
And...

409
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,690
When your father left home, you were too young

410
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,320
to remember what he looked like.

411
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
And grandmother has poor eyesight.

412
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
Originally, I only needed to disguise my voice

413
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,600
to get away with it.

414
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,480
But the neighbors all knew your father.

415
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,440
So I disguised myself as someone with a disfigured face,

416
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,560
covering my face with a thin veil daily

417
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,360
to prevent others from seeing my true appearance.

418
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,520
You could have kept this secret forever.

419
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,760
So why did you tell me?

420
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,400
Because you already knew.

421
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,840
Although I tried my best to hide my true face from you,

422
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,850
you're very clever.

423
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,560
In less than six months,

424
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,160
you saw through my disguise.

425
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,360
It started with little things,

426
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,960
you became suspicious of me.

427
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,640
For example,

428
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,800
I didn't know you disliked candied haws,

429
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,560
I didn't know you were afraid of rabbits,

430
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,240
I didn't know you were a decent swimmer, and so on.

431
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,200
But these were manageable,

432
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,960
I found reasonable explanations for everything.

433
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,160
Until one day,

434
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,200
you found a condolence letter in my room

435
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,880
about your father.

436
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
This letter came directly from the Ministry of War.

437
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,960
Under normal circumstances,

438
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,760
ordinary soldiers would never receive such treatment.

439
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,360
But your father was a Tabai soldier,

440
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,760
and had achieved merits.

441
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,420
So the Ministry not only provided compensation

442
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,450
but also sent a condolence letter about your father.

443
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,280
I knew about this beforehand,

444
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,970
to keep you and grandmother from learning the truth,

445
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,620
I intercepted the letter.

446
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,440
I thought that when you grew up,

447
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,610
I would explain everything to you.

448
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,240
That's why I didn't destroy the letter.

449
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
But you found out anyway.

450
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,920
So my pretending to be your father

451
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,520
couldn't be hidden anymore.

452
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,440
But...

453
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,570
I didn't tell grandmother,

454
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,920
did I?

455
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,370
That's why I say you're clever.

456
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,690
You kept questioning me back then.

457
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,360
After I told you the truth,

458
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,680
you cried your heart out.

459
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,900
You didn't speak to me for three days.

460
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,200
And then you decided

461
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,730
to help me keep this secret from grandmother.

462
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,840
All these years we've spent together

463
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,970
rather than being father and daughter

464
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,330
we're actually more like friends.

465
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,220
Good thing I'm still growing.

466
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,560
Let me ask you something.

467
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,280
Can I beat up those kids?

468
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,040
I'm telling you all this today

469
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,440
because I'm afraid

470
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,640
if you discover this again

471
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,640
you might lose control

472
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
and let grandmother know the truth.

473
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,960
Sister, look.

474
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,020
These are your favorite flowers.

475
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,560
Sister.

476
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,440
Why don't you take the bed?

477
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,370
I'll sleep on the floor.

478
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,320
Sister.

479
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,760
You must be tired.

480
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,040
I'll get you some hot water

481
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
to wash your face.

482
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,080
Young Master, are you up?

483
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,800
I'll bring you some porridge.

484
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,520
Okay.

485
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,520
You are

486
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,780
from Qianji Guard.

487
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,220
I remember you.

488
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,420
I'm looking for Cao Sheng.

489
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,740
Then wait a moment.

490
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,720
Didn't I tell you to wait?

491
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,520
I told you to wait.

492
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,570
Commander Lin asked me to give this to you.

493
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,840
What's in the box?

494
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,960
I don't know.

495
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,360
But she said I must deliver it to you personally.

496
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,440
Where is she now?

497
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,240
The item has been delivered.

498
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Farewell.

499
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,120
Waiter!

500
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,980
Check, please!

501
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,120
Sir?

502
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,600
Sir,

503
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,200
our noodles cost 10 wen,

504
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,480
you're still short 2 wen.

505
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,720
Last time I ate noodles here,

506
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,120
there were two eggs in it,

507
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,760
but today there's only one.

508
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,680
That's impossible.

509
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,400
We always use just one egg.

510
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,440
Then last time it was a double-yolk egg.

511
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,880
Today's isn't.

512
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,640
Did you shortchange me an egg?

513
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
No, sir.

514
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,480
Double-yolk eggs are a matter of luck.

515
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,560
That's just how it works.

516
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,160
You're short one egg.

517
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,760
I'll give you two coins less.

518
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,360
Sir.

519
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,290
Then say no more.

520
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,480
Young Master.

521
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,280
Liu Guanying's water pouch,

522
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,160
the drawing on that pouch

523
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,960
is almost identical to this one.

524
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,720
Especially these mountains and that river.

525
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,060
So this is Sunset Valley by the Huo River.

526
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,140
This is my father's handwriting.

527
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,000
The 38th year of Jingyun reign,

528
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,800
which was four years ago.

529
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,300
Something significant happened that year.

530
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,890
The Battle of Wusuling.

531
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,200
That painting on Liu Guanying's kettle

532
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,460
has the words 'rebel camp' written on it.

533
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,720
I heard that

534
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,400
when the rebels were defeated,

535
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,280
their remnants fled to the Huo River area.

536
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Baili Yuan was ordered to pursue them,

537
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,840
but the rebels hid in the mountains.

538
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,560
Baili Yuan and his men searched for months without success.

539
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,960
It wasn't until the Prince of Jingnan came to help

540
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,840
that they finally located the rebels

541
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,040
and eliminated them.

542
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,120
Could these events be related to the mirage too?

543
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,480
How many more secrets does Liu Guanying have?

544
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,120
We know he's Ye Yao,

545
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,200
and that his real identity is Feng Buhai.

546
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,640
Liu Guanying was actually his deceased comrade.

547
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,760
Now it seems this Liu Guanying, or rather Feng Buhai,

548
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,320
is involved in far more than we know.

549
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,730
Right now I'm more concerned about my father's secrets.

550
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,720
Feng Buhai was once a scout in Baili Yuan's camp.

551
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,920
It's no surprise that he saw the mirage.

552
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,300
But my father drew the exact same mirage,

553
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
which means he was there too.

554
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,250
Was it coincidence,

555
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,540
or was it...

556
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,360
Are you in there, Master Cao?

557
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,040
Wait.

558
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,360
What are you waiting for so long?

559
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,780
What are you doing?

560
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,560
What's going on?

561
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,600
You two in the room

562
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,840
being all secretive.

563
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,920
You!

564
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,360
Don't you have any manners?

565
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,040
Did I invite you in?

566
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,159
You just pushed your way in.

567
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,320
In broad daylight,

568
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,929
a man and woman alone behind closed doors.

569
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,639
It wouldn't sound good if people found out.

570
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,170
This is Master Xie's place.

571
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,960
And he's not charging us rent.

572
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,020
Come in if you want.

573
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,360
See?

574
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,040
Now that's someone who knows how to talk.

575
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,000
That sounds so nice to hear.

576
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,440
I came to tell you

577
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,120
that the person you asked me to find

578
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
has been located.

579
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,639
Let's go then.

580
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,159
Go where?

581
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,320
Where are you planning to go?

582
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,360
Didn't you tell Zeng Qian you had a way to get into Wuji Temple?

583
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
Do you have a plan?

584
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,889
It's already in motion.

585
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,400
By the way, Yunniang.

586
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,280
Did you take the porridge to Zeng Qian?

587
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,540
Did you both have some?

588
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,970
You need to eat something too, Cao.

589
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,620
Come in.

590
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,740
Have something to eat.

591
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,960
Why are you alone?

592
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,440
The young master went out with Xie Jingtang.

593
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
This is Chen Qi's home.

594
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,000
He should be back soon.

595
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,480
Why are you looking for a night soil collector?

596
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,000
Does it have something to do with the plan to infiltrate Wuji Temple?

597
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,960
I've been quite curious.

598
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,960
Aren't you the criminal Zeng Qian captured?

599
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,620
Why are you so eager to help her find her brother?

600
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Perhaps it's my chivalrous nature.

601
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,440
You've got some nerve.

602
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,840
Wait a minute.

603
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
I should be looking for that one-eyed little beggar.

604
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,560
Why am I getting involved in your business?

605
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,080
Perhaps it's because you're not only chivalrous, Master Xie,

606
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,410
but also kind-hearted.

607
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,760
Seems you understand my personal qualities

608
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,840
quite thoroughly.

609
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,560
Alright.

610
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,680
No more joking around.

611
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,200
I really need to attend to my own business now.

612
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,640
This chivalrous act

613
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,360
ends here.

614
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,480
Don't worry, Master Xie.

615
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,880
We won't let you be chivalrous to us forever.

616
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,010
When the time comes,

617
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,060
we'll come to your aid as well.

618
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,160
You help us find Zeng Xin,

619
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,140
I'll help you find the little beggar.

620
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,800
And help me steal something.

621
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,720
No,

622
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,720
someone stole something from me.

623
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,780
Help me get it back.

624
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,640
I can do that.

625
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,040
And help me kill someone.

626
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,800
That depends on who it is.

627
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
The person who stole from me.

628
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,600
What did they steal from you?

629
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,000
Is it worth killing over?

630
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,320
He took my...

631
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,080
Chen Qi is back.

632
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,280
This night soil collector job

633
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
isn't something just anyone can do.

634
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,280
That smell on him

635
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,080
I can smell it from this far away.

636
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,640
When you disguise yourself as someone else,

637
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,840
how do you deal with height differences?

638
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,160
If I want to be taller,

639
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,840
I put something in my shoes.

640
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,540
If I want to be shorter,

641
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,720
I just hunch over.

642
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,360
A difference of three inches isn't a big deal.

643
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,490
But if it's too much,

644
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,660
there's no way.

645
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,080
So you've gotten a good look at Chen Qi now, right?

646
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,000
Yes, I have.

647
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,960
I'm excellent at remembering faces.

648
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,160
Once I've seen someone, I never forget.

649
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,120
However,

650
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,960
what are you suggesting?

651
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,880
No way, brother.

652
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,160
No, no.

653
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,320
This thing,

654
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,940
I absolutely cannot do it.

655
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,640
Have some confidence.

656
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,370
You can do it.

657
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,760
Didn't you say you could become anyone?

658
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,080
I just can't become that night soil collector.

659
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,880
I can't get on that waste cart.

660
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,170
I'm afraid before I even get on,

661
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,600
I'll vomit until there's nothing left.

662
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Sesame oil on your nose,

663
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,640
ginger in your mouth,

664
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,770
can remove the odor.

665
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,240
You're treating me like a coroner.

666
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,960
Think about it.

667
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,620
We're helping each other now.

668
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,480
Can I just not have your help?

669
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,480
I have plenty of people.

670
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,560
Plenty of people to help me.

671
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,360
Is that so?

672
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,160
Then why haven't you been able to find that little beggar?

673
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,640
This has nothing to do with money.

674
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Sometimes having more people doesn't help.

675
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,500
You need to find the right person.

676
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,760
You're here.

677
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,490
I was just about to look for you.

678
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,840
What are you really up to?

679
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,120
The most important thing now

680
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,920
is to confirm whether Zeng Xin is actually in the temple.

681
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,580
Forcing our way in won't work.

682
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
We need to be clever about it.

683
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,480
The entire temple is now heavily guarded.

684
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,720
It's no exaggeration to call it an impenetrable fortress.

685
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,520
But it can't be isolated from the world.

686
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,780
Where there are people, there are needs.

687
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,300
Where there are needs,

688
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,610
there will be supplies.

689
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,040
With so many people living inside,

690
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,920
they must need food, right?

691
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,960
So they'll definitely need to purchase supplies.

692
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,020
When that happens,

693
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,280
we'll hide near the Taoist temple

694
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,920
and knock them out secretly.

695
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,960
Let's have Xie Jingtang

696
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,640
disguise himself as one of them and sneak in.

697
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,770
Wouldn't that work?

698
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,520
First of all,

699
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,160
we don't know what they're up to in there.

700
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,760
Judging from the closure of the temple,

701
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,920
they must have planned this in advance.

702
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,600
And for things like food supplies,

703
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,530
they can prepare them beforehand.

704
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,840
They can arrange specific vendors to deliver at scheduled times.

705
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,800
Their people don't even need to come out.

706
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,480
They just need to collect the deliveries at the door.

707
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,680
I had thought about using knockout drugs before,

708
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,880
but if they're even slightly cautious,

709
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,280
they'll definitely inspect all food supplies carefully.

710
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,000
So drugging won't work either.

711
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,730
But then I realized something.

712
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Their people can stay inside the Taoist temple indefinitely.

713
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,960
But some things can't stay inside.

714
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,020
First, food waste.

715
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
Second, human waste.

716
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Food waste is easy to handle.

717
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,240
It can be fed to horses.

718
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,960
But human waste...

719
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,240
So you thought about the night soil collectors, didn't you?

720
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,400
The waste carriers.

721
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,720
Ordinary households only need night soil collectors every 8 to 10 days.

722
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,360
Wealthy families every 3 to 5 days.

723
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,640
But with hundreds of people in the temple,

724
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,080
they'd need collection at least once a day.

725
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,480
Even if I could disguise myself as that night soil collector...

726
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,410
Even if I could overcome the smell,

727
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,200
what if I'm discovered once inside the Taoist temple?

728
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,760
That sky lantern there,

729
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,440
that would be my fate.

730
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,480
You'll be in disguise.

731
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,760
How would anyone recognize you?

732
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,600
I'm using disguise techniques,

733
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,130
not transformation magic.

734
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,520
People who know me well could easily see through it.

735
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,080
Sewage workers wear face coverings

736
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,400
to block the smell, covering half their face.

737
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,460
You shouldn't be easily recognized.

738
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,600
I'll go.

739
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,040
This is my own business.

740
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,840
There's no need for others to risk themselves for me.

741
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,560
Master Xie,

742
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,920
please disguise me as a sewage worker.

743
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,840
Is there any problem?

744
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,440
This isn't difficult at all.

745
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,080
Actually, I've thought about this before,

746
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,340
but there's one issue we need to resolve.

747
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,520
The sound.

748
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,680
Can you teach me this?

749
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,080
Do you know how long it took me

750
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,520
to learn this?

751
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,680
A whole year.

752
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,440
Even if you're 10 times smarter than me,

753
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
it would still take at least a month.

754
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,720
If you put it that way,

755
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,320
she might learn it in no time.

756
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,380
Let Zeng Qian give it a try.

757
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,640
You're the best candidate to enter the Taoist temple.

758
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,640
And your height is similar to Chen Qi,

759
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,570
differing by no more than 3 inches.

760
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,200
So when you went to find Chen Qi,

761
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,000
you were considering both of us.

762
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,440
If we can successfully enter the temple

763
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,480
and find Axin,

764
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,200
how do we rescue him?

765
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,360
This is the most crucial step.
