1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,200
What did you say before we came here?

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,800
Didn't you say that city fell into this lake

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,000
and the water dried up?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,440
Now we can see the lake is indeed drying up,

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,640
but where is the city?

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,010
It's right there in the sky.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,960
Did that city never actually fall down?

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,720
Were you seeing things,

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,680
or did your brain suddenly malfunction?

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,280
How dare you speak to my young master like that?

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,200
Then tell me.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,880
Where did all the water from this lake go?

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,960
It went into your head.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,560
This lake is quite strange.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,080
Look inside.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,200
Such a huge crater.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,160
It looks like something pressed down on it.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,840
So that means...

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,720
This city really did descend here before.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,760
The massive crater at the bottom of the lake was created by its weight.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,400
It's not here anymore

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,360
because

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,760
it flew back up to the sky.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,320
So you're saying

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,240
the mirage in the sky

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,519
is actually a real city

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,800
that can move and fly?

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,960
Well, if that's the case,

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,760
then the armored creatures being there

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,920
and all those missing people being there too

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,680
wouldn't be surprising at all.

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,360
Do you think this city will come down again?

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,039
If it stays up there forever,

34
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,300
what are we going to do?

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,370
Let's go back first.

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,850
We'll figure something out later.

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,020
What are you doing?

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,080
Do you know who I am?

39
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,880
People from Dengzhou have gone missing.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,479
We suspect mountain bandits are responsible.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,880
I've never seen you people before.

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,000
Your behavior is suspicious.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,480
You're probably accomplices of the bandits.

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,960
Take them to the county office.

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,680
Lock them up.

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Wait a minute.

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
Strangers?

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
I think you're the strangers here.

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
You don't even recognize me.

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,200
You're the bandits, aren't you?

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,800
There's even a criminal tattoo on your face.

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,680
You must have stolen those official uniforms.

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,610
We're from the prefecture office.

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,760
It's normal that Young Master Xie doesn't recognize us.

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,620
If you don't believe me, go ask your father, Xie Kui.

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,720
Just you wait.

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,440
It really is from the prefecture office.

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,880
They even brought up my father.

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,760
They're clearly here to give us trouble.

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,000
The question is why.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,160
If we really want to pass, they can't stop us.

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,280
I'll take the first five.

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,320
You handle the rest.

65
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,440
We're listening.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,800
No, no, no.

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
It's not worth it.

68
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,720
There's no need to get on the wrong side of government officials, right?

69
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,440
Besides,

70
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,280
we were planning to return to Dengzhou anyway.

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,940
But I don't want to waste time.

72
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Nothing is more important than finding my brother right now.

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,520
Things aren't clear yet.

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,480
If we offend them rashly,

75
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,640
we might face bigger troubles later.

76
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,200
Right.

77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Don't worry.

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm here.

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,600
Going back with them will be fine.

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,960
You talk like you're so capable,

81
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
but when it matters,

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
you're completely useless.

83
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,120
It's different.

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,490
Others get caught and go to prison.

85
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,579
We're just going home.

86
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,040
I need to stay in Dengzhou for a few more days.

87
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,970
I have some personal matters to attend to.

88
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,370
Here's 2,000 taels.

89
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,560
Share it among the brothers.

90
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,200
Everyone can go their separate ways now.

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,560
The prisoner we were escorting died unnaturally.

92
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,280
The authorities will surely hold us accountable for negligence.

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,410
You're letting us go

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,420
because you want to take all the blame yourself.

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,840
Something like this,

96
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,360
not just me, Shen Hui,

97
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,920
but none of the brothers in the Han Unit would agree to.

98
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,000
We brothers have followed you for years

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,440
and never suffered any losses.

100
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,640
The Han Camp exists only because of you.

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,220
We're not going anywhere.

102
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,080
Wherever you are, that's where we'll be.

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,810
The rules of Qianji Guard state

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,930
those who disobey orders must die.

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,760
Do you want me to kill you?

106
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Go.

107
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,200
I'll distribute the money to our brothers

108
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,640
and let them leave. I'll stay.

109
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,680
If you don't agree,

110
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,800
kill me now.

111
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,460
Then let's do this.

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,840
I need you to do something for me.

113
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,840
Go to Qingzhou to get something.

114
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,780
Deliver it to someone.

115
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you for your hard journey.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,330
Thanks for your effort.

117
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,480
This way.

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,280
Everyone.

119
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Place all your weapons on the table.

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,000
Sir.

121
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,680
Please come this way.

122
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,620
I'll talk to you later, Zhang.

123
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,440
Keep a close eye on these people.

124
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't worry.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,530
I'll watch them carefully.

126
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Zhang.

127
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,040
What's the situation there?

128
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,920
Don't know which bastard did it.

129
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,080
They dug many tunnels under Dengzhou.

130
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Even connected to the prison.

131
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
Absolutely outrageous.

132
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,480
Alright.

133
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Everyone's gone.

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
Open the door.

135
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,160
Young Master.

136
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,120
We can't do that.

137
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,740
We need to wait for word from the prefecture.

138
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,040
You dug this tunnel, didn't you?

139
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Then your father...

140
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Indeed.

141
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,120
What's wrong with the prefecture now?

143
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,040
They can't just arrest people without reason.

144
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,920
Many people have been saying lately.

145
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,080
That the mirage from the sky fell into Mirror Lake.

146
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,440
The officials say they're spreading rumors.

147
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
And with so many people missing.

148
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,520
Everyone's in a panic.

149
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,159
So they've locked up everyone who's been to Mirror Lake.

150
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,560
The people next door are in the same situation as you.

151
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,159
I knew the mirage incident.

152
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,760
Couldn't be known only to us.

153
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,159
So you've silenced everyone.

154
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,400
Fine. There's no point talking to you.

155
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
I'll go find my father.

156
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Open the door now.

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,760
They already told you.

158
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,360
Even your father can't help.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Let me go out alone then.

160
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,640
Wait for me to come back.

161
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,840
I'll get you all out.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,530
Hurry up.

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,760
Come back soon.

164
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Young Master Xie.

165
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,920
Please bring back some wound medicine.

166
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,850
Wound medicine.

167
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Let me take a look.

168
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,640
No need.

169
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,760
I've studied medicine.

170
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,600
Trust me.

171
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,000
I know.

172
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,690
If you know, then why...

173
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,320
Did you all

174
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,400
hear some rumors about me?

175
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,880
Let's just say Young Master Xie is too famous in Dengzhou.

176
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,000
A murderer with two lives on his hands.

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,560
They must be talking about

178
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,090
when you killed someone with your treatment.

179
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,410
The patient I treated back then

180
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
was an alcoholic.

181
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,880
One of the herbs in my prescription was aconite.

182
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,740
That herb reacts badly with alcohol.

183
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,740
I specifically warned him not to drink any alcohol.

184
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,420
He agreed to follow my instructions.

185
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,840
But just a few days later,

186
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,640
he died.

187
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,820
His family demanded an explanation from me.

188
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,400
They claimed I killed him with my treatment.

189
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
I examined the body.

190
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,280
It was obvious

191
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,600
he had been drinking before his death.

192
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,640
Of course,

193
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,560
he died because the alcohol reacted with my medicine.

194
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,320
But his family refused to admit he had been drinking.

195
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,920
They just blamed me instead.

196
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,760
The incident grew bigger and rumors spread wider.

197
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,240
To appease public anger,

198
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,250
my father paid the family a large sum of money.

199
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,800
But that only confirmed people's belief that I killed the patient.

200
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,400
It's truly like jumping into the Yellow River -

201
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,680
impossible to clear my name.

202
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
You're right not to trust me.

203
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,560
If you don't treat this wound

204
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,840
you'll develop a fever tonight.

205
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,200
Wait for me.

206
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,080
When I was a child,

207
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,640
I drew lots

208
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,880
and got a Chinese herb called Yuanzhi.

209
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,960
As I grew up, I really wanted to become a great doctor

210
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,560
healing people everywhere.

211
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,240
But I was falsely accused of being incompetent,

212
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,560
so I gave up on that dream.

213
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,960
I think it's better

214
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,920
to just be a carefree person.

215
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,840
It's been a long time,

216
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,280
really long since anyone

217
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,940
has trusted me with medicine.

218
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
It's rare to have your trust.

219
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,440
Thank you.

220
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,880
Open the door!

221
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,880
You trusted him.

222
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,980
Indeed, it was rather abrupt.

223
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,680
Oh dear!

224
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,640
Why did you come out?

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,040
Didn't I tell you to stay inside?

226
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
Why are you arresting us?

227
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
They're officials sent from the prefecture.

228
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,200
With orders from the magistrate,

229
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,080
saying anyone who's been to Mirror Lake recently

230
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,520
will be detained.

231
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,840
But I don't think it's serious.

232
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,120
So just stay put in there.

233
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,880
There's food and drink inside.

234
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,520
I'll resolve this matter quickly.

235
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,120
Go.

236
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,000
Father,

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,480
I didn't do anything wrong!

238
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,160
Tell me,

239
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,360
which law in the Great Yin Dynasty forbids people from going to the lake?

240
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,090
Are you causing trouble again?

241
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,370
Get back to your cell right now.

242
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:51,920
Hurry.

243
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,440
Go.

244
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,360
Fine, I'll go back.

245
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,640
But when I go back, I'll release them all.

246
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,440
Release them?

247
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,680
If you release them,

248
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,440
you'll be the death of your father!

249
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,840
I...

250
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,240
Fine!

251
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,320
If you want my life,

252
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll give it to you right now.

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,280
Here we go again.

254
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,920
If I release them,

255
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,000
how am I supposed to explain it to the magistrate?

256
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,960
Fine.

257
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
Rather than waiting for the magistrate to punish me,

258
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,400
I might as well just die now.

259
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Drink!

260
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
You always pull this trick.

261
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,800
I don't believe that's really poison in your bottle.

262
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,640
I'll drink it!

263
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,600
Father, you win again.

264
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,240
You win.

265
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,520
Can I just go back now?

266
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,720
The cell is that way.

267
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,280
If father doesn't care about me, I'll care for myself.

268
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,010
I'm going back to get a blanket.

269
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
Young Master.

270
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,640
Young Master.

271
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,080
Why have you come back?

272
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,960
Didn't the master say you were locked up in jail?

273
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,200
I came back to get some things.

274
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
Young Master.

275
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,760
Young Master, you've just returned from jail.

276
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,080
It's not convenient for you to go in.

277
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,600
Let me bring you a fire stove to step over.

278
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,360
To ward off bad luck.

279
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,240
What's the point of stepping over it?

280
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,970
We still have to go back anyway.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,240
It's already afternoon.

282
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,570
Why are you still in bed?

283
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,320
I'm not feeling well.

284
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,720
I might be sick.

285
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,600
Just laid down.

286
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,400
You're sick?

287
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Let me take a look.

288
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,160
Even you don't trust my medical skills now.

289
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,760
No.

290
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,220
I just took some medicine.

291
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,320
You should get some rest.

292
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,720
I'll go get some bedding.

293
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,460
I'll get it for you.

294
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,360
Gu Tingmei.

295
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,520
You two!

296
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,280
Bastard!

297
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,570
Brother Xie.

298
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,400
Jingtang.

299
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:15,920
Jingtang.

300
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,250
Gu Tingmei, I've always treated you well.

301
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,920
Bastard!

302
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,160
You made me a cuckold!

303
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Don't go!

304
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,720
Jingtang.

305
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,680
Jingtang, stop hitting him!

306
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,760
Let go of me.

307
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,280
You bitch.

308
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,120
You damn bitch.

309
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
I'll kill you.

310
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,920
Go ahead.

311
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,200
Just do it.

312
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,400
It's not your first time killing someone anyway.

313
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't think I wouldn't dare.

314
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,480
Of course you would dare.

315
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,680
Who do you think you are?

316
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,920
You're Xie Jingtang,

317
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,840
the precious son of Dengzhou's magistrate.

318
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,040
Everyone gives way to you.

319
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,560
Everyone covers for you.

320
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,000
You think they're really afraid of you?

321
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,520
They're only afraid of your father's position.

322
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,380
You're already in your thirties.

323
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,650
What can you possibly accomplish?

324
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,280
Even beggars on the street are better than you.

325
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,960
One day when your father dies,

326
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,640
Shut up!

327
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,520
So many people are waiting to bleed you dry,

328
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,920
Shut up!

329
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
to skin you alive.

330
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,840
Young Madam.

331
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,060
Young Madam, are you alright?

332
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,880
Tang.

333
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,080
Why is there such a commotion?

334
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,120
I just saw-

335
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,720
This...

336
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,440
What happened here?

337
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,770
How did it get like this?

338
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,280
There was a rat.

339
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,160
A rat?

340
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,050
What kind of rat would cause this much damage?

341
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,720
This... this...

342
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,520
This is your wedding quilt!

343
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,120
How did it get torn?

344
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,770
If it's torn, it's torn.

345
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,690
I don't want it anymore.

346
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,720
No more.

347
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,040
Being able to kidnap so many people without a trace,

348
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,920
and make a city float in the air.

349
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
This armored stranger...

350
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,840
Could he be one of those legendary mystics?

351
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,280
Ancient books mentioned them, didn't they?

352
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,320
Some sorcerers skilled in magic could move mountains and seas,

353
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,200
even capture stars and the moon.

354
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Those soldiers are suspicious too.

355
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,400
Their timing was far too convenient.

356
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,960
Besides,

357
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,640
their reasons for detaining us were flimsy at best.

358
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,960
Could the government be involved in all this?

359
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,880
We can't openly confront those soldiers,

360
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,480
but can't we deal with them secretly?

361
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,800
Wouldn't that be provoking the authorities?

362
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,240
They provoked us first.

363
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,400
Going after those soldiers is pointless.

364
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,120
Three of them have tattoos on their faces.

365
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
They're all exiled criminals.

366
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,480
When I was in the army, I heard that

367
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,320
provincial offices sometimes recruit such people as auxiliary soldiers,

368
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,800
specifically for menial tasks.

369
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,520
Even if we force them to talk,

370
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,420
they won't have any useful information.

371
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,560
So you were a soldier?

372
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,680
Whether it's the armored man or the government,

373
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,599
they're all connected to the mirage.

374
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,560
If we want to solve these mysteries,

375
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,119
we need to find a way

376
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,650
to get into that city above.

377
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,330
There really is a medicine box.

378
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,120
It's so new.

379
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,840
Never been used.

380
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,170
Or just polished daily?

381
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,720
Young master?

382
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,180
Did I say something wrong?

383
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Need any help?

384
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,560
Just now,

385
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,360
did something happen?

386
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,480
It's nothing.

387
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,320
Thank you.

388
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
Can you help me kill someone?

389
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
I'm just a hunter.

390
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,810
The one I want to kill is a beast.

391
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,640
I'm just a vegetable bun seller.

392
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,080
What's wrong with him?

393
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,280
Didn't he say he'd take us out when he returned?

394
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,680
If we go out,

395
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,320
I do have a way.

396
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,200
To enter the mirage.

397
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,960
Are we just leaving like this?

398
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,160
It'll be hard for him to explain, right?

399
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,560
Let's go.

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,680
Zhang,

401
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,520
go back and tell my father

402
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,600
I will definitely find that little beggar who can prove my innocence.

403
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,400
This time,

404
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,860
I won't rely on him.

405
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,480
Boss.

406
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,960
I've had someone fix the window in your room.

407
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,220
That's not important.

408
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,160
Give each of my friends

409
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,360
a nice room to stay in.

410
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,890
Alright.

411
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,010
I don't need one.

412
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,400
Zeng Qian.

413
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
Cao Sheng will have to share a room with you.

414
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,360
After all, he's still your prisoner.

415
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,960
You need to keep an eye on him.

416
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,680
Forget it.

417
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,080
I can't watch him anyway.

418
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,410
This is a mirage.

419
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,720
I've made some calculations.

420
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,520
The distance from the mirage to the ground

421
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,580
is about 300 zhang.

422
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,040
Even with the longest-range crossbow,

423
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,370
we still can't reach it.

424
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,240
However, there's a mountain below the mirage.

425
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,440
Fengming Mountain.

426
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,120
Yes.

427
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,840
From the peak of Fengming Mountain to the mirage

428
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,080
is only about 100 zhang.

429
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,920
That ballista should reach far enough.

430
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,080
But where can we find such things?

431
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,880
I can make it.

432
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,480
However...

433
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,800
The better the crossbow,

434
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,440
the higher the requirements for the wood used for the body.

435
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,360
Jujube wood has the best elasticity.

436
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,400
And for a ballista,

437
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,640
we must use thick wood with red heartwood.

438
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,000
But near Dengzhou,

439
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,570
it's extremely difficult to find.

440
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,920
How about cannons?

441
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,600
The final battle between Dian and Dayin

442
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,160
took place near Dengzhou.

443
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,240
Although the war ended,

444
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,970
many weapons were left behind.

445
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,000
Though many were looted by civilians,

446
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,530
the Dengzhou county office

447
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,050
still managed to retrieve one cannon.

448
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
But this thing is over 100 years old now.

449
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I don't know if it still works.

450
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,920
If it works,

451
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,320
we can shoot an iron hook with rope

452
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,850
onto the walls of Shenjing.

453
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,560
Then climbing up won't be difficult.

454
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Then please,

455
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
Master Xie, get the cannon from the county office.

456
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,880
I told you I won't rely on my father.

457
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,930
It doesn't have to go through your father.

458
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,560
Alright then.

459
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,840
We'll see when the time comes.

460
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
If it's usable,

461
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
let's move it out.

462
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,680
I won't go.

463
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,480
I need to check on my mother.

464
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,600
You've served in the military.

465
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,360
You know more about artillery than we do.

466
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,320
You have to go.

467
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,600
Fine.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,280
We all have our own rooms.

469
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Take your luggage

470
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,740
and find your rooms first.

471
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,480
Yunniang,

472
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,080
Zeng Qian,

473
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
you two rest for a while.

474
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,170
The three of us can go by ourselves.

475
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,520
Chong'er,

476
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,920
what are you thinking about?

477
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,400
Father,

478
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,560
is that city you mentioned real?

479
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,090
Can it really fly in the sky?

480
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,800
Of course it's real.

481
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,200
Where is it?

482
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,920
Why do we need to go there?

483
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,320
Do I really have this much stuff?

484
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,880
Half of this is gunpowder.

485
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,010
Then you should put it down carefully.

486
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,640
By the way, young master.

487
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,960
That female ghostwriter Zeng Qian,

488
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,360
is she the same girl

489
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,200
you know,

490
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,360
the one you said

491
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,160
you met at Jiuyuan Mountain when you were little?

492
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,920
How did you know?

493
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,840
When I was fighting with her,

494
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,200
as soon as she drew that dagger,

495
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,000
you immediately told me to stop.

496
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,240
And then,

497
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,480
your attitude toward her changed completely.

498
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,340
You mentioned that girl also had a very special dagger.

499
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Could it really be such a coincidence?

500
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,290
When did I tell you all this?

501
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,840
And since when did you become so clever, Yunniang?

502
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
It depends on the situation.

503
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,480
Since you recognized her,

504
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,960
why didn't you reveal your identity to her?

505
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,000
Also,

506
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,600
you didn't tell her that Liu Guanying is Yeyan.

507
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,130
Her brother is missing.

508
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,560
Given her current state,

509
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm afraid saying too much would cause problems.

510
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,760
I'll tell her when the time is right.

511
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,360
By the way,

512
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,400
I asked Liu Guanying to go see the cannons with us

513
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
to get him out of the way,

514
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,050
so you could go to his house.

515
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,040
Don't you think

516
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,730
Liu Guanying knows quite a lot?

517
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,680
He knows so much!

518
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,890
That's not what I meant.

519
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,280
Remember by the lake,

520
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,960
Zeng Qian said the mirage might be an actual city?

521
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,320
So you're saying

522
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,000
the mirage in the sky

523
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,160
is actually a real city,

524
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,100
and it can move and fly.

525
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,100
His reaction was too calm,

526
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,880
so calm that I can't help but suspect

527
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,480
he knew about all this from the beginning.

528
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,280
Then why didn't he say anything?

529
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,570
I'm curious too.

530
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,640
He must have secrets.

531
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,080
Secrets even bigger than him being Yeyan.

532
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Let's investigate and find out.

533
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,880
I think your outfit is a bit too eye-catching.

534
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,080
Why don't you take off that conical hat?

535
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,120
If I take it off,

536
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,850
wouldn't I stand out even more?

537
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,440
That's true.

538
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,020
Then let's use the back door of the county office later.

539
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,280
Guanying is back.

540
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,600
My family is still busy at home right now.

541
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,200
So I think I'll skip the meal.

542
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,040
The host has already set up the table.

543
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,920
Besides, you've already given your gift.

544
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,720
If you don't go,

545
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
it would be quite rude to the host.

546
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,210
Yes, indeed.

547
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,320
Let's go.

548
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,120
Let's go.

549
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,680
Mrs. Ji!

550
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,040
All the neighbors arrived long ago.

551
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,440
Why are you still at home?

552
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,980
What's going on, Xiao Liu?

553
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,320
Don't you know?

554
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,720
Mrs. Wang's family is having a wedding today.

555
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,080
Your family already gave a gift.

556
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,520
Why are you still at home drying vegetables?

557
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,560
Come with me quickly.

558
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,960
I didn't give any gift.

559
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,880
It was your Guanying who gave it.

560
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,600
Look here,

561
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,000
his name is written on it.

562
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,000
Mrs. Ji,

563
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,300
where is Guanying?

564
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
He's not home.

565
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,760
Then you should go.

566
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,520
It's the same thing.

567
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Here, I'll help you with the drying.

568
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,810
Put it properly.

569
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,600
Alright.

570
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,120
Let's go, Mrs. Ji.

571
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,400
My cane.

572
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,730
Your cane is right here.

573
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,320
Slow down.

574
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,040
If we're any later,

575
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,300
the food will get cold.

576
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
What's the rush?

577
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,420
I still need to invite others after this.

578
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
This is the place.

579
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,240
It should still work,

580
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,500
but we need to clean the rust inside the barrel thoroughly.

581
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,680
That's easy.

582
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,440
We just need to get some white vinegar.

583
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Use lye water instead.

584
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,370
It works better.

585
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,680
Burn dry rice straw into ash,

586
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,040
then pour the ash onto a gauze and rinse with water.

587
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,970
This will filter out the lye water.

588
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,570
Don't you know this?

589
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,570
I don't know either.

590
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,800
You can even make a mounted crossbow,

591
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,080
how could you not know about lye water?

592
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,640
There's plenty I don't know.

593
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,500
That's why I'm learning from you.

594
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,880
All right, I'll go prepare the lye water.

595
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,600
You're good at martial arts and strong.

596
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,880
Help us move these cannons here.

597
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,560
I'll go prepare the filtered ash water.

598
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,520
I thought you didn't know how.

599
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,850
It's a good opportunity

600
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,920
to learn.

601
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,400
Listen,

602
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,440
can the three of us

603
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,520
move this big chunk of iron out first?

604
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,720
Let him go prepare the filtered ash water.

605
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,400
I have a way.

606
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
Where is Liu Guanying?

607
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,640
He said he went to figure something out.

608
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,840
Asked me to wait here.

609
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,180
He won't come back.

610
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,600
Why?

611
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,860
He agreed too quickly.

612
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,130
I should have known.

613
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
What are you talking about?

614
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,980
I don't understand a word.

615
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Guanying is back!

616
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,680
What's so urgent?

617
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,320
You're back just in time.

618
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,960
Just now,

619
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,020
I went to Mrs. Wang's place for a meal.

620
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
I barely ate anything

621
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,560
when everyone started taking food home.

622
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,760
I didn't have any wax paper

623
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,960
or lotus leaves,

624
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,680
so I just grabbed some wedding cakes.

625
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
And right as I came in, I met this young lady.

626
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
She says she's here looking for you.

627
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,360
Come, have a seat.

628
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,600
Try some wedding cake for good luck.

629
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,930
What are you doing here?

630
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,010
I'm looking for you.

631
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,720
What do you want with me?

632
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,000
I heard that your family's

633
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,440
vegetable buns are especially delicious.

634
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,640
So I came to try them.

635
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,400
You like vegetable buns?

636
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,520
Why didn't you say so earlier?

637
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,960
I'll go make some for you.

638
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,440
Great.

639
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,850
I'll go boil some water first, Mrs. Ji.

640
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,120
Guanying

641
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,040
Mom

642
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,400
I think this girl is quite nice.

643
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
When did you meet her?

644
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
Is she engaged to someone?

645
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,640
Mom, we're just friends.

646
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,280
Mrs. Ji

647
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,960
Feel this.

648
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,450
Is this good enough?

649
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,760
It's too soft.

650
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,440
We need to add more flour.

651
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
More?

652
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,760
Yes.

653
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,920
Knead it more.

654
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,080
That's how the dough becomes chewy.

655
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,880
Young Master.

656
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,440
Didn't you want to eat Aunt Ji's vegetable buns?

657
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,700
She's making them now.

658
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,360
Then please thank Aunt Ji for me.

659
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,690
You run pretty fast.

660
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,780
Weren't you filtering ash water?

661
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,500
Shouldn't you be moving cannons?

662
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,970
I heard there were rats at home.

663
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,280
So I came back.

664
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,730
Rats in broad daylight?

665
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,320
Maybe they're like you.

666
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,780
They probably enjoy our vegetable buns too.

667
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,680
Did it get any?

668
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,340
It ran away.

669
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,480
However,

670
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,580
next time might be different.

671
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,100
There's a mirage painted on his water pouch.

672
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,560
That water pouch of his looks quite old.

673
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,160
I wanted to take it.

674
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,620
But didn't get the chance.

675
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,440
It's probably for the best.

676
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,600
Otherwise we would have been exposed.

677
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,929
We're already exposed.

678
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,900
How did he find out?

679
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,489
That's impossible.

680
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,080
If his water pouch is that old,

681
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,480
it means mirages like the one in Dengzhou

682
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,340
have appeared somewhere before.

683
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,340
And Liu Guanying encountered it.

684
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,040
No wonder

685
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
he remained so calm about the mirage

686
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,040
that appeared in Dengzhou.

687
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,520
Should we go ask him about it?

688
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,040
If this is his secret,

689
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,159
he'll only tell us the truth

690
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,120
if he wants to.

691
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,679
If he discovered we touched his things,

692
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,480
why did he let us go?

693
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,000
We both know what cards the other holds,

694
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,020
but not how they'll play them.

695
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,380
Let's wait and see.

696
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,440
Better than flipping the table.

697
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,000
You know what,

698
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,640
these vegetable buns are really delicious.

699
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,170
Have one too, Young Master.

700
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,300
I'm not hungry.

701
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,200
On my way here,

702
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,240
I was worried that when I opened the door,

703
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,700
you'd be lying there dead.

704
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,260
Didn't expect you to be so clever.

705
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,320
I learned from you, Young Master.

706
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,520
One takes on the color of one's company.

707
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,920
Didn't someone just walk past us?

708
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,760
Where did they go?

709
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,720
So you're saying

710
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,360
Fei Qi suddenly disappeared?

711
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,880
Yes.

712
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,640
We were clearly walking together just now.

713
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,760
I just sneezed.

714
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,040
Then I heard a thud.

715
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
When I looked back,

716
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,200
I saw the tray on the floor

717
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,840
and Fei Qi was gone.

718
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,500
That's bad.

719
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,240
Not again.

720
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,740
Let's go check inside.

721
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,480
This is terrible!

722
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,210
More people have disappeared!

723
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
Where's Cao Sheng and the others?

724
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,800
Weren't they with you?

725
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,760
No.

726
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,960
It's terrifying.

727
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,720
We thought you had disappeared.

728
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,920
The mirage is gone again.

729
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,600
Could it be...

730
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,370
Let's go to the lake.

731
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,240
You came just in time.

732
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,440
If the Iron Monster is in the city

733
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,600
and we rush in recklessly,

734
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,400
I'm afraid...

735
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,220
Be careful!

736
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,320
It seems to reflect back

737
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,560
the exact force we use against it.

738
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,020
It's like the legendary Golden Bell Shield,

739
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,440
completely impenetrable.

740
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,170
Has this city become sentient?

741
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,520
This is...

742
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,080
Have you heard of such a legend?

743
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,160
Where immortals draw a circle on the ground

744
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,800
and everything inside becomes protected.

745
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,600
Water cannot enter,

746
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,930
and fire cannot burn it.

747
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,920
Could this iron-armored monster really know magic?

748
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,600
The harder it is to enter,

749
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,360
the more mysteries this city must contain.

750
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,540
Planning to dig in from below?

751
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,120
We don't have any other choice.

752
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,320
Then we need to hurry.

753
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,480
Who knows if this city will return to the sky.

754
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,840
Young Master,

755
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,320
these are all grave robbers.

756
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,920
They dug the tunnel under the county office last time.

757
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,480
You did a good job

758
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,800
and kept your mouth shut.

759
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,000
However,

760
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,540
I need payment before doing the work.

761
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,560
Here's 20 taels

762
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,450
as a deposit.

763
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,480
You'll get another 30 when it's done.

764
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,340
Is that enough?

765
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,160
More than enough.

766
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,920
I could dig more than just a tunnel,

767
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,320
even an underground palace for that price.

768
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,000
Let's get going then.

769
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,900
Don't keep Zeng Qian waiting.

770
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,780
Where's Liu Guanying?

771
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,100
He said he's going home

772
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,460
and will join us later.

773
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,610
Let's go.

774
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:54,920
Go.

775
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,720
Young master,

776
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,080
please wait.

777
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,120
I'll go ahead.

778
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,920
See you there.

779
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,560
Let's go.

780
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,410
My father sent you to find me again, didn't he?

781
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,320
Is it because I got all my friends

782
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,940
released from prison?

783
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,280
Sir,

784
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,770
he doesn't even have time for that matter.

785
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,080
Dozens more people have disappeared in the city.

786
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,320
It's nearly 200 people now.

787
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,200
The government office is now filled

788
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,600
with the families of those missing people.

789
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,680
Your father

790
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,520
is worried sick about it.

791
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,800
Don't even talk about finding them.

792
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,840
We can't even finish registering everyone.

793
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,600
The county office's refugee registry is already a thick volume.

794
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
The master asked me to tell you something.

795
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,040
There have been many strange occurrences in Dengzhou lately.

796
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,360
When things are unusual, there must be evil forces at work.

797
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,000
Since you're already out here,

798
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,800
when you act,

799
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,580
keep a low profile.

800
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,760
I understand.

801
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,920
How's the investigation into the family heirloom going?

802
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,650
I've questioned all the servants in the mansion.

803
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,780
None of them seem suspicious.

804
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,960
Young master,

805
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,120
please don't blame me for speaking out of turn.

806
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,280
With your friend

807
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,760
Have you ever mentioned this family heirloom before?

808
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,000
Sir, what are you saying?

809
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,560
Yes.

810
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,640
I may act carelessly sometimes,

811
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,200
but I know what should be said and what shouldn't.

812
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,460
I still have my limits.

813
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,700
All these years I've only told Xing'er about it.

814
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,300
Unless she has issues.

815
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,000
Impossible.

816
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
The young madam is family.

817
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,360
How could she side with outsiders?

818
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,240
Family.

819
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,320
Could it be...

820
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,370
Could it be what?

821
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,360
Nothing.

822
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,200
Sir, you're so busy.

823
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,530
Go ahead with your work.

824
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,720
Remember what the master said.

825
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,840
I got it, I got it.

826
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,680
So nagging.

827
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,280
I've prepared horses for them.

828
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,410
They're just ahead.

829
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,920
Kind person, please help me.

830
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,560
Any small amount would be appreciated.

831
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,290
Thank you, miss.

832
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,760
I've checked.

833
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,800
This Cao Sheng has some background.

834
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,000
His father Cao Jiande is an official in the Ministry of War's Geographical Department.

835
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,440
He draws maps.

836
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,040
He travels all over the country.

837
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,400
Cao Sheng has been following his father, living a nomadic life.

838
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,800
He's been to many places.

839
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,740
Must be quite knowledgeable.

840
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,080
The prisoner escorted into the city by the Qianji Guards a few days ago

841
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,940
was Cao Jiande.

842
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,120
He later died in the county jail.

843
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,620
As for how exactly he died,

844
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,240
even the county officials can't explain clearly.

845
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,840
About this girl called Yunniang,

846
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,040
I haven't found much about her past.

847
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,680
She seems to be just an ordinary maid and bodyguard.

848
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,360
But her martial arts skills are quite good.

849
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,420
You must have witnessed it yourself.

850
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,480
You mentioned those families with missing members,

851
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,680
they're desperate to find them.

852
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,000
That's normal.

853
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,200
But why are these two getting involved?

854
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,840
I'd like to know that too.

855
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,200
Got it.

856
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,240
I'll keep watching them.

857
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,840
If there's any suspicious activity,

858
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,500
I'll notify you immediately.

859
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,320
But this girl,

860
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,380
she's quite generous with her money.

861
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,560
Makes me feel a bit guilty.

862
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,900
Also, those Qianji Guards you asked me to watch,

863
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,640
they seem to have disbanded.

864
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,680
That leader Lin Han,

865
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,760
I don't know where she's hiding now.

866
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,080
Hiding somewhere

867
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,140
you can't find her?

868
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,680
Leave it to me.

869
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,980
Did you take the family heirloom?

870
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,600
Yes, I did.

871
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,960
A long time ago,

872
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,840
I mentioned your family heirloom to Gu Tingmei.

873
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,240
Later he heard

874
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,280
someone was secretly offering a high price for something that's like jade but not jade,

875
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,800
like iron but not iron.

876
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,640
He guessed it was your family heirloom.

877
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,680
His family business was in trouble,

878
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,120
so I gave it to him.

879
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,440
Why would you do that?

880
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,880
Because I care about him.

881
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,680
I'm asking why you're telling me all this.

882
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,040
I understand now.

883
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,650
You're deliberately trying to provoke me

884
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,360
so I'll divorce you, right?

885
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,880
Let me tell you, dream on.

886
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,970
I'm going to find him right now.

887
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,320
I advise you not to spread this around.

888
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,080
This is your Xie family's dirty laundry.

889
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,400
If it gets out,

890
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,460
where will your father hide his face?

891
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,600
Bitch.

892
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,360
You bitch.

893
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,560
Young master.

894
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,540
What's wrong with him now?

895
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,840
Be careful not to say the wrong thing again.

896
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,600
Zeng Qian.

897
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,200
Can you help me steal something?

898
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,520
I know you're a hunter.

899
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,250
But you're also a ghostwriter.

900
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,800
Ghostwriters don't work for free.

901
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,280
So.

902
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,320
Name your price.

903
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,850
Why do you always come to me?

904
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,680
Do I look like a bad person?

905
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,880
Or do I look poor?

906
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,250
Why don't you ask us?

907
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,880
You would help me.

908
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,440
I'm just curious.

909
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,920
One minute you're hiring hitmen.

910
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,720
The next you're hiring thieves.

911
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
What are you up to?

912
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,100
Can't I spend my money however I want?

913
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,690
Who's there?

914
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,480
Definitely not good people.

915
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,160
Do you know martial arts?

916
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,720
No.

917
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,580
What about you?

918
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,440
Then don't get in the way.

919
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,520
This job is too dangerous.

920
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,080
Indeed.

921
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,520
What kind of talk is that?

922
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,440
I'll add fifty taels. Will you do it?

923
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,700
Now that's much safer.

924
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,400
Get to work.

925
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,240
Hurry up.

926
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,720
Who were those people?

927
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:53,840
Not sure.

928
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,840
They were hiding there watching us.

929
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,570
Must be connected to this city.

930
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,880
Could it be those officials from the prefecture?

931
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,210
If it were those people,

932
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,160
even ten of them couldn't get near me.

933
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,880
Those people had good skills.

934
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,280
Judging from their fighting style,

935
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:07,920
they were well-trained,

936
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,240
worked together seamlessly,

937
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,600
not like ordinary thugs.

938
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,680
Your skills don't seem like those of an ordinary soldier either.

939
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,480
That's right.

940
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,200
And that staff of yours,

941
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,300
it can actually block swords.

942
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,640
Is it oak?

943
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,380
It should be ironwood.

944
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,720
Ironwood?

945
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,900
Isn't ironwood just a legend?

946
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,450
Where did you get it?

947
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,780
Won't even let people see your little staff.

948
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,640
You're bleeding.

949
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,240
Old wound.

950
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,120
The wound probably reopened from exertion.

951
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,920
It's nothing.

952
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,400
You're bleeding.

953
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,680
It looks serious.

954
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,720
We have a doctor here.

955
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,780
Let him take a look.

956
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,440
I've already applied medicine.

957
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,800
You might not have used the right medicine.

958
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,130
Better have it checked.

959
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,640
What kind of wound can't be shown to others?

960
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,960
What kind of wound must be shown to you?

961
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,320
Fair enough.

962
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,360
Excuse me for intruding.

963
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,360
What's going on here?

964
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,720
I'll do it myself.

965
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,240
That's a big burn.

966
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,280
How did you get it?

967
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,420
The stove tipped over while I was making flatbread.

968
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,320
What medicine do you think I should use?

969
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,080
I'm sorry.

970
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,040
I thought you were Ye Yao.

971
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,400
I shot his arm with an arrow.

972
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,840
Come on, at a time like this,

973
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,560
you're still concerned about Ye Yao?

974
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,320
Are you that desperate for the bounty?

975
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,440
Why not consider helping me kill someone else?

976
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,770
Or help me steal things.

977
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,600
This tunnel has already been dug beneath the city,

978
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,520
but there's something extremely hard below.

979
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,560
We don't know what it is,

980
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,420
but we can't dig through it at all.

981
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,420
It's neither metal nor stone.

982
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,530
This thing is very strange.

983
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,100
We can't get in from above,

984
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,120
and we can't dig through from below.

985
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,880
No wonder such a large city

986
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,680
dares to be built so boldly here.

987
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,280
That's why the armored men didn't come to stop us.

988
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,760
Including those men in black who retreated so easily.

989
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,200
It's because they knew

990
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,200
that even if we dug through the tunnel,

991
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,060
we still couldn't enter the city.

992
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,530
Do you have any other ideas?

993
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,640
Why do you think I have a solution?

994
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,280
Your daughter might be in there.

995
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,740
You think I'm not anxious?

996
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,060
Use gunpowder.

997
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,560
It's probably not enough,

998
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,360
but it's the only option we have.

999
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,240
Then we need to go back to the county office.

1000
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,360
We can bring out the cannons

1001
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,680
and blast the city gate.

1002
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,680
I refuse to believe we can't get in.

1003
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,740
But the cannons...

1004
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,360
Young master!

1005
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,680
What happened?

1006
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,600
It's nothing.

1007
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,860
I've seen this before.

1008
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,890
He'll wake up in about half an hour.

1009
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,740
Hey, Zeng Qian.

1010
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,920
Didn't you say it would be half an hour?

1011
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,640
It's been a whole hour already.

1012
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,920
Last time it was half an hour.

1013
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,720
What's going on here, Yun Niang?

1014
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,040
We've been sitting here for ages.

1015
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,900
And you haven't told us anything.

1016
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,160
The young master has had this strange condition since childhood.

1017
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,560
The doctor calls it

1018
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,120
narcolepsy.

1019
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,000
He suddenly falls asleep for no apparent reason.

1020
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,320
They say when he was little, the episodes were less frequent

1021
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,920
and he would wake up quickly.

1022
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,460
But as he grew older, the episodes became more frequent

1023
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,360
and he sleeps for longer periods.

1024
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,210
So last time it was half an hour.

1025
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,440
This time will be longer.

1026
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,210
I've read about this condition in medical books.

1027
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,760
It's extremely rare

1028
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,680
and incurable.

1029
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,880
They say it gets progressively worse.

1030
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,720
What do you mean incurable?

1031
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,560
The young master definitely doesn't have what you're talking about.

1032
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,440
Shut up.

1033
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,440
When it happens, there are no warning signs.

1034
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,840
That's quite dangerous.

1035
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,840
What if it happens while he's riding a horse or swimming?

1036
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,800
So whenever the young master goes horseback riding,

1037
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,400
I pay extra attention to him.

1038
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,040
And because of this,

1039
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,120
the master has never allowed him to learn martial arts since childhood.

1040
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,080
Learning martial arts would inevitably lead to fighting with others.

1041
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,740
If his condition were to flare up during a fight,

1042
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,400
it would be disastrous.

1043
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,560
I thought so.

1044
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,160
Someone as clever as him,

1045
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,280
how could he not know martial arts?

1046
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,440
The best swimmers are the ones who drown.

1047
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,700
That's exactly right.

1048
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,200
When I was little,

1049
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,560
my father was afraid I'd get into danger playing in the river,

1050
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,960
so he wouldn't let me learn how to swim.

1051
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,160
Later, when I was 17,

1052
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,840
I finally learned it secretly on my own.

1053
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,400
Now that I think about it, not knowing martial arts

1054
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,730
is actually quite good.

1055
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,200
Running away from danger

1056
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,440
is actually the best strategy.

1057
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,360
You're talking about yourself, aren't you?

1058
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,760
Let me make something clear.

1059
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,240
I, Xie Jingtang, wasn't being a coward just now.

1060
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,560
I was afraid of holding you all back.

1061
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,290
That's what Cao Sheng said too.

1062
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,560
What did I say?

1063
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,400
Young master,

1064
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,240
you're awake.

1065
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,220
Why are you all still here?

1066
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,250
Should we have left you here alone?

1067
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,600
Alright,

1068
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,680
let's go.

1069
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,020
Go back and bring the cannons.

1070
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,770
We'll bombard the city.

1071
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,840
You up there, open the gate now!

1072
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,090
Who's there?

1073
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,250
What do you want?

1074
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,000
What do I want?

1075
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,560
Tell your boss to come talk to me.

1076
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,920
Who are you?

1077
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,850
Why so arrogant?

1078
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,600
He doesn't even recognize me.

1079
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,180
It's Young Master Xie!

1080
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,360
Please wait.

1081
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,920
I'll have someone open the gate for you.

1082
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,200
What took you so long?

1083
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,040
Hurry up.

1084
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,520
Open the gate!

1085
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,680
After you.

1086
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,680
Who is it?

1087
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,940
What's your business?

1088
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,880
Guards!

1089
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,520
On alert!

1090
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,880
Close the gate!

1091
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,960
Gangzi.

1092
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,160
Is that your brother?

1093
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,320
Yes, that's my brother.

1094
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,460
Isn't that the daughter from old Zhang's rice shop?

1095
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,320
Aren't these all the people who went missing recently?

1096
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,880
The missing people are back!

1097
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,480
They're at the south gate.

1098
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,460
Hurry and get your people!

1099
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,960
Everyone go claim your family members!

1100
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,560
Hurry up!

1101
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,240
They're back.

1102
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,880
Everyone stay where you are.

1103
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,960
Don't run around.

1104
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,090
Wait for your families to come get you.

1105
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,460
Do you understand?

1106
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,000
Everyone remain calm.

1107
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Don't wander off.

1108
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,450
Wait for your families to collect you.

1109
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,360
What's wrong, Tongtong?

1110
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,040
Who are you?

1111
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,160
Ergouzi.

1112
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,120
What's wrong?

1113
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,320
Don't you recognize me?

1114
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,080
I'm your father!

1115
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,800
Pay me back quickly.

1116
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,840
Don't pretend you don't know me.

1117
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,040
I've been looking for you all day.

1118
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,480
Whether you remember things or not,

1119
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,080
let's go home first and talk.

1120
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,540
What's wrong with you?

1121
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,400
Don't you recognize me anymore?

1122
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,210
Now I see why they sent me to get you.

1123
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,680
You don't even remember where you live.

1124
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,160
Why don't these people recognize their own families?

1125
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,130
Soul loss syndrome.

1126
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,040
Huzi!

1127
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,240
You're finally back.

1128
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,600
Where did you go?

1129
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,720
Who are you?

1130
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,120
I'm your third brother!

1131
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,450
Don't you recognize me?

1132
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,730
Little One-eye!

1133
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,400
Kid!

1134
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,360
Who are you?

1135
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:38,920
What do you want?

1136
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,380
No more talk. Come with me.

1137
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,160
You know me?

1138
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,570
Little One-eye.

1139
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,880
Who am I exactly?

1140
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,000
Let me ask you something.

1141
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,360
Have you seen a little one-eyed beggar?

1142
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,600
I think he just ran past us.

1143
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,700
Which way did he go?

1144
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,010
I didn't notice.

1145
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,760
Xie Jingtang.

1146
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,600
Have you seen my brother?

1147
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,420
If I had seen him, I would have brought him to you.

1148
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,610
We're heading back now.

1149
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,360
What's going on here?

1150
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,960
Young Master,

1151
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,530
why don't we see Zeng Xin anywhere?

1152
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,370
I just asked around.

1153
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,960
They said that little beggar ran away.

1154
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,720
Do you think Zeng Xin might have done the same?

1155
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,320
He came back,

1156
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,040
but went somewhere else.

1157
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,600
Look, don't worry.

1158
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,730
Let's keep looking.

1159
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,360
Get out of the way.

1160
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,420
What are you doing?

1161
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,960
Move aside.

1162
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,560
Step back.

1163
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,080
The city in the lake is gone.

1164
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,460
And it hasn't returned to the sky.
