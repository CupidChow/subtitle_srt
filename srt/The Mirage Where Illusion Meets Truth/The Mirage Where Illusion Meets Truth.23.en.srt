1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,560
Now that you have this mutation vessel,

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,090
you have enough leverage to negotiate with the King of Jingnan.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,290
If we have enough leverage,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,330
why do we still need to negotiate with him?

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,760
Although Tongtong can reverse the process

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,240
to awaken Zeng Xin and the others' souls,

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,080
we still need to locate the mirage

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,760
and remove the outer protection.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,360
Don't we still need the King of Jingnan's help?

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
We need him,

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,130
but not his help.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,480
The King of Jingnan is unpredictable

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,610
and untrustworthy.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Besides, we don't have time to keep playing his games.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,080
We can't find the mirage,

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,640
but we can make the mirage

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,560
come to us.

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,720
So

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,240
I have a plan.

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,920
Daozi is keeping watch outside,

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,180
so we can speak freely.

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,560
As expected,

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,840
the King of Jingnan has placed spies

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,040
both inside and outside Qingfeng Tower.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,800
Isn't it risky for us

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,860
to take back the mutation vessel?

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,800
Our acquisition of the mutation vessel was unexpected,

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,880
he couldn't possibly know

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,680
we have something so important.

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,360
What he currently wants

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,240
is still just the location of Man Zhudai.

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,840
The most important thing now

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,920
is to quickly deliver the mutation vessel to Baili Yuan.

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,250
So we need to put on a show

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,480
to make the King of Jingnan believe.

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,680
Believe that we've truly retrieved the mutation vessel.

37
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,160
Believe that Tongtong

38
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,520
has truly betrayed us.

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,560
Mom.

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,600
Let me cook the remaining dumplings,

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,130
you should rest for a while.

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,039
Why haven't we heard

43
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,370
from Young Master Xie these past few days?

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,540
Tongtong took the mutation vessel away.

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Fortune telling!

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
Want to know your yearly fortune?

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,440
Come get your fortune told!

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
She must be trying to leave the city now.

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,600
Turning misfortune into blessing!

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Come get your fortune told!

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,360
Tongtong stole the Transformation Vessel and left Qingfeng Tower.

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
If Baili Yuan gets the Transformation Vessel,

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,320
then my minerals will be useless.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,640
Think about the consequences.

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,120
The Transformation Vessel can transform minerals.

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,360
It prevents outsiders from coming here.

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,240
If it falls into Baili Yuan's hands,

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
the result will be exactly the opposite.

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,720
For the King of Jingnan,

60
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,760
this would be a devastating blow,

61
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,000
he could lose everything.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,600
In that case,

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,530
he would have to use his trump card.

64
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,400
Do you remember what Baili Yuan and Zeng Qian said

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,200
about the King of Jingnan's trump card?

66
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,680
The 200 outsiders in Dengzhou

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
are essentially the King of Jingnan's hostages.

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,450
He can use their lives to threaten Baili Yuan.

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,560
What Baili Yuan really cares about

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,890
isn't these 200 people?

71
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,200
He cares about those outsiders who haven't arrived yet.

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Baili Yuan said

73
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,840
that distant outsiders can use mirages

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,440
to connect with the eyes of outsiders here.

75
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,220
When a mirage appears,

76
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,640
everything seen by nearby outsiders

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,360
will be visible to people in that distant place.

78
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,079
If we push the King of Jingnan too far...

79
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,600
He will definitely make a move against the outsiders in Dengzhou.

80
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
He will then control the mirage to appear in Dengzhou.

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,940
Making the distant outsiders watch,

82
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,720
to force Baili Yuan to submit.

83
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,360
Even if this plan works,

84
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,400
and the mirage appears again in Dengzhou,

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,600
how do we break through its protection?

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,880
We can't get the iron-armored man's device from the King of Jingnan.

87
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,740
Then we can only

88
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,180
rely on He Xiguang's halberd.

89
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,720
He will help us.

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,780
It's not that he's helping us,

91
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,100
he's helping himself.

92
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,560
I've told you so much,

93
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,280
not because I need your help.

94
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,320
I just want to tell you the truth.

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,600
Your child

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,520
is indeed gone.

97
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Before you came,

98
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,720
she was already sick.

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,600
You know this.

100
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,970
Those people from above

101
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,140
didn't save her in the end.

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,660
I was the one who claimed her body,

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,170
and conducted the Agu burial according to her last wish.

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
She said it was a promise between you two.

105
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,280
I wasn't planning to tell you about this.

106
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,920
Because coming here

107
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,960
has been painful enough for you.

108
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,840
And sometimes

109
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,480
it's better not to know.

110
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,680
But I can't bear to see you

111
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,480
risking your life for people who don't deserve it.

112
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
What's lost can never be recovered.

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,440
You can have your own future.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,659
You should be yourself again.

115
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,240
Your enemies are on our side,

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,720
not here.

117
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,770
If you want revenge,

118
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,600
you must deal with the Jingnan King's Jiya.

119
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,680
I have something here

120
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
that I need you to deliver to

121
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,200
either He Xiguang or Baili Yuan.

122
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,080
Once the King of Jingnan learns you've taken the Transformation Vessel,

123
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
he might give it to Baili Yuan at any moment.

124
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,960
His most effective method

125
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,360
would be to send Ji Ya to intercept and kill.

126
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,520
By then, you'll inevitably encounter He Xiguang's Ji Ya.

127
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,250
Both sides are evenly matched.

128
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,490
Once they clash,

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,080
it's hard to say who will prevail,

130
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,840
who will win.

131
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,040
Moreover,

132
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,810
it will also attract that invisible monster.

133
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,760
What are you pouring tree oil there for?

134
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
To increase our chances of success.

135
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,280
The Transformation Vessel

136
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,140
can not only transform minerals,

137
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,760
but also transform

138
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,410
the refined Qiu stones.

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,080
If you want those who deceived you to pay the price,

140
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
then deliver this

141
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,200
to He Xiguang.

142
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,400
Go report to Lord Baili now.

143
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
The time has come.

144
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
Our plan can proceed.

145
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,720
Young Master.

146
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,680
Although as we expected,

147
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,900
the mirage appeared on schedule.

148
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,400
But the King of Jingnan told you

149
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
that if Tongtong helps us,

150
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,040
she will die too.

151
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,080
Is it possible

152
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,220
that she's deceiving us again

153
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,440
and actually using herself as bait?

154
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,360
No, she's not.

155
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,000
Why?

156
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,700
Just a feeling.

157
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,880
A feeling?

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,660
Thank you for believing in me.

159
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,080
This pattern is...

160
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,330
This is the emblem of Hengchongdu.

161
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
In the third year of Yuantai,

162
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,730
the Emperor of Dian led his army south.

163
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,090
With his cavalry, the Iron Pagoda,

164
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,450
they were unstoppable,

165
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,140
conquering seven cities in ten days.

166
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,120
Until

167
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,900
they encountered the Hengchongdu of Da Yin.

168
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,000
Five hundred Hengchongdu warriors

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,600
slaughtered six thousand Iron Pagoda soldiers.

170
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,640
In a single night,

171
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,080
they wiped out Dian's fearsome elite force

172
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,800
from existence.

173
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Later,

174
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,180
when Da Yin unified the realm,

175
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
the Emperor feared the Hengchongdu

176
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,210
and disbanded them.

177
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,140
Their weapons were confiscated.

178
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,880
Five hundred broadswords

179
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,810
were all destroyed in the furnace.

180
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,120
So this knife

181
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,080
must be a hidden gem.

182
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,560
Xie Jingtang sharpened this knife so well.

183
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,460
He must have put in a lot of effort.

184
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,040
Mother.

185
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,090
I need to take Tongtong on another long trip soon.

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,360
How long will you be gone this time?

187
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,800
I don't know.

188
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,160
I know there are things you don't tell me

189
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,610
because you don't want me to worry.

190
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,560
I want you to know

191
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,450
that no matter what,

192
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,580
as long as you believe it's right,

193
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,340
just go ahead and do it.

194
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,520
By the way,

195
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,100
I've finished making your new shoes.

196
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,280
Here,

197
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,800
try them on.

198
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,880
This is all we can do.

199
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,760
Our young master

200
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,720
is in your hands now.

201
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,000
Reverse control.

202
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,080
The real Tongtong will return.

203
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,720
My soul will return to the mirage.

204
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,200
This should

205
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,080
be the last time we see each other.

206
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,080
The mirage will eventually be destroyed.

207
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,410
What will happen to you?

208
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,640
You always advised me

209
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,800
to leave this body.

210
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,880
You said

211
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
that following you like this

212
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,820
must be painful for me.

213
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,080
You also said

214
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,120
that coming from so far away,

215
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,930
this couldn't be what I wanted.

216
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,000
But

217
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,680
I want to tell you

218
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,530
that the time I spent with all of you

219
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,760
has been

220
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
the happiest time of my life.

221
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

222
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,000
Thank you all.

223
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Don't forget

224
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm just an old woman.

225
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
In this lifetime

226
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,260
I have no regrets anymore.

227
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,000
Let's begin.

228
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,760
The only thing that can control the City of Rebirth

229
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,690
and remove its protective barrier

230
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,640
is the King of Jingnan's halberd tooth.

231
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,000
The item that removes the protection

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,640
is hidden in his armor.

233
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,760
You knew I couldn't spare more men

234
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,900
so you dared to bring so few people

235
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
and sit there so arrogantly.

236
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,640
However,

237
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,080
I'm running out of patience now.

238
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,880
If I don't get the Transformation Vessel within half an hour,

239
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,410
I'll order my men to set fire

240
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
and burn those 200 outsiders to death.

241
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,000
You'll be held responsible for this

242
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,020
since you chose to do nothing.

243
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,160
When the outsiders come again,

244
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,040
they won't cooperate with you anymore.

245
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,320
It's not worth it,

246
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,520
Lord Baili.

247
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,120
I'll send someone to get it right away.

248
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,320
Give me one hour.

249
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,320
I know you're stalling,

250
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,440
but what's the point?

251
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,040
And stop pretending,

252
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,920
Lord Baili.

253
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,800
The outsiders can only see us

254
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
but can't hear what we're saying.

255
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,840
So,

256
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,840
you only need to look anxious and worried

257
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,920
without shouting so loudly.

258
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,120
Report!

259
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,040
Your Majesty,

260
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,880
someone is climbing the mirage.

261
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,620
After all this acting,

262
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,860
you people are still the best actors around.

263
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,440
This rope can't stay here.

264
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,600
If it's discovered,

265
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,240
Baili Yuan's or the Prince of Jingnan's men

266
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
might climb up using it.

267
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,920
How will the young master and others come down?

268
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,440
They'll pull the rope all the way up.

269
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,040
When they come down, they'll just lower the rope to the ground.

270
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,440
But the rope might not be long enough.

271
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,560
We need to bring the cart over.

272
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,890
There's more rope on it.

273
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,020
What about the cannon?

274
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,800
Advisor Geng will arrange for someone to remove it.

275
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,360
Here's the plan:

276
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
I'll go get the cart,

277
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,420
you untie the rope.

278
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,160
We've entered the city.

279
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,400
Feeling better now?

280
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,000
At least there's not so much wind.

281
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,220
I thought there was nothing in this city.

282
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,480
Even though it's just for disguise,

283
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,410
it still needs to look convincing.

284
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,280
Turn right ahead and keep going to reach our destination.

285
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,880
There's a great hall there.

286
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,570
We should make our move now.

287
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,480
So you're saying

288
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,810
those are all Baili Yuan's people.

289
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,560
He already sent people to infiltrate the city,

290
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,360
just waiting for us to capture these outsiders.

291
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,800
Then, while our forces are scattered,

292
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,330
they'll defeat us one by one

293
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,320
and rescue the outsiders.

294
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,680
On the contrary.

295
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,920
That spy you mentioned

296
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,200
has been assigned to work in the front yard.

297
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,760
Someone is watching him closely.

298
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,890
We can speak freely.

299
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,000
No wonder they say Qingfeng House can't function without you.

300
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,860
You flatter me.

301
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,800
I'm mainly hoping that all of you

302
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,040
can save our master.

303
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,210
Thank you for your help.

304
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,120
The entire city is under martial law now.

305
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,780
But not all areas are guarded.

306
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,760
Even if there are guards, they're just scattered few.

307
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,200
It won't affect our plan.

308
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,040
Besides,

309
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,770
we have the tunnel map of Dengzhou.

310
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,560
These are the tunnels that Cao Zhong and others dug back then.

311
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,890
We won't be detected if we use the tunnels.

312
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,800
Next,

313
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,250
all of us need to act according to the plan.

314
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,920
You're here. Have a seat.

315
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,160
Thank you.

316
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,800
A few days ago,

317
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,960
Brother Bao told me there were many more beggars in the city.

318
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,600
He found it strange and investigated.

319
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,280
He discovered not only were there more beggars,

320
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,680
but also many more peddlers and travelers.

321
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,720
These people disguised themselves very well,

322
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,780
but Brother Bao still figured it out.

323
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,370
They're from Chenzhou.

324
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,760
Baili Yuan's people.

325
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,640
Most likely.

326
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,080
What do they want by infiltrating here?

327
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,920
To rescue someone?

328
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,040
They arrived several days in advance.

329
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,800
The mirage hadn't appeared then.

330
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,200
And these people hadn't been captured yet.

331
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
There must be

332
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,450
something more to this.

333
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,600
We managed to leave Chenzhou safely a few days ago.

334
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,840
Apart from the King of Jingnan's Royal Guards covering our retreat,

335
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,320
we relied more on luck.

336
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
And what I trust least

337
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
is luck.

338
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,840
You suspect

339
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,840
Baili Yuan deliberately arranged this

340
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,080
to continue using us?

341
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,920
If that's possible,

342
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,480
it means what we want to do

343
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,960
is also what he wants.

344
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,840
Just like when we went to him for help before,

345
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,400
it was actually what he wanted us to do.

346
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,160
So you're saying all our current plans

347
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,960
are under Baili Yuan's control.

348
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,360
Report!

349
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,920
Cao Sheng and his group have left Chenzhou

350
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,760
heading toward Jiuyuan Mountain.

351
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,040
Call the scouts back.

352
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,440
No need to keep following them,

353
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,800
lest we alert them to our presence.

354
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,330
Yes, sir.

355
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
We found the ore through Manzhudai.

356
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,240
He must have anticipated that.

357
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,970
He might even have anticipated

358
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,410
that beneath Manzhudai

359
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,160
there's a transformation vessel.

360
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,800
But setting a trap to make the King of Jingnan control the mirage to Dengzhou,

361
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,200
then using the outsider's life to threaten him -

362
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,960
we only thought of that after reaching the mountains.

363
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,440
How could he have anticipated that?

364
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,370
We set a trap for the King of Jingnan

365
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,100
because we knew about his so-called trump card.

366
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,660
But who told us about that trump card?

367
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
It was Bai Liyuan.

368
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,720
The Prince of Jingnan brought so few men

369
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,980
yet dares to stay in Dengzhou for so long.

370
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,680
Don't you find it strange?

371
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,880
I heard from Cao Sheng

372
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,440
that the Prince of Jingnan

373
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,100
has his so-called trump card.

374
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,320
Dengzhou

375
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,690
has nearly two hundred outsiders.

376
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,500
They cannot leave that place yet.

377
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,120
If the Prince of Jingnan discovers any unusual movement here,

378
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,840
he will certainly use those lives

379
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,360
to threaten me.

380
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,080
I didn't explicitly ask him about this.

381
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,840
But he took my cue

382
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,240
and told me everything about it.

383
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,040
The King of Jingnan's trump card

384
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,220
is Bai Liyuan's most fatal weakness.

385
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,920
I once asked the King of Jingnan what his trump card was,

386
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,800
and he kept his lips tightly sealed.

387
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,520
It's called a trump card for a reason.

388
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,680
You don't really think I'd tell you, do you?

389
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,540
But Bai Liyuan,

390
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,800
why would he so readily

391
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,260
expose his weakness to us?

392
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,400
That can only mean one thing.

393
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,080
He wants us to use this weakness.

394
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,080
The more you explain, the more confused I get.

395
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,740
By exploiting this weakness,

396
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,480
wouldn't he be put at a disadvantage?

397
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,740
The King of Jingnan captured those outsiders as hostages.

398
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,290
Since Baili Yuan cares so much about them,

399
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,730
he would surely comply.

400
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,680
Whatever demands the King of Jingnan makes,

401
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,340
he would agree to them, right?

402
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,440
Why would he

403
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,130
deliberately put himself in such a disadvantageous position?

404
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,360
You make a good point about taking initiative.

405
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,680
Since he's taking the initiative,

406
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,160
it means the situation

407
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,760
won't be completely disadvantageous to him.

408
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,440
Remember how

409
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,570
Baili Yuan schemed against us before?

410
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,580
He let us win to catch us later.

411
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,200
People are often like this.

412
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
What they obtain passively or by accident,

413
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,930
they tend to undervalue and doubt.

414
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,800
What we actively strive for

415
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,480
is what we cherish and believe in.

416
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,360
This man,

417
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
the more he wants something,

418
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,720
the more he pretends not to care,

419
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,380
and even denies or resists it.

420
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,000
Following this logic,

421
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,360
it's not hard to imagine

422
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,760
what his true purpose is.

423
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,800
He keeps emphasizing

424
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,080
that he cares about the safety of those outsiders.

425
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,660
If we think in reverse,

426
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,440
he actually wants those outsiders dead.

427
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,080
But

428
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,280
what would he gain from this?

429
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,000
You know your people best.

430
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,960
If all the outsiders were killed,

431
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,890
what actions would your side take?

432
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,920
Last time, Cao Jiande killed those thousands of rebels at Huo River,

433
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,960
causing all souls in the mirage to perish.

434
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,760
We then sent those two Jiya warriors.

435
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,760
Even at a tremendous cost.

436
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,320
So after all this talk,

437
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,160
why did Baili Yuan bring so many people here?

438
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,280
What does he want?

439
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
Actually, the King of Jingnan

440
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,690
will only use those 200 lives as leverage.

441
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,570
He won't actually harm them

442
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,700
unless he wants mutual destruction.

443
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,880
And Baili Yuan

444
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,570
can't actively push him to that point either.

445
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,800
So the best solution

446
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,450
is for Baili Yuan to act personally

447
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,080
and then make the outsiders

448
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,080
mistakenly believe it was the King of Jingnan's doing.

449
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,440
That's why Baili Yuan's people came to Dengzhou.

450
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,240
It's to wait for an opportunity.

451
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,960
And this opportunity

452
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,290
is to set a trap for the King of Jingnan,

453
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,680
making him control the mirage to Dengzhou.

454
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,739
Then we'll capture those 200 people.

455
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,719
The King of Jingnan doesn't have many people at Wuji Temple.

456
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,449
When his forces are scattered,

457
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,530
Baili Yuan's people can take advantage of the chaos,

458
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,889
disguise themselves as the King's men

459
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,290
and kill all the outsiders.

460
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,520
If these two hundred foreigners die unnatural deaths again,

461
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,760
I'm afraid we'll face more than just these two warriors.

462
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,400
Every grievance has its source.

463
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,280
Whoever kills these two hundred foreigners,

464
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,239
they will seek revenge against them.

465
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,040
This is also why Bai Liyuan

466
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,900
wants the King of Jingnan to kill these foreigners.

467
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,120
They might blame Bai Liyuan for failing to rescue them.

468
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,159
But most of their fury

469
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,040
will still be directed at the King of Jingnan.

470
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,840
This way,

471
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,639
Baili Yuan can eliminate the King of Jingnan

472
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,880
without completely offending the outsiders.

473
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,639
Killing two birds with one stone.

474
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,900
The perfect solution.

475
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,530
This way, not only the outsiders will die.

476
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,640
Those physical bodies will be gone,

477
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,080
and those 200 citizens of Dengzhou will die too.

478
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,620
As long as we board the Mirage,

479
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,200
Tongtong can perform reverse control

480
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,530
and destroy the Mirage.

481
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,160
At that time,

482
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,040
not only will the 200 outsiders turn back into Dengzhou citizens,

483
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,800
but also because the Mirage will be gone.

484
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,760
Those people from beyond

485
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,320
can no longer see what's happening on our side.

486
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,480
Everything Baili Yuan has done is in vain.

487
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,600
Baili Yuan knows all our plans.

488
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,300
He will certainly send people to stop us.

489
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,600
Whether we go to Shenjing

490
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,770
or rescue those 200 people,

491
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,540
danger awaits us everywhere.

492
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Let's think about the positive side.

493
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,220
At least we know his plans too.

494
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,160
The mantis stalks the cicada,

495
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,760
but the oriole waits behind.

496
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,120
Yet behind the oriole

497
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,450
there's still a slingshot.

498
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,160
This old fox

499
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,400
wants to use me

500
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,640
to kill the people from beyond.

501
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,920
Forget it.

502
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,920
The more I say now,

503
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,280
the more pleased he becomes.

504
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,520
I never thought

505
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,700
that after playing this game for so long,

506
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,200
I would still lose in the end.

507
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,360
We can escort you out of Dengzhou.

508
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,960
We're confident about that.

509
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,840
It's useless.

510
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,560
Now,

511
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,860
the biggest threat isn't Baili Yuan.

512
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,640
Nor is it the people from beyond who will seek revenge against me.

513
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,920
It's those fellows on Shenjing.

514
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,320
If they succeed,

515
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,200
I'll be completely destroyed.

516
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,800
I can lose,

517
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,960
but I cannot die.

518
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,960
We won't lose.

519
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,240
I'll rush over to save those people from beyond.

520
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,120
It's too late.

521
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,840
You'll die.

522
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,880
Wait.

523
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,000
You just said your Ji Ya can break through the mirage's protection.

524
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Why not destroy the mirage directly?

525
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,120
I wish I could.

526
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,890
Unfortunately,

527
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,640
it's not that simple.

528
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,400
So even if the King of Jingnan's Ji Ya carries that object,

529
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,880
it still can't remove this protection, right?

530
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,360
This is the most important place in the City of Rebirth.

531
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,040
The protection level is different.

532
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,520
Only I can destroy it.

533
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,200
That's why he couldn't destroy the mirage.

534
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,130
His Majesty commands to light the fire immediately.

535
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,960
What are you waiting for?

536
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,680
Light it!

537
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,800
Stop!

538
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,520
I am Nangong Yu, Commander of the Qianji Guard's Yu Division.

539
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,120
Here is the Dragon Insignia.

540
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,400
His Majesty commands

541
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,880
that the fire must not be lit.

542
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,160
You're falsely conveying orders

543
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,960
and defying imperial commands.

544
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,530
Imperial commands?

545
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,080
Does your master Baili Yuan

546
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,520
have the authority to issue imperial commands?

547
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,800
A thief crying 'catch the thief.'

548
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,080
You're preventing us from lighting the fire.

549
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,160
I think you're actually Baili Yuan's secret agent.

550
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,220
Light the fire now!

551
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,040
Sir,

552
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,940
the King of Jingnan is no longer on the city wall.

553
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Begin.

554
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,960
Yes, sir.

555
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,480
We'll hold our position.

556
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,760
Your people

557
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,840
understand this, right?

558
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,680
Attacking the city would make it seem like

559
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,080
you're deliberately pressuring the King of Jingnan,

560
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,610
forcing him to burn those outsiders to death.

561
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,000
Then you'd be held responsible.

562
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,880
The King of Jingnan

563
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,040
must suspect we have troops in ambush

564
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,560
and won't dare leave the city.

565
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,880
This standoff serves as a distraction

566
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,730
that benefits our operation on the mountain.

567
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,000
Indeed.

568
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,920
Our people can't enter the city to rescue them directly.

569
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,680
It would enrage the King

570
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,210
and make him light the fire.

571
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,560
So we can only protect the mirage.

572
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,800
After all,

573
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,440
if Tongtong succeeds,

574
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,760
nearly 200 outsiders will perish.

575
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,320
By protecting Shenjing, we're protecting the outsiders.

576
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,580
This is the only thing we can do right now.

577
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Your people should understand that.

578
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,680
Just now,

579
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,720
did you also call them outsiders?

580
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,480
Put Xie Jingtang on this.

581
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,800
What's next?

582
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,400
Just wait here.

583
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
Is what's on here

584
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,960
happening right now?

585
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,500
This white light in front of us

586
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,140
will turn completely blue

587
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
when the reverse control succeeds.

588
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,600
From now on,

589
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,370
I can't leave this place

590
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,600
or all our efforts will be wasted.

591
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
It's up to you now.

592
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,000
These soldiers belong to Baili Yuan.

593
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,860
But how did they get into the city?

594
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,720
Of course,

595
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,440
the same way you did.

596
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,400
I never expected

597
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,640
that she would actually help you

598
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,280
and risk her life for you.

599
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,800
If

600
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,640
she doesn't stop,

601
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,440
not only will she die,

602
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,280
I will die too, sister.

603
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,840
You have to die

604
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,520
so my brother can live.

605
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,500
This is your retribution.

606
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,640
What if

607
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,000
I must stop her?

608
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,000
Then you'll die now.

609
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,200
You think

610
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,940
two against one gives you the advantage?

611
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,810
Baili Yuan sent more people

612
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,440
than just these few.

613
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,840
You've destroyed the mirage.

614
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,290
What will happen to Baili Yuan now?

615
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,000
So their purpose is the same as mine.

616
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,500
They may be slow to reach the city,

617
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,120
but they will come

618
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,880
wave after wave.

619
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,080
When that happens,

620
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,600
how long can you hold out?

621
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,040
Look,

622
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,520
my helpers have arrived.

623
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,320
You don't like it when I kill him either.

624
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,600
I leave this place to you.

625
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,580
I'll take care of outside.

626
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,760
When the Emperor is enraged, countless corpses will fall.

627
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,120
If the Emperor wants you dead,

628
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,160
then you must die.

629
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,400
Sister.

630
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,170
Raising my hand against you

631
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,080
is the last thing I want to do.

632
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
Fighting you

633
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,700
is actually something I'd enjoy.

634
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,920
Sister.

635
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,260
You didn't use your arrows

636
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,960
because you were afraid of killing me,

637
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,560
right?

638
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,880
If this body is gone,

639
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,640
then your Axin

640
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,040
will never return.

641
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,000
Why are you posing like that?

642
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,920
Aren't you tired?
