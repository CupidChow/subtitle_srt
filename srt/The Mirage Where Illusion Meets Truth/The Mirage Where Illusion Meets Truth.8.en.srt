1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,960
Didn't you want to know how my comrade died?

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,920
I'll tell you.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,930
He was stabbed through the chest with a sword.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,450
The owner of that sword was Lin Han.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,680
Lin Han wouldn't kill without reason.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,320
Someone must have been behind it.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,240
Now it seems

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,640
the person who ordered her was your father,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,920
Cao Jiande.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,560
Even if Lin Han was under my father's command,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,960
why would my father want to kill your comrade?

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
What's the necessary connection between them?

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,160
Judging from your father's painting,

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,820
he must have been near the Huo River at that time.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,580
This is my father's handwriting.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,080
The 38th year of Jingyun.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
Something significant happened that year.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,010
The Battle of Wusuling.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,760
I heard that

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,040
the rebels were defeated

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,640
and their remnants fled to the Huo River area.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,700
My father drew the exact same mirage.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,280
It means he was there too.

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,360
My comrades just located the rebels' hideout.

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,560
was killed by Lin Han.

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Lin Han was taking orders from your father.

27
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,160
Therefore,

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,120
your father must have had some connection with the rebels.

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,880
Or rather,

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,600
perhaps the deaths of thousands of rebels

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,330
are all related to your father.

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,320
Weren't those rebels killed by the Prince of Jingnan?

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,000
That's the court's official version.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,660
When the Prince of Jingnan replaced Baili Yuan,

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
he quickly found those rebels.

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,600
But in fact, all the rebels were already dead.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,259
And they died from poisoning.

38
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,880
The Prince of Jingnan

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
just took the credit.

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
My father wasn't responsible for suppressing the rebellion.

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,650
Why would he kill thousands of rebels?

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,720
Then go ask him yourself.

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,960
I've been taught by you since childhood

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,800
that even insects and ants are living beings.

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,080
So why are tens of thousands of lives now

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,800
worth nothing more than grass in your eyes?

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,720
Do you know,

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,320
sometimes killing is done to save others.

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
I've said before,

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,280
I want the truth.

51
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,240
Cao Jiande is determined to kill Guan Ying.

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,320
Why?

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
What's going on here?

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,840
The person who ordered you back then was his father,

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,640
Cao Jiande.

56
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,170
You killed his comrades

57
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,540
on my father's orders?

58
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,640
And

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,730
those thousands of rebels,

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,210
did my father really kill them?

61
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
What you're doing is pointless.

62
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,480
It might have worked with his father.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,930
Unfortunately,

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,980
the only person who could make me compromise

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
is gone now.

66
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
You want to avenge my father,

67
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,900
but you're powerless.

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,360
The Iron Man is so difficult to deal with

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,290
because we know nothing about him.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Before my father died,

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,020
he seemed to anticipate the Iron Man's arrival.

72
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,480
Death is inevitable.

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,280
I only want to protect my father

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,480
and leave this place.

75
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,040
No matter what difficulties lie ahead,

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,170
I am willing to stand

77
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,500
with my father.

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
You have no idea

79
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,760
what you're about to face.

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,159
What exactly was the relationship between my father and the Iron Man?

81
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,290
How much did he know about the secrets behind the mirage?

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,020
What's the connection between the Iron Man and the mirage?

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,440
Once all these mysteries are solved,

84
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,300
many questions will be answered.

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,890
Including how to avenge my father.

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
But now the key to solving these mysteries lies with you.

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,920
You can choose to say nothing,

88
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,050
even take these secrets to your grave.

89
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,680
But what's the point?

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,280
All of you want the truth.

91
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
But some truths

92
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,340
are not something everyone can bear.

93
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,480
That's our concern.

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,840
You must promise me one thing,

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,560
Feng Buhai.

96
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,880
After I tell you everything,

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,850
you'll surely want to kill me to avenge Liu Guanying.

98
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,560
But I can't die now.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,659
After I've avenged my master,

100
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
I'll come to you myself

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,120
and accept my execution.

102
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,080
Not possible.

103
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,840
Whether you get your revenge or not doesn't matter to me.

104
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,320
But killing you

105
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,920
is important to me.

106
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,160
Then you'll never get the truth.

107
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,620
I can do without the truth.

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,880
I just want results.

109
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
These results might be good for you.

110
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,330
But as for Tongtong.

111
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,880
I don't care if you're Feng Buhai or Liu Guanying.

112
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,010
What we need to do now

113
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,060
is find a way to solve what's about to happen.

114
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,840
People have already started dying in Dengzhou.

115
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,000
Who will be next?

116
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,080
Could it be Tongtong?

117
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,720
We don't know.

118
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,050
We can't stop it either.

119
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,970
Avenging people from the past,

120
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,040
but what about those living now?

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,490
What do you mean?

122
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,480
Feng Buhai,

123
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,480
Liu Guanying,

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,730
and why has your voice changed?

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,010
What do you want to know?

126
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,800
Just ask.

127
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,120
Those things Shen Hui gave me are my father's manuscripts.

128
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,160
There are some special symbols on them.

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,960
I want to know

130
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,210
if they're some kind of writing

131
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,450
or some kind of code.

132
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,410
My master instructed me

133
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,040
to escort him to Dengzhou.

134
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
During that time,

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,480
he stored some manuscripts he was carrying

136
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
at a storage facility in Qingzhou,

137
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,960
intending to retrieve them after finishing his business in Dengzhou.

138
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,820
Unexpectedly,

139
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,560
disaster struck.

140
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,680
Those manuscripts are his belongings,

141
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,770
I can only hand them over to you.

142
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,560
I haven't read the contents of the manuscripts,

143
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,890
nor do I know about those strange symbols.

144
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,260
Are there any other manuscripts?

145
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,130
I'm not sure,

146
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,800
but my master had a carriage.

147
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,960
He drove it secretly,

148
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
kept it with him,

149
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,010
never replacing it.

150
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,090
If you want to find more of his belongings,

151
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,130
they might be in that carriage.

152
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,930
Where is that carriage now?

153
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,920
When my master decided to come to Dengzhou,

154
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,450
he entrusted the carriage to two confidants.

155
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,320
They would take the carriage to where it should be.

156
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,140
As for its exact location now,

157
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
only those two confidants know.

158
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,680
You've followed my father for so many years.

159
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,940
Tell me about what happened at Huo River.

160
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,040
I was trained by my master since childhood

161
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,300
and obeyed his orders.

162
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,340
Joining Baili Yuan's Tabai Regiment

163
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,159
was also under his instruction.

164
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,159
The purpose was for me to get close to Baili Yuan

165
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,620
to monitor his movements.

166
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Four years ago,

167
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,480
after the Battle of Wusuling,

168
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,320
the rebel forces were almost completely destroyed.

169
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,720
The remaining few thousand rebels fled to the Huo River area.

170
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,280
Baili Yuan led his troops there,

171
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,120
but the rebels had already hidden in the mountains and forests.

172
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,580
Those responsible for finding these rebels

173
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,450
were mainly the Tabai Regiment I belonged to.

174
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,700
But during the span of half a year,

175
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,650
we never found any trace of the rebels.

176
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,980
Then suddenly one day,

177
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
I received a secret message from my master.

178
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,360
He informed me that the rebels

179
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,760
are hiding in a place called Sunset Valley.

180
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,980
But he doesn't want Baiyi Yuan to find these people.

181
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,610
He asked me to use my position as a Tabai

182
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,960
to prevent other Tabai from approaching that valley.

183
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
I've always just carried out orders

184
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
without asking for reasons.

185
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,560
Then one day,

186
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,610
under Feng Buhai's instructions,

187
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,840
we split up to search for the rebels.

188
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
Let's split up and search.

189
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,640
You two cross the Hu River first.

190
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,240
You can look after each other.

191
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,760
I'll go to Tiger Head Mountain.

192
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,160
We'll meet at Black Wind Valley in two days.

193
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,680
Liu Guanying and I crossed the Hu River.

194
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,320
Our search yielded nothing.

195
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,080
But I realized that going further ahead would lead us to Sunset Valley.

196
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,680
Liu Guanying would discover the rebel forces.

197
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,220
So I suggested searching in another direction.

198
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,810
But Liu Guanying insisted on moving forward.

199
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,360
We had an argument about it.

200
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,160
I'll go check over there.

201
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,680
Someone has already searched there.

202
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,480
To be safe,

203
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,240
let's check it again.

204
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,560
The military situation is urgent.

205
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,640
There's no need to waste time here.

206
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,200
How do you know it's a waste of time if we don't go?

207
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
With your rank,

208
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,160
you should follow my orders.

209
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,140
That night,

210
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
Liu Guanying waited until I fell asleep

211
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,450
and rode alone to the location.

212
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,170
Sure enough,

213
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,280
he spotted the rebels in Sunset Valley.

214
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,480
He hurried back

215
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,120
and excitedly told me everything.

216
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,620
Found them!

217
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,940
Found them!

218
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,940
To prevent him from going back to report,

219
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,130
I attracted Baili Yuan's army.

220
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,760
I had to subdue him

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,040
and tie him up.

222
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,440
However,

223
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
after he regained consciousness, he broke free and escaped.

224
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,250
I chased him all the way.

225
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,620
Until I met you in Heifeng Valley.

226
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,840
With no other choice,

227
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,560
I had to kill him in front of you.

228
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,700
I didn't return to Baili Yuan's army,

229
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,810
but went to meet up with my master instead.

230
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,450
My master took me to Sunset Valley.

231
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,360
I saw that

232
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,040
floating city in the sky

233
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,530
and thousands of rebels below.

234
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,920
They all died unnaturally.

235
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,040
My master told me

236
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,690
it was him who

237
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,360
poisoned the spring water they drank.

238
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,520
When I learned that my master killed those rebels,

239
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,380
my reaction was similar to yours.

240
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,080
But I never asked him why he did it.

241
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,180
My father dug tunnels in Dengzhou

242
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,010
planning to flood the entire city.

243
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,010
Did you know about this?

244
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,640
It seems you didn't know.

245
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
You escorted my father to Dengzhou,

246
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,460
claiming it was under his orders.

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,130
Why would he do that?

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,730
I don't know.

249
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,840
What are you all talking about?

250
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,760
I don't understand anything you've been saying.

251
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Who are Feng Buhai and Liu Guanying?

252
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,520
Are you Feng Buhai?

253
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,400
But why are you also called Liu Guanying?

254
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,730
Didn't you just say Liu Guanying was dead?

255
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,260
You just promised.

256
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,900
You said you wouldn't kill her if she talked.

257
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
I never promised.

258
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,920
That was implied consent.

259
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,360
Your silence was consent.

260
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,560
You can't go back on your word like that.

261
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,080
You said

262
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,820
you needed to prevent something terrible from happening.

263
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Although she didn't give a direct answer,

264
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,560
it wasn't completely useless.

265
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
I figured it out.

266
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,160
Doesn't Cao Jiande have a carriage?

267
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,480
Find that carriage

268
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
and you might find your answers.

269
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,480
And another thing,

270
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,800
you asked me to save her.

271
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I went through so much trouble,

272
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,280
worked hard to heal her,

273
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,600
and now you want to kill her?

274
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,680
You wasted all my money,

275
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,160
all my effort,

276
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,360
all those medicines.

277
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,640
She even said

278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,840
you can kill her however you want after she gets her revenge.

279
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,300
Look at her condition now.

280
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
Who knows how long she'll live.

281
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,680
You'll get your revenge eventually.

282
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,410
Can't you wait a little longer?

283
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm thinking,

284
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,120
why don't you stop staying in this shabby cellar?

285
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,760
It's not good for your recovery.

286
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,040
Come on, let's go to my place,

287
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,500
back to my Qingfeng Tower.

288
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,280
No need.

289
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,280
You're seriously injured, don't push yourself.

290
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,920
It'll be easier to treat you at my place.

291
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,450
I didn't ask you to treat me.

292
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
You're my patient now.

293
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,640
If something happens to you out there,

294
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,770
would they say I killed you or you died from your illness?

295
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,640
Lin Han.

296
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,200
Wait.

297
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,660
Come here for a second.

298
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,360
Did you take these things from Wuji Temple?

299
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,360
Yes.

300
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,650
The men in black who attacked us by the lake

301
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,970
were in that temple.

302
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,900
The armored man was there too.

303
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,120
Did you set fire to Wuji Temple?

304
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,360
Zeng Xin was being held captive there.

305
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,690
We needed to rescue him.

306
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
You were there too

307
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,520
because

308
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,920
Lin Han went looking for the armored man

309
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,050
and you rescued her.

310
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,360
These things,

311
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,880
where exactly did you find them in Wuji Temple?

312
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,340
I found them on a young man.

313
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,240
He seemed to be their leader.

314
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,890
Do you know what this symbol means?

315
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,220
It probably represents some organization.

316
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,290
This is the emblem of Zouwu Institute.

317
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,280
Nine years ago, during the rebellion in the Northwest,

318
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,120
I had just joined the army.

319
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
I went with Baili Yuan to suppress the rebellion.

320
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,800
By chance,

321
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,280
I killed a rebel leader

322
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,680
and made a name for myself.

323
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,080
One day, my commander took me to his tent.

324
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,440
Inside were two men dressed as civil officials.

325
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,640
The commander told me

326
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,920
that I would be under their command from then on.

327
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,400
Later I found out those two men

328
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
belonged to a secret organization

329
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,200
called the Zouwu Institute.

330
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Similar to the Imperial City Guard,

331
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,800
they mainly gathered intelligence and carried out arrests and assassinations.

332
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,560
Compared to the Imperial City Guard though,

333
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,089
it was much more secretive.

334
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,240
Are you saying those people in the temple

335
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,640
are all from the Zouwu Institute?

336
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
That's unlikely.

337
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,640
The Zouwu Institute was disbanded six years ago.

338
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,920
That's why I returned to Baili Yuan's army.

339
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,560
These must be remnants from the Zouwu Institute.

340
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
I just don't know how the people in the temple got them.

341
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,880
When you were at the Zouwu Institute,

342
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,160
hadn't you seen these before?

343
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,680
No.

344
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,080
The Zouwu Institute was divided into five divisions.

345
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,200
Each division operated independently

346
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,330
and didn't interfere with each other.

347
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,540
Then what about this seal?

348
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,890
What does it represent?

349
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,400
It should be the personal seal of the Zouwu Institute's director.

350
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,120
I see.

351
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,360
The director was the highest authority in the Zouwu Institute.

352
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,440
Extremely mysterious.

353
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
No one knew his name

354
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,280
or what he looked like.

355
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,000
Many orders were issued directly through his personal seal.

356
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,840
For those of us who carried out missions,

357
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,970
our rank was too low,

358
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,640
so we couldn't possibly know who he was.

359
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,570
This is also my first time seeing this personal seal.

360
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,960
According to these files, we can learn that

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,240
23 years ago when the mirage first appeared at Gaomeng Lake,

362
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,640
the Zouwu Institute had already conducted a thorough investigation.

363
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,900
Why would they do that?

364
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,760
About the secrets behind the mirage,

365
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,020
how much did they know?

366
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,560
For those people in the temple to get these files,

367
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,600
they must have some connection to the Zouwu Institute.

368
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Indeed.

369
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,650
Who are they really?

370
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,580
Why did they capture Zeng Xin?

371
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,520
Aren't Zeng Qian and her brother just ordinary hunters?

372
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,050
What makes them different?

373
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,490
You should know about them,

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,460
at least better than we do.

375
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,140
You're testing me.

376
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,360
You and Yun Niang came to my house before.

377
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,880
You know I'm Ye Xiao.

378
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,810
Earlier, Zeng Qian,

379
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,480
when she thought you were Ye Xiao by the lake,

380
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,810
attacked you fiercely.

381
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,600
What exactly happened between you two?

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,260
About me being Ye Xiao,

383
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
you haven't told Zeng Qian yet, have you?

384
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,450
Why would I tell her?

385
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,570
Isn't the situation chaotic enough already?

386
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,240
But what grudge is there between you two?

387
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,480
It's not about grudges,

388
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,520
just an old story.

389
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,250
But what's in the past that can't be spoken about?

390
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,720
You can't keep secrets forever.

391
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,010
You can't keep getting burned every time.

392
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,500
I'll go talk to her now.

393
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,000
That little mouth of yours

394
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,800
is always trying to fool people.

395
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,490
Mother-in-law,

396
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,250
I'll tend to the fire later.

397
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,000
All right.

398
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
You tend the fire. I'll cook.

399
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
We're back.

400
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,240
We have guests again.

401
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,400
Guanying,

402
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,820
some friends are here.

403
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,160
Join us for dinner.

404
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,880
No thanks, Mom.

405
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,340
We'll eat when we get back.

406
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,000
Tongtong,

407
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,080
come with me for a bit.

408
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,280
Mr. Xie.

409
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,240
What is it?

410
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,380
Have you seen my young master?

411
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,720
He...

412
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,600
What are you two doing?

413
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,570
Do you still care about your young master?

414
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,320
Then tell me!

415
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,480
What happened to him?

416
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Is he in trouble?

417
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,240
There was a small issue.

418
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
But nothing serious.

419
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,100
He should be back soon.

420
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,250
You've seen him?

421
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,200
He's fine.

422
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,320
Alright.

423
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,220
I'll leave you two alone then.

424
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,860
Why is it you again?

425
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,300
You're my patient.

426
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,450
I'm your doctor.

427
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,930
Who else would it be?

428
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,490
Why can't I move?

429
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,880
This is an acupuncture technique I just learned from a book.

430
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,760
After the needles are inserted, you won't be able to move for 4 hours.

431
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
But after 4 hours,

432
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,200
I can't promise you'll be full of energy,

433
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,530
but at least you'll be able to move freely.

434
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,900
What time is it now?

435
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,380
Just past noon.

436
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,520
Take the needles out.

437
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,380
I can't do that.

438
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,320
Take them out.

439
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,920
I have things to do.

440
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,960
I just put them in.

441
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
If they're not left in for 4 hours, it will have the opposite effect.

442
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,000
You might actually be permanently paralyzed.

443
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,820
Don't be like this.

444
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,460
You really can't move now.

445
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,360
What's so urgent?

446
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,520
Can't it wait for two hours?

447
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,050
If you don't pull it out now,

448
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,520
I'll kill you after two hours.

449
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,580
Even if you kill me, I can't remove it.

450
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,880
I already can't clear myself

451
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,340
of the murder charges.

452
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,220
I don't want to be labeled as an incompetent doctor.

453
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Although I've carried that burden for over ten years.

454
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,420
Then let's do this.

455
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,360
Go do this for me.

456
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,570
I have an appointment today

457
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,640
to exchange something at Tianran Restaurant.

458
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,880
The money is in my pocket.

459
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,240
Take it there.

460
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,160
I'll go get a woman to come over.

461
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,800
No need.

462
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,320
Don't waste time.

463
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
10,000 taels.

464
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,280
I didn't know bank notes came in such large amounts.

465
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,080
This is a special privilege note.

466
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,610
What could be worth so much?

467
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,040
And that thing you want me to find,

468
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,120
I've never seen it before.

469
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,780
What if I bring back a fake one?

470
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,520
Take a hammer with you

471
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,540
and hit that thing with it.

472
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,200
If it doesn't break

473
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,740
and there's no damage to its surface,

474
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,940
then it's genuine.

475
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,840
That's amazing.

476
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,440
What does the trader look like?

477
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,370
Never seen them.

478
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,520
But both parties have agreed

479
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,240
to carry a folding fan painted with Zhou Fang's 'Court Ladies Adorning Their Hair with Flowers.'

480
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,760
Okay.

481
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,920
Wait.

482
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,880
One more thing.

483
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,040
That day when I broke into the Taoist temple,

484
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,520
my sword was knocked away by that armored stranger

485
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,120
and fell outside the courtyard wall.

486
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Go check

487
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,320
if it's still there,

488
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,520
and bring it back for me.

489
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,120
Remember,

490
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,900
it's on the southwest side of the temple.

491
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,400
Okay.

492
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,480
It's you.

493
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,200
It's you.

494
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,440
You're trying to fool people with this fake thing

495
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,300
and selling it for 100,000 taels?

496
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
Young Master Xie,

497
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,240
what a coincidence.

498
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,300
Join us for a drink?

499
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,800
No, no.

500
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,000
I have business today.

501
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,840
Young Master Xie.

502
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,400
Young Master Xie.

503
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,080
About that night you came to Qianhuo Shop to drink with us.

504
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,400
Our brother Niu hasn't said a single word.

505
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,460
Why are you so loud?

506
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,720
Thanks, brothers.

507
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,440
Let's drink another day.

508
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,120
Another time, alright?

509
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Young Master Xie.

510
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,850
Let's drink.

511
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,880
Let's go.

512
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,920
Have you figured out how to tell Zeng Qian about the grudge between you two?

513
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,280
No.

514
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,640
About the past?

515
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,700
Tell her the truth.

516
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,650
Although she might not believe it.

517
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,540
That's him.

518
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,560
That's right.

519
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,890
Let's go.

520
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,090
Where are you going?

521
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,160
Mr. Hu.

522
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,880
You want to catch the dam bomber,

523
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,280
but someone's already on it.

524
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,200
A female bounty hunter is after him.

525
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
With her martial arts skills,

526
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
if you try to steal her target,

527
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,860
you'll only get beaten up.

528
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,880
Don't make trouble for yourselves.

529
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,610
Impressive.

530
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,720
A captured criminal can still walk freely on the streets.

531
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,980
Take care of yourself.

532
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,800
Hold this.

533
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,280
All right.

534
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,520
You're 22 years old.

535
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,320
Isn't what he did the important thing?

536
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,520
Isn't how much he's worth what matters?

537
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,600
I wonder what treasure you bought with 100,000 taels.

538
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,010
Turns out it's my family heirloom.

539
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,800
What's your relationship with Gu Tingmei?

540
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,730
You sent him to steal my family heirloom, didn't you?

541
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

542
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,240
I don't know any Gu Tingmei either.

543
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
The seller.

544
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
We've never met.

545
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,500
All contact was through a middleman.

546
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,540
Otherwise,

547
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,680
there'd be no need for the fan as a recognition signal.

548
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,210
Why did you want to buy my family heirloom?

549
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,560
First,

550
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,290
I didn't know it was your family heirloom.

551
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,400
Second,

552
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,240
I wasn't buying it for myself.

553
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,370
So you were buying it for someone else.

554
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,120
Who?

555
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
Your master,

556
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,880
Cao Sheng's father,

557
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,480
Cao Jiande asked you to buy this for him, right?

558
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,640
Why does he want to buy this?

559
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,160
I never ask why when I do things.

560
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,400
Do you know that buying this

561
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,120
has caused me so much trouble?

562
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,480
No idea.

563
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,520
You!

564
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Where's my knife?

565
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
I didn't find it.

566
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,440
Tong'er.

567
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,040
It's Commander Lin.

568
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,610
Why are you here?

569
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,980
Commander Lin, I'm sorry.

570
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,060
Please excuse me for a moment.

571
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,880
What are you doing, Father?

572
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,160
How's the knife situation?

573
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,720
Sir.

574
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,920
The dishes are ready.

575
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,640
You may go.

576
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,480
What was that all about?

577
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,080
Why is Commander Lin here?

578
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,120
Father, don't worry about this.

579
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,600
It's a long story.

580
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
But Father, look.

581
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,480
What's this?

582
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,960
Found it!

583
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,300
How did you find it?

584
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,680
Thanks to your son's intelligence.

585
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,680
And with some help from my friends, of course.

586
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,360
Friends?

587
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,810
What kind of friends could you possibly have?

588
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,320
Don't tell me they're those people

589
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,800
who were released from prison the other day.

590
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,840
Let me tell you something.

591
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,760
Those people

592
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,880
all have suspicious backgrounds.

593
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
You should stay away from them.

594
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,640
Father, what do you mean 'suspicious'?

595
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,600
My friends are very capable.

596
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,930
Father, do you know?

597
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,360
There's a gang of outlaws in Wuji Temple.

598
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,640
They kidnapped my friend's brother.

599
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,200
We rescued him directly.

600
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,600
Was that fire that night

601
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,920
set by you all?

602
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,120
Where is everyone?

603
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
I've already told you.

604
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,320
We don't know anything.

605
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,660
That night,

606
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,960
we were drinking

607
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,490
when someone said Wuji Temple was on fire.

608
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,570
We rushed over there immediately.

609
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,220
Who was drinking with you?

610
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,560
Just us few.

611
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,400
No one else?

612
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,300
There wasn't anyone else.

613
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,880
That day,

614
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,480
was Xie Jingtang with you?

615
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,580
I'm done drinking.

616
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,280
How's that?

617
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,080
Can't hold your liquor anymore?

618
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,400
I can't drink now.

619
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,050
So you're not drinking.

620
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,760
Do you know how busy I've been lately?

621
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,080
Besides everyday,

622
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,160
I have to investigate these strange sudden deaths.

623
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,560
And now,

624
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,220
there's another case.

625
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,160
A family,

626
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,520
the one that performs by the river.

627
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,560
An entire family

628
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,560
suddenly disappeared without a trace.

629
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,720
I suspect

630
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,920
it might be connected to Wuji Temple.

631
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,520
But this Wuji Temple

632
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,600
has connections with the Prefect.

633
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,120
I can't do anything about it.

634
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,480
Because of this matter,

635
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I specifically sent someone to deliver a message to the Prefect.

636
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,520
Would the Prefect

637
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
even bother with you?

638
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,360
Listen to yourself.

639
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,120
You think all the money

640
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,000
your father spent all these years was for nothing?

641
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,330
I didn't hear anything.

642
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:39,960
No.

643
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,480
Sir.

644
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,760
The Prefect has replied.

645
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,720
Excellent!

646
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,600
Take it easy, Father.

647
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,560
Hurry and pack your things.

648
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,690
Get ready to go home.

649
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:52,850
Let's go.

650
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,340
Take the master back home.

651
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,100
Escort the master.

652
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
I almost forgot it.

653
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,000
The letter has arrived. Good.

654
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,640
The letter has arrived. Good.

655
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,440
Watch the step,

656
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,320
Father, be careful.

657
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,650
The master's reputation is at stake here.

658
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,680
Not bragging about your drinking capacity anymore, are you?

659
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,360
Finished throwing up?

660
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,690
Let's get home quickly.

661
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,500
Slow down, master.

662
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,570
Are you alright?

663
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,800
Do you need help getting inside?

664
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,570
Finally, they're gone.

665
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,880
My father loves drinking

666
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,000
but his health isn't good.

667
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,360
If I hadn't pretended to be drunk,

668
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,620
I'd have to drink more.

669
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
I have to say,

670
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,810
pretending to be drunk is exhausting.

671
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
This kid.

672
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,080
Master,

673
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,840
how much did you drink?

674
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,360
Five jin!

675
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,719
Five liang.

676
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,679
Five liang.

677
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,440
You two got this drunk?

678
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,440
I think this boy

679
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,179
is pretending to be drunk.

680
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,360
He must be worried that drinking too much would harm me,

681
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,600
so I just went along with it.

682
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,520
This kid.

683
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,760
The Prefect ordered me to personally

684
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,960
deliver this letter to you, Master Xie.

685
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,000
Thank you for your trouble, officer.

686
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,530
Please make arrangements.

687
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,250
Yes, sir.

688
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,219
Please.

689
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,360
I've removed the needles for you.

690
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,090
You'll be able to move shortly.

691
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,360
If you want to kill me,

692
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,280
please wait a little longer.

693
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,200
By the way,

694
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,490
these 100,000 taels...

695
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,770
I'll put it here.

696
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,760
I can't sell my family heirloom no matter what.

697
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,660
But if you'd like to see it,

698
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,340
I can show it to you.

699
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:35,960
Also,

700
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,050
I really couldn't find your knife.

701
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,480
If you're not comfortable with other weapons,

702
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,680
I can find you a good one.

703
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,800
Back when Dian and Dayin had their great battle,

704
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,760
the county office collected many items,

705
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,880
including a cannon,

706
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
and some weapons.

707
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,500
I remember there's a knife

708
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,780
very similar to yours.

709
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,250
But it's been in storage for years,

710
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,280
not sure if it's still usable,

711
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,140
might be rusty.

712
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,600
I'll get some wood ash

713
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,720
to polish it for you,

714
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,760
guarantee you'll like it.

715
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,360
No need.

716
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,800
I'm more used to my own.

717
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:05,960
Alright.

718
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,360
Did you hear that sound?

719
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,090
It's coming from the backyard.

720
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,080
Are you okay?

721
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,720
What's going on with you?

722
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,600
You're drunk.

723
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,000
Although I don't know

724
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,640
exactly what past events you want to tell her about,

725
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,500
what if Zeng Qian gets emotional?

726
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,960
Isn't it risky to bring Tongtong along?

727
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,520
But in this situation,

728
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,650
leaving her at home isn't safe either.

729
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,320
Let me put these things down.

730
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,970
What are you talking about?

731
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,000
Why isn't it safe to stay at home?

732
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,440
I'll explain it to you later.

733
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,200
I need to talk to your uncle about something.

734
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,600
Go wait in his room first.

735
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,240
Go.

736
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,360
Let's go.

737
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,530
Where did the people inside go?

738
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,260
I just saw the master and them go to the backyard.

739
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,460
Tongtong, come on.

740
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,300
You go ahead first.

741
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,920
Where's the young master?

742
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,760
He's inside.

743
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,160
Look.

744
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,720
Another one dead.

745
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,520
According to Yunniang's description,

746
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,000
this person suddenly died while walking,

747
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,860
as if attacked by someone.

748
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,360
But she said he was alone here,

749
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,620
there was nobody else.

750
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,680
I really didn't see the killer.

751
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,140
Did you not see them or could you not see them?

752
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,180
Invisibility.

753
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,200
So the Iron Man has this ability too.

754
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,040
Could he still be here?

755
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,720
That's unlikely.

756
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,440
Yunniang, do you remember?

757
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,760
When we retrieved the heirloom from the Gu family,

758
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,960
on that small street,

759
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,610
a small light suddenly appeared on it,

760
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,560
and then,

761
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,420
people started dying in the nearby shop.

762
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,170
When this person just died,

763
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
it lit up again.

764
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
And this light,

765
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,640
it moves.

766
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,560
Every time this light reaches the center position,

767
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,000
someone nearby dies.

768
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,520
After someone dies, the light starts moving toward the edge.

769
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,080
And then,

770
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,300
it disappears.

771
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,640
If the light represents the Iron Man,

772
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,560
then your heirloom can sense his position,

773
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,370
even if he's invisible.

774
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,050
That's exactly what I mean.

775
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,080
And this center point,

776
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,480
should represent,

777
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,280
our position.

778
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,680
It should be the position of the heirloom.

779
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,810
That's what I meant.

780
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,440
When this light is near the center point,

781
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,200
the Iron Man is nearby.

782
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,520
When this light starts moving toward the edge,

783
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,760
the Iron Man must be flying away.

784
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,640
If that's the case,

785
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,970
this person must also be someone who returned after disappearing.

786
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,440
Three people have died so far.

787
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,600
Three,

788
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,520
just the ones we know about.

789
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,320
You mean,

790
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,400
the other people who returned,

791
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,130
will also...

792
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,440
I don't know.

793
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,680
Look.

794
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,280
He came back and didn't know.

795
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,120
Bleeding from all orifices.

796
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,320
Although the Iron Man is difficult to deal with,

797
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,050
it's not completely hopeless.

798
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,050
As soon as the Iron Man appears,

799
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,330
a light will appear on my heirloom.

800
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,800
Once we spot the light,

801
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,520
we run.

802
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,760
Although we can't defeat the Iron Man,

803
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,490
as long as we have the heirloom,

804
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,640
we still have a chance to escape.

805
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,490
Why are you all looking at me like that?

806
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,040
Don't even think about taking my heirloom.

807
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,080
But you don't need to worry,

808
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,010
I, Xie Jingtang,

809
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,380
am not someone who lacks loyalty.

810
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,120
Although I can't give you the heirloom,

811
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,800
but,

812
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,920
you can stay with me.

813
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Why wait until we sense him before running?

814
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,240
We can leave now,

815
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,370
get out of Dengzhou.

816
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,800
It's useless.

817
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,020
How do you know?

818
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,050
I've talked with Cao Sheng.

819
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,160
Tang'er.

820
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,920
Tang'er.

821
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,400
Why are you here?

822
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,330
What's going on?

823
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,280
Look.

824
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,240
Why is it the same way of dying again?

825
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,420
This is already the fifth one.

826
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,920
Forget it.

827
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,720
Today,

828
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,800
isn't he the one you rescued from Wuji Temple?

829
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,520
That person's brother?

830
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,300
What are you doing?

831
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,320
Do you have any idea what trouble you've caused?

832
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,580
Release him immediately,

833
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,920
right now, at once!

834
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,650
Impossible.

835
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,080
Do you know what kind of people are in Wuji Temple?

836
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,920
If you don't release him,

837
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,400
we'll all be in grave danger.

838
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,440
If you dare touch my brother,

839
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
you'll be in grave danger right now.

840
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,640
Miss,

841
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,210
I'm only thinking of everyone's welfare.

842
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,600
I'm telling the truth.

843
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,280
If you don't return him,

844
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,040
we'll all suffer the consequences.

845
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,480
He's her own brother.

846
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,410
Even if he were her son, you shut up!

847
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,960
Miss,

848
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,040
please just take my advice.

849
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,440
This matter is far more complicated than you imagine.

850
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,380
If you continue like this,

851
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,960
more people will be involved.

852
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,640
Dad, that's enough.

853
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,300
You're friends with Tang'er,

854
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,080
and I'm your elder.

855
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,560
How could I harm you?

856
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,440
Take good advice and you'll prosper.

857
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,720
When under someone's roof, one must bow their head.

858
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,920
How did everyone disappear?

859
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,660
The food is still on the table.

860
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:44,960
No,

861
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,400
there are plenty of people here.

862
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,620
I'm the county magistrate, do you know that?

863
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,210
Tang'er.

864
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,120
Are you alright?

865
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,040
They didn't recognize I'm the magistrate.

866
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,880
Forget about being a magistrate.

867
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,480
They attack anyone they see.

868
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,920
Young master,

869
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,440
he's fallen asleep again.

870
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,560
Tang'er,

871
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,220
be careful!

872
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,200
Watch out!

873
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,440
Tang'er!

874
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,840
Tang'er!

875
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Dad, be careful!

876
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:34,800
Tang'er,

877
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,530
are you okay?

878
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,800
Dad!

879
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,880
Tang'er.

880
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,680
Father.

881
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,920
Father.

882
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,120
Stop playing, Father.

883
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,120
Stop playing.

884
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,480
Father.

885
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Save the Emperor!

886
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,480
Save the Emperor!

887
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,960
Greetings, Father Emperor.

888
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,280
Long live the Emperor!

889
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,520
I have come too late to save you,

890
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,980
Father, please punish me.

891
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,000
Rise.

892
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,140
Your Highness,

893
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,140
we found it.

894
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,280
Release them.
