1
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,320
My brothers brought him back here.

2
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,400
I heard that

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,800
as soon as we set off the signal flares,

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,760
he passed out.

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,650
Yunniang went to Wuji Temple in his place.

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,880
So you're back.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,560
I went to the entrance of Wuji Temple

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,160
but didn't see anyone there.

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,220
Why is Cao Sheng asleep again?

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,880
How's the situation at Wuji Temple?

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,480
There's no activity inside.

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,880
Why are only you two back?

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,060
Where are Zeng Qian and Yunniang?

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,800
Still not out yet?

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,440
Looks like we need to go to Wuji Temple.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,500
But someone needs to watch Tongtong.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,800
Leave it to me.

18
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,440
I can handle 200 or 300 people by myself.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,920
I'll do it.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,720
Feng Buhai.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,480
Let me tell you something.

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
The Prince of Jingnan isn't actually the Prince of Jingnan.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,720
He's an actor named Guo Huai.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,440
Our signal flare has been up for over two hours.

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,640
Still no sign of them.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,720
I'm afraid...

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,700
Cao Sheng's plan should have worked.

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Even if he fell asleep,

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,479
Yun Niang went in for him.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,479
Then the armored men were lured out of the temple by you.

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
They should have been able to see the Emperor directly.

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,400
The Emperor doesn't know martial arts.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,640
Either Zeng Qian or Yun Niang could easily take him down.

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
How could anything go wrong?

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,090
Is anyone there?

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,130
Come out now.

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,560
His Majesty is merciful.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,720
He won't hold this against you.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,920
But if you dare trespass again,

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,440
you will be executed without mercy.

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,100
We still have one more person.

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,480
Let go!

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
Going there now is suicide.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,800
Zeng Qian is still in there.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
You can't save her now.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,560
Let go!

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,000
If they wanted to kill Zeng Qian,

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,660
they wouldn't have let you go.

49
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,400
So Zeng Qian is safe for now.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,600
I know you're not afraid to die,

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,200
and I know how important Cao Sheng's words are to you.

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
You'll complete his plan even if it costs your life.

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,720
If you force your way in now,

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,579
you're like an egg against a rock.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,940
You won't save anyone,

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,980
and you'll lose your life too.

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,400
But if you insist on doing this,

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,370
I'll go with you.

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,940
Take care of your wound first.

60
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,860
So that's what's going on.

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,020
No wonder you two seemed strange sometimes.

62
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
So Cao Sheng has a needle in his head.

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,480
Last time when we went up the mountain,

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,880
the young master inserted this long needle

65
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,320
for the first time to buy himself more time.

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,290
He lasted for a day and a night then.

67
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,240
I was worried there would be consequences.

68
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,380
This time when he entered Wuji Temple, he used the same needle,

69
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,280
but only lasted for two hours.

70
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,290
This is the first time he's had an attack while the needle was in.

71
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,450
Before, he used the needle to keep himself awake.

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
And now look,

73
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,970
even the needle doesn't work anymore.

74
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,720
What are we going to do now?

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm afraid he'll use an even longer needle,

76
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,600
which will only make his condition worse.

77
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,610
Why did you keep this from us all this time?

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,080
We didn't mean to hide it from you.

79
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,610
The young master thought telling you wouldn't help.

80
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,200
It would only make you worry.

81
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,680
How long do you think he'll sleep this time?

82
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,120
I don't know.

83
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
It's worse than before.

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,640
What if we use a longer needle

85
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,700
Is there any chance

86
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,960
we could wake him up with pain?

87
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,159
The young master had me try that before.

88
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,460
It didn't work.

89
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,159
In this situation,

90
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,420
all we can do is wait for him to wake up naturally.

91
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,760
There's no other way.

92
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,440
Isn't that like being half dead?

93
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,380
Do you know how to talk?

94
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,040
I mean, in medical books this is called

95
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,040
catalepsy.

96
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,440
That's what medical books say.

97
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,480
What you said about the Emperor knowing martial arts

98
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,680
seems quite strange.

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,680
He caught me and Zeng Qian off guard.

100
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,600
When I woke up, I was being escorted out of the temple.

101
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,860
I didn't see Zeng Qian.

102
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,120
Why did they let you go

103
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,520
but kept Zeng Qian there?

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,400
And you said the Emperor is such a good fighter,

105
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,159
so why was he

106
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,480
so easily subdued by Cao Sheng before?

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,090
There's a possibility.

108
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,620
What possibility?

109
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,400
I'm not sure yet.

110
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,400
You can still tell me even if you're not certain, brother.

111
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,400
Zeng Qian is still at Wuji Temple,

112
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,960
and Cao Sheng remains unconscious.

113
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
Listen, Feng Buhai,

114
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,800
you're the smartest one among us,

115
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
please come up with something.

116
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,130
I have a plan.

117
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,960
What is it?

118
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,360
Wait.

119
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,840
Wait for what?

120
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,100
Wait for him to wake up.

121
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,970
I don't need you to tell me that.

122
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,880
I thought you had some solution.

123
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,610
I take back my compliments.

124
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,770
And to think I treated your arm.

125
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,690
Give me back my medicine money.

126
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,320
Forget it.

127
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,160
There's no point in wasting time like this.

128
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
I'll go back and check my medical books

129
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,210
to see if there's another way to wake Cao Sheng up.

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,799
Your wound.

131
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,679
It's nothing.

132
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,080
Mom.

133
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,050
Peeling garlic?

134
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,520
We're staying at Young Master Xie's place.

135
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
We're causing trouble for them.

136
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,840
Helping with what we can

137
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
is only right.

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
Why are you alone?

139
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,300
Where's Tongtong?

140
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,440
You took her home to fix the roof.

141
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,360
I haven't seen her for two days.

142
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
She's exhausted these days.

143
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,530
She's sleeping inside.

144
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,680
When she wakes up, tell her to come over.

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,460
I'll take her shopping for some new clothes.

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
Last time when I made her a bracelet,

147
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,980
I noticed she's grown taller.

148
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,400
I guess those clothes

149
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,660
don't fit her anymore.

150
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,490
Alright.

151
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,120
I'll send her over later.

152
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,360
Also,

153
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,440
when will our roof be fixed?

154
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,890
It's been so many days already.

155
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,170
I'm afraid you're making it worse.

156
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,840
And it's keeping you from your business.

157
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,640
We can't just sit around spending money forever.

158
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,520
Okay,

159
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,660
I understand, Mom.

160
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,940
Are you planning to keep me locked up like this forever?

161
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
You're the one keeping yourself locked up.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,460
If you leave this body, wouldn't you be free?

163
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,360
Does Aunt Ji miss me?

164
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,080
You should still call her mother-in-law.

165
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,880
Fine.

166
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,520
I'll take you to see her later.

167
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,980
I hope that in front of her,

168
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,820
you'll still be Tongtong.

169
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,120
Just like before.

170
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,400
The same as you've always been.

171
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,160
Even if you're just pretending.

172
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,490
Okay?

173
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,040
[Enter]

174
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,420
You've been keeping watch here all night, haven't you?

175
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,850
Don't worry too much about him.

176
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,120
He slept for three hours before.

177
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,680
Sleeping for a day this time should be enough.

178
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
He might wake up tonight.

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,840
Then we'll find a way to save Zeng Qian.

180
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,980
How about this?

181
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,560
I'll get you something to eat.

182
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,080
The buns from our Qingfeng Restaurant.

183
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,010
My own creation.

184
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,200
No need.

185
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
What's wrong?

186
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,250
No appetite?

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,160
They taste terrible.

188
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,920
I knew it.

189
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,970
You've been up all night again.

190
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,240
Didn't I arrange a room for you?

191
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,740
Have something to eat.

192
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,480
Remember what we agreed.

193
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,360
These buns

194
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,980
aren't from our place.

195
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,620
Feng Buhai knows you don't like them,

196
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,640
so he bought them specially from next door.

197
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,920
Thank you.

198
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,440
I've gone through all the medical books.

199
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,160
There are similar cases to his,

200
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,020
but they're not exactly the same.

201
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,440
I want to try acupuncture on him,

202
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,400
but I'm afraid I might hurt him

203
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,660
and make things worse.

204
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,410
I'm still worried about Zeng Qian,

205
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,720
wondering how she's doing alone at the Taoist temple.

206
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,880
Axin.

207
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,560
A few days ago,

208
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,760
the rabbit skin that sister skinned has disappeared.

209
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,690
Have you seen it?

210
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,480
If you went to the market and traded for something delicious

211
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,200
or fun

212
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,880
I wouldn't blame you.

213
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,680
But you can't lie to me.

214
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,760
Sister

215
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,760
I took that rabbit skin.

217
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,820
You don't like to burn mugwort

218
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,560
and you're always getting bitten by mosquitoes.

219
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,360
I wanted to trade the rabbit skin

220
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,810
for a mosquito-repellent sachet.

221
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,720
But they told me

222
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
rabbit skin isn't worth much

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,530
and wouldn't trade with me.

224
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,640
Later

225
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,480
I met someone.

226
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,920
He told me

227
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,440
mosquitoes are most afraid of this kind of stone.

228
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,080
As long as you carry it with you

229
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,540
you won't get bitten by mosquitoes anymore.

230
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,920
So I traded that skin

231
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,440
for this stone.

232
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
That person also said

233
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,160
you must rub this stone hard

234
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,090
until its surface becomes smooth for it to be effective.

235
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,320
But

236
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,760
I've been rubbing it all night

237
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,200
and it hasn't changed at all.

238
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,420
Sister,

239
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,000
just wait a bit longer.

240
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,360
If I keep rubbing until tomorrow night,

241
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,020
I'll definitely get it right.

242
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Then

243
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,440
when you carry it with you,

244
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,900
you won't get bitten by mosquitoes anymore.

245
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,680
You've already done a great job with the stone.

246
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,880
I'll wear it tonight.

247
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,560
The Emperor must have a reason for keeping her.

248
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,480
As long as Zeng Qian doesn't act impulsively,

249
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,540
she should be fine.

250
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,040
We'll use the same method to enter the temple again.

251
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,880
We were successful the night before yesterday,

252
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,680
we just didn't know the Emperor knew martial arts.

253
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,440
This time we'll be prepared.

254
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,610
He won't fall for the same trick twice.

255
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,040
The same goes for Tongtong.

256
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,100
She won't use that mechanism to call the Iron Men again.

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,720
Then why don't we

258
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,680
use her hand while she's unconscious?

259
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
Wouldn't that work?

260
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,680
I've already tried that.

261
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,599
It doesn't work.

262
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,560
So I'm thinking

263
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,119
this mechanism might not just respond to a finger.

264
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
It probably responds to intention.

265
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,359
Only when Tongtong willingly

266
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,720
calls for the Iron Man

267
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,119
will the mechanism work.

268
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,099
It's just like that carriage.

269
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
When we opened it, nothing special happened.

270
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,210
But when she opened it, it was completely different.

271
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,680
Great.

272
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,140
We're done for.

273
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Now we're completely stuck,

274
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,380
utterly helpless,

275
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,020
and totally clueless.

276
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,850
There's absolutely nothing we can do.

277
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
You know, when Cao Sheng was around,

278
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,240
everything was going smoothly.

279
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,370
Now that he's suddenly fallen,

280
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
we're going down too.

281
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,320
Sister,

282
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,320
you're awake.

283
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,240
Or haven't you slept yet?

284
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,740
Are you hungry?

285
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I'll have someone

286
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,880
bring you something to eat.

287
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,340
Don't act like my brother.

288
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,680
It makes me sick.

289
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,640
I am Axin, sister.

290
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,280
At the inn,

291
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,920
you told me many stories about the past.

292
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,040
Look,

293
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm still wearing the bone whistle you gave me.

294
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,740
Cao Sheng hasn't woken up yet.

295
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,880
Not yet.

296
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,720
Without him now,

297
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
nobody knows what to do.

298
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,840
We can't just keep waiting like this.

299
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,480
What if he keeps sleeping?

300
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,010
For ten days or half a month,

301
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,520
and the Emperor suddenly leaves Dengzhou.

302
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,090
If we want to save Zeng Qian,

303
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,210
we'd have to start a rebellion.

304
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,400
Forget it.

305
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,720
I'll just give him acupuncture.

306
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,860
What are you doing?

307
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
I'm going to give him acupuncture.

308
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,320
We can't wait anymore.

309
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,440
He won't wake up anyway,

310
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,570
so let's try anything that might work.

311
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,480
Who are you calling a dead horse?

312
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,240
My savior,

313
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,040
you're finally awake.

314
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,600
Sir.

315
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,220
Here, take it slow.

316
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,740
Your legs must be numb.

317
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,450
Where are Zeng Qian and Feng Buhai?

318
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,120
Feng Buhai is fine,

319
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,640
but Zeng Qian...

320
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,120
When you hunt,

321
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,620
you must understand your prey's habits.

322
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,640
The fiercer the prey,

323
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,280
the more cautious you need to be,

324
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,500
the more you need to understand them.

325
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Over time,

326
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,520
you become like them.

327
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,000
So a good hunter

328
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,960
is a beast at heart.

329
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,240
I must keep you chained up.

330
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,960
Because I know

331
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,040
you will bite.

332
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,640
You say 'I'

333
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,650
instead of 'We.'

334
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,280
Is it a habit you can't break,

335
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,600
or do you feel

336
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,410
you're not worthy of that word?

337
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,850
That's all that happened these past two days.

338
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,280
You've been unconscious

339
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,960
and we didn't know what to do.

340
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,520
So it seems

341
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,480
the soul in Zeng Xin's body definitely isn't the Emperor.

342
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,280
But rather

343
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,180
the Prince of Jingnan.

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,200
I was going to give you more hints.

345
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,900
I didn't expect

346
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,010
you'd figure it out so quickly.

347
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,490
You not only know martial arts,

348
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,650
but you're also very skilled at it.

349
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,170
So you definitely aren't the Emperor.

350
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,920
This fact

351
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
even the Crown Prince doesn't know, right?

352
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,760
Last time when we broke into Wuji Temple,

353
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,200
we subdued you easily.

354
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
You didn't fight back

355
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,080
because you were cautious about something.

356
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,440
But you weren't cautious about me and Cao Sheng,

357
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,970
but about the Crown Prince.

358
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,060
At that moment,

359
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,420
you must have wanted to attack me.

360
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,400
But the Crown Prince suddenly appeared,

361
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,200
so you had to hide your true self.

362
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,000
Since the Emperor doesn't know martial arts,

363
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
if you had made a move,

364
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,680
you would have exposed yourself in front of him.

365
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,040
When Cao Sheng subdued you,

366
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,970
you must have been very reluctant.

367
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
But you had no choice.

368
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,480
Later at the inn,

369
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,960
there were too many people around,

370
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,040
so you could only wait for the Crown Prince to rescue you

371
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,170
and didn't dare to make any rash moves.

372
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,440
But who exactly are you really?

373
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,680
This secret

374
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,450
perhaps only the Iron Armor Man knows.

375
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,970
Without him,

376
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,920
your soul couldn't have entered this body,

377
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,760
and you wouldn't have been able to convince the Crown Prince

378
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,490
and all those court officials.

379
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,490
According to the Crown Prince,

380
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,240
the Iron Armor Man was initially working with the Emperor.

381
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,970
Why would he betray the Emperor

382
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
and choose to work with you instead?

383
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,560
Of course,

384
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,250
there's another possibility.

385
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,450
That the Iron Armor Man was working with you from the beginning.

386
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
It was you

387
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,980
who placed him by the Emperor's side.

388
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,640
But regardless of which possibility is true,

389
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,570
it shows that you have enough power

390
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
to rival the Emperor.

391
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Such people

392
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,770
there are only two in the entire world.

393
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,320
One is the Prince of Jingnan,

394
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,850
and the other is Baili Yuan.

395
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,200
At Yangjialing,

396
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,120
the Prince of Jingnan was mysteriously killed,

397
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,880
and the Crown Prince was framed.

398
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,600
The Crown Prince killed the Prince of Jingnan.

399
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,130
I was wondering at the time,

400
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,320
if this was truly the Emperor's plan to kill two birds with one stone,

401
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,640
it seemed too risky.

402
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,720
But how could the Emperor be sure that after killing the Prince of Jingnan,

403
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,980
his followers would definitely submit?

404
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,080
Instead of rebelling

405
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,760
or

406
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,890
siding with Baili Yuan.

407
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Now it seems

408
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,040
it's not that you didn't anticipate this,

409
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
but that you had enough confidence.

410
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,880
So far.

411
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,200
First,

412
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,360
you know martial arts.

413
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,820
Second,

414
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,760
your power rivals the emperor's.

415
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,280
Third,

416
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,760
Who has the confidence to suppress the King of Jing South's forces?

417
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,490
Besides you,

418
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,040
who else?

419
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,900
King of Jing South.

420
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,320
So this is what you meant by one possibility?

421
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,560
Why didn't you tell us then?

422
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,400
Didn't I tell you I wasn't certain?

423
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,200
Besides,

424
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,640
it wouldn't have helped anyway.

425
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,450
According to the clues obtained by Lin Han and Xie Jingtang,

426
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,610
the King of Jing South who was killed at Yangjia Ridge

427
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,040
was likely the actor Guo Huai.

428
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,480
Let's assume

429
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,520
that Guo Huai's soul accidentally entered the King of Jing South's body.

430
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,080
He wouldn't dare to impersonate the King of Jing South,

431
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,340
such a treasonous act.

432
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,730
Even if he dared,

433
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,480
If he wants to avoid showing any flaws in front of the Emperor and Crown Prince,

434
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,080
besides mimicking his behavior and mannerisms,

435
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,340
he must also know many details about the Prince of Jingnan.

436
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,800
So the one behind all this,

437
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,570
can only be the Prince of Jingnan himself.

438
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,880
To ensure Guo Huai's absolute obedience,

439
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,840
the best method

440
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,970
is to threaten the lives of his entire family.

441
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,400
That's why his family has disappeared.

442
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,720
Later, the mirage disappeared

443
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,050
and everyone returned.

444
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,060
But Guo Huai didn't come back.

445
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,760
The next day.

446
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,440
Their family members

447
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,760
have also mysteriously disappeared.

448
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,320
Guo Huai's soul is in the King of Jingnan's body,

449
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,880
while Guo Huai's physical body has been abandoned.

450
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,210
So where did the King of Jingnan's soul go?

451
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,000
We need to figure out the key to this matter.

452
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,200
Why did the King of Jingnan make Guo Huai impersonate him?

453
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,320
The King of Jingnan with Guo Huai's soul

454
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,140
is actually just a puppet.

455
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,560
What's the purpose of a puppet?

456
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,920
It's to be used

457
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,090
as a sacrifice when needed.

458
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,200
That's why Yangjialing exists.

459
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,720
The King of Jingnan died mysteriously

460
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,520
and the Crown Prince was framed.

461
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,760
If the real King of Jingnan was behind all this...

462
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,440
Then the one who sent people to gather at the foot of the mountain

463
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,170
was also him.

464
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,240
But these people were clearly sent by the Emperor.

465
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,800
Judging by their attire,

466
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,000
they look like people from Wuji Temple.

467
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,520
So the King of Jingnan

468
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,320
must be the Emperor himself.

469
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,360
The smarter a girl is,

470
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,800
the more attractive she becomes,

471
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,240
and the more frightening she is.

472
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,970
You don't know what fear is yet.

473
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,600
But you will.

474
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
Can't you be gentler with me,

475
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,880
like you were at the inn?

476
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,290
Everything you just said is right,

477
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,600
except for one thing.

478
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,280
At the inn,

479
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,480
I wasn't afraid to make a move.

480
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,120
Rather, during those two days with you,

481
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,080
I truly experienced Axin's happiness.

482
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,240
From now on, I'm here for you.

483
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,560
No one will ever bully you again.

484
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This bone whistle is yours now.

485
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,290
If you need anything, just blow it,

486
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,360
and I'll come.

487
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,320
I even envy him a little.

488
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,240
And

489
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,040
I actually hope that the Crown Prince

490
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,170
will find me later rather than sooner.

491
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,290
That day at Qingfeng Tower,

492
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,060
I fell down on purpose.

493
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,120
I knew you would catch me for sure.

494
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,380
Help! Save the prince!

495
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,700
But I didn't expect

496
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,900
that the prince's cry for help

497
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,400
would expose me.

498
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,840
Now before you,

499
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,000
I can also be your Axin.

500
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,200
Though I'm smarter than him,

501
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,800
if you prefer how he used to be,

502
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,570
I can be that way too.

503
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
After all,

504
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,440
this is still the same body,

505
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,800
and my soul still recognizes you as his sister.

506
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,760
I've been extremely patient with what you all did afterward,

507
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,090
sparing you many times.

508
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,970
Doesn't such tolerance

509
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
prove my sincerity?

510
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,840
You'll no longer be some lowly hunter

511
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,920
or a ghost writer anymore.

512
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,240
You are the emperor's sister,

513
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,280
his own sister.

514
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,200
Fine clothes, exquisite food,

515
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
glory and wealth.

516
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,920
What's not to like?

517
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,680
Yes.

518
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,400
Such a great temptation,

519
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,700
no one should be able to resist it.

520
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,320
Too bad.

521
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,420
All these things you offer me,

522
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
I don't like them.

523
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,440
You just said it yourself,

524
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,240
I am a beast.

525
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,930
Beasts don't understand such things.

526
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,530
Even if you're the emperor,

527
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,040
if you reach into a wolf's den for its cubs,

528
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,440
you'll still get bitten.

529
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,240
It's their nature,

530
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,900
no one can change that.

531
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,960
If a wolf becomes a dog,

532
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
don't be happy.

533
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,880
Be careful.

534
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,200
I have plenty of dogs.

535
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,000
I prefer wolves.

536
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,160
So according to this,

537
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,600
the King of Jingnan was the one who captured Guo Huai's family.

538
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,080
And my father was investigating this disappearance case.

539
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,240
So the one who killed him

540
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,770
must be the King of Jingnan.

541
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,530
That's perfect.

542
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,020
Let's go rescue Zeng Qian.

543
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,000
And kill this fake emperor, the King of Jingnan, while we're at it.

544
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,600
Cao Sheng,

545
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,700
what do you think we should do?

546
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,800
Right now,

547
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,440
I really don't have a solution.

548
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,680
We now know the emperor's secret,

549
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,200
oh no,

550
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,680
the King of Jingnan's secret.

551
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,880
We can blackmail him.

552
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,680
If he doesn't release Zeng Qian,

553
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,010
we'll make this secret known to everyone.

554
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,090
We don't have any actual evidence.

555
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,360
Who would believe us?

556
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,450
When facing adversity,

557
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,080
there's always a way out.

558
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,780
We'll find a solution.

559
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,800
Let me think.

560
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,200
Fine.

561
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
You just woke up too.

562
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,820
Take it easy first.

563
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,040
Feng Buhai.

564
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,200
Your arm needs a new bandage.

565
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,530
You're hurt.

566
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,760
It's nothing.

567
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,860
Just a minor wound.

568
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,320
It seems Yun Niang left something out just now.

569
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,760
I know it was wrong of me to cut him.

570
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:41,880
But...

571
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,210
He shouldn't have stopped me then.

572
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,400
If he hadn't stopped you,

573
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,280
you'd probably be dead already.

574
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,850
At least I would know why I died.

575
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,000
Yun Niang.

576
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
I hope you know why you should live.

577
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,040
Why to live...

578
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,280
I'm not afraid of death.

579
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,880
I know.

580
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,970
You're not afraid of dying.

581
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,040
It's because you don't yet understand the meaning of life.

582
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,440
Feng Buhai told me the same thing.

583
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,840
They say I don't know the meaning of life.

584
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,920
But in fact, such questions

585
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,600
I have never thought about.

586
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,680
My childhood experience was extremely similar to Lin Han's.

587
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,940
I was also saved by the master.

588
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,800
And trained at the same mountain villa.

589
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,960
But the difference was,

590
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,800
When I was 14,

591
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,260
the master also ordered me to kill a group of people.

592
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,280
But he wouldn't let me ask why.

593
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,440
So I played a little trick.

594
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,160
I investigated in advance.

595
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
Then I found out those people ran an illegal business

596
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,400
specifically to rob and murder.

597
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,600
But actually only a few leaders were evil,

598
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,160
the rest were coerced.

599
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,240
So I killed only those leaders.

600
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,560
I let the others go.

601
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,160
When I returned to report,

602
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,280
the master asked why I didn't kill them all.

603
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,560
I told him the reason.

604
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,040
He sighed.

605
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,240
Said I couldn't become the person he wanted.

606
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,960
He was disappointed.

607
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,960
I was sad too.

608
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,840
I promised him

609
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,170
that I would do everything as he said from then on.

610
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,920
But he never gave me another chance.

611
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,960
Later he assigned me to your side

612
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,640
to protect your safety.

613
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,640
I swear.

614
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,560
I will do anything you ask me to do.

615
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,120
I must complete it at all costs.

616
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,240
I don't want to disappoint you too.

617
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,960
This must be the meaning of my existence.

618
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Is there something wrong with that?

619
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,360
Lin Han did the same thing as you,

620
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
but with different results.

621
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,480
This proves that you two were never meant to be on the same path.

622
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,880
And you should be grateful

623
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,440
that you didn't become

624
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,640
the person my father wanted you to be.

625
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,840
Yunniang.

626
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,780
No matter what my father told you before,

627
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,360
I want you to remember.

628
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,080
Your life

629
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,920
is more important than anything else.

630
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,400
And also,

631
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,000
If one day I'm gone,

632
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,810
you don't need to avenge me.

633
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,610
I don't want you to follow in Lin Han's footsteps.

634
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,770
When did you wake up?

635
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:39,760
Bao.

636
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,199
That person you asked me to find in Maozhou,

637
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,120
I've found him.

638
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,920
And also,

639
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,120
I've had my men bring him to you already.

640
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,420
Where is he now?

641
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,040
Fu.

642
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,280
I remember when I was little,

643
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,199
my father had a friend.

644
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,460
He would visit our home from time to time.

645
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,060
Until I was 8 years old,

646
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
when he seemed to have a fight with my father.

647
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,360
They never kept in touch after that.

648
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,960
I don't think I've seen that person ever again.

649
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,000
The person you're talking about

650
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,600
must be He Xiguang.

651
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,180
He's now working as an advisor at General Bai Liyuan's residence.

652
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,200
That must be him.

653
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,560
What was the reason

654
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,840
for his argument with my father?

655
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,640
As for the specific reason,

656
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,450
this old servant doesn't really know.

657
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,680
I heard the sound of cups breaking inside the room,

658
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,280
so I hurried over.

659
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,200
Since the master didn't call for me,

660
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
I didn't dare to rush in.

661
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
I vaguely heard He Xiguang

662
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,100
seemed to be asking the master

663
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,610
for some kind of ore.

664
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,290
The master refused.

665
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,840
He Xiguang said,

666
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,040
'From now on, we are no longer friends,

667
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,240
only enemies.'

668
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,360
Then they hurried away.

669
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,880
For you,

670
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,680
the most important thing

671
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,320
should be the ore, right?

672
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,400
That's why I need your help.

673
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,120
By the way, young master,

674
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,650
Master said he would come to Dengzhou before,

675
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,540
and told me to wait in Maozhou,

676
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,840
but why is there no news at all?

677
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,200
Where is

678
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,000
the master now?

679
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,480
I'm sorry.

680
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,560
Is this

681
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,560
your only reaction?

682
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,020
What reaction do you want from me?

683
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,440
You're brave.

684
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,970
That's good.

685
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,720
But sometimes

686
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,440
you shouldn't be blindly brave.

687
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,400
By the way,

688
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,120
here's your handkerchief back.

689
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,780
I washed it,

690
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
but there's a spot I couldn't clean.

691
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,880
Which part?

692
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,530
The rooster's tail.

693
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,040
This is a phoenix.

694
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,320
A phoenix!

695
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,960
What's going on here?

696
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Listen, Feng Buhai,

697
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,690
you're something else.

698
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
Lin Han is standing guard for your Tongtong,

699
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,090
holding a knife outside your door,

700
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,400
and you're treating her like a door god?

701
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,570
I've figured out how to save Zeng Qian.

702
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,320
How?

703
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Go to Wuji Temple.

704
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,840
Just us few people?

705
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,360
Just me alone.

706
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,410
The Emperor wants to see me.

707
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,370
Tell him five words.

708
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,780
Then he will see me.

709
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,160
He Xiguang.

710
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,000
Ore.

711
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
My sister looks great in this color.

712
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,850
Why do you look so ugly in it?

713
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,760
Does she look good in this color?

714
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,000
You can ask her yourself.

715
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
He Xiguang.

716
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,120
Ore.

717
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,400
These words may get you in.

718
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,960
But they won't necessarily get you out.

719
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,080
I'm not leaving.

720
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,080
How can I help you eliminate He Xiguang?

721
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,460
Straight to the point.

722
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,680
Simple and direct.

723
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,760
I like it.

724
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,530
Your bargaining chip is clear.

725
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,620
And your terms?

726
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,050
Release the person.

727
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,640
Those two words are quite decisive.

728
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,480
It's as if

729
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,680
you've already eliminated He Xiguang.

730
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,640
I was going to say eliminating He Xiguang requires her help.

731
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,370
But you would certainly say...

732
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,680
That's a weak excuse.

733
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,320
Let me be straightforward.

734
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,640
Today,

735
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,450
either you let both of us go,

736
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,980
and we'll help you eliminate He Xiguang.

737
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,360
Or you kill me now,

738
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,300
and keep her locked up.

739
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
But if you do that,

740
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,360
you'll never get an opportunity like this again.

741
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,690
That's not how you ask someone for a favor.

742
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,460
I'm not asking for a favor.

743
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,400
This is a deal.

744
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,800
You let her go,

745
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,900
I stay here.

746
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,880
I'll tell you my plan.

747
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,570
If you don't like it,

748
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,760
kill me.

749
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,540
Killing you would be easy,

750
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,740
but getting her back would be difficult.

751
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,100
It might be difficult.

752
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,420
But thinking about it, it shouldn't be too hard.

753
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,890
You'll come back for me.

754
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,570
After all, I'm Axin.

755
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,760
Right, sis?

756
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,090
I'll wait for you so we can leave together.

757
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,640
It's okay.

758
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
I can make it back.

759
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:12,970
Trust me.

760
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,640
Sister.

761
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,340
I'm about to unlock it for you.

762
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,920
Please don't bite me.

763
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,040
If you can't bite through,

764
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,370
that would be a problem.

765
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,130
You'll definitely be fine.

766
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,370
But I will definitely kill him.

767
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Sister.

768
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,920
Don't forget your knife.

769
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,800
Escort my sister out safely.

770
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,360
Sister.

771
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,370
You met her at Qingfeng Tower, didn't you?

772
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,970
The Crown Prince's confidant.

773
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,180
Turns out to be your secret agent.

774
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,440
Could it be that the Crown Prince is in trouble?

775
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,720
Did she defect to me?

776
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Someone like you.

777
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,800
Would you ever trust a defector?

778
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,680
Sister.

779
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,480
You're so clever.

780
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,960
I told you.

781
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,840
Don't be like my brother.

782
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
I have a question.

783
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,520
You and Baili Yuan are sworn enemies.

784
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,800
Yet you only brought these few people to Dengzhou.

785
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,860
Why hasn't he made a move against you?

786
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,170
He doesn't dare.

787
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,980
If he pushes me too far,

788
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,600
I have an ace up my sleeve.

789
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,120
Since it's my trump card,

790
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,400
you don't actually think I'd tell you about it, do you?

791
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,610
Tell me about your plan.

792
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,560
No rush.

793
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,840
I'd still like to know the whole story.

794
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,160
I thought you knew quite a lot.

795
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,940
Turns out you're completely in the dark.

796
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,040
You only know five characters,

797
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,170
yet you want to extract all my secrets.

798
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,960
Your appetite

799
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,240
is a bit too big, don't you think?

800
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,360
Knowing too many of other people's secrets

801
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,800
never ends well.

802
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,940
Before coming here today,

803
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,060
I already prepared for the worst.

804
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,080
You can feel free to tell me some things.

805
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,200
If I can help,

806
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,800
that's good. If not, so be it.

807
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,930
If I can't be of help,

808
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,840
no matter how many secrets there are,

809
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,300
I won't be able to take them out of here today.

810
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,360
Then let me see

811
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,770
what you want to ask.

812
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,040
About me being the King of Jingnan,

813
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,880
you must have already guessed it.

814
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,880
We can skip that.

815
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,970
Since it's just a guess,

816
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,900
I'd like to get confirmation.

817
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,800
You arranged for the Iron Armor Man to meet the Emperor,

818
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,840
promising to help him regain his youth.

819
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,560
Afterward, the Iron Armor Man secretly killed the Emperor.

820
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,520
He claimed his soul was transferred into Zeng Xin's body,

821
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,650
but the soul actually inside this body

822
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,560
is yours,

823
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,370
isn't it?

824
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,840
But how did you manage

825
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,000
to convince the Crown Prince and all those court officials

826
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,600
without raising any suspicion,

827
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,660
making them completely believe you?

828
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,380
My father was very clever.

829
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,440
When he learned that the so-called rejuvenation

830
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,040
meant transferring his soul

831
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
into someone else's body,

832
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,960
he gave the Crown Prince and those ministers

833
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,760
each a different secret phrase.

834
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,360
The purpose is to verify

835
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,280
whether the soul in that body

836
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,400
is real or fake.

837
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,410
If even one code phrase doesn't match,

838
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
it means the soul in that person

839
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,720
isn't him.

840
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,370
The Emperor's plan sounds foolproof.

841
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,880
How did you get around it?

842
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,240
Did the Iron Man help you?

843
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,720
That's right.

844
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,280
If he can transfer souls,

845
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,080
then stealing some so-called secret codes

846
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,560
would be child's play.

847
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,680
So,

848
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,080
when I appeared before the Crown Prince and those officials,

849
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,330
I answered everything perfectly.

850
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,200
However,

851
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,560
did my father really never consider

852
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,220
that the Iron Man might be plotting against him?

853
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,200
After all, he sat firmly on the throne for over 40 years,

854
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,660
incredibly intelligent.

855
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,720
It's not that he didn't think of it.

856
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,250
He was at the end of his rope.

857
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,120
He had no choice,

858
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,280
no options left.

859
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,520
Do you think this world is fair?

860
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,040
It's not fair.

861
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,600
Some are born into wealth and nobility,

862
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
others into poverty and lowliness.

863
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,640
But then again,

864
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,560
is the world really unfair?

865
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,000
It is fair too.

866
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,680
Whether noble or humble,

867
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,410
time treats everyone equally.

868
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,040
Even the most powerful ruler

869
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,200
cannot fight against the flow of time.

870
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,530
'Long live the Emperor'

871
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
is nothing but empty words.

872
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,520
You sacrifice lives to extend your own,

873
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,560
which is ultimately unfair.

874
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,440
To consolidate all power,

875
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,640
you couldn't let the Crown Prince live.

876
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,640
And Guo Huai, who was impersonating the Prince of Jingnan, had to be eliminated too,

877
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,300
which led to that performance

878
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,650
at Yangjialing.

879
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,120
Once Guo Huai's Prince of Jingnan died,

880
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,160
his family was no longer useful,

881
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,540
so you silenced them all, didn't you?

882
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,980
What about Xie Kui?

883
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,580
What secret of yours did he discover?

884
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,360
Xie Kui...

885
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,160
His mistake was that letter he wrote to the Prefect.

886
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,920
My arrival in Dengzhou was supposed to be confidential.

887
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,640
One day,

888
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,400
my spy in the prefecture suddenly informed me

889
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,060
that the Prefect somehow knew I was in Dengzhou.

890
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,000
I was baffled.

891
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,080
After investigating,

892
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,200
I learned that the Iron Man had told me

893
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,000
the mirage would appear at Mirror Lake,

894
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,050
so I went to check it out.

895
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,160
I didn't expect the Mirror Lake dock was under repair,

896
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,690
and a carpenter spotted me.

897
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,840
Although I left quickly,

898
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,680
he still recognized me.

899
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,640
That carpenter

900
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,560
had previously been recruited to work in the palace

901
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,560
and knew who I was.

902
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,200
I don't know what he was thinking,

903
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,720
but he assumed I was in Dengzhou on an imperial inspection in disguise.

904
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,800
It's also because Xie Kui and his son

905
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,880
offended too many people.

906
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,100
That carpenter hated them deeply

907
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,370
but couldn't do anything about it.

908
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,640
So he wanted me to deal with them.

909
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,560
Xie Jingtang.

910
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,680
We common people can't touch you,

911
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,800
but someone will eventually put you in your place.

912
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,730
But he certainly couldn't find me,

913
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,960
so he wrote a petition to the governor.

914
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,120
He threatened the governor,

915
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,960
saying the Prince of Jingnan was in Dengzhou.

916
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,080
If the governor didn't severely punish Xie Kui and his son,

917
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,880
he would report both Xie Kui and the governor to me.

918
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,540
The mirage hadn't appeared at that time.

919
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,200
My father and the others had just arrived in Dengzhou.

920
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,680
If they found out I was also in Dengzhou,

921
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,320
my plans might be exposed.

922
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,440
So that carpenter

923
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,760
had to die.

924
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,560
The governor is an imperial official.

925
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,960
I couldn't rashly take action against him.

926
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,600
That would increase the risk of exposure.

927
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,280
I could only use threats and bribes

928
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,200
to bring him over to my side.

929
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,540
But I truly underestimated his relationship with Xie Kui.

930
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,800
Later, Xie Kui investigated the disappearance of Guo Huai's family

931
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,960
and suspected it was related to Wuji Temple.

932
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,420
So he wrote to the governor

933
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,440
asking about the situation at Wuji Temple.

934
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,400
There's another case recently.

935
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,720
That family performing opera by the river

936
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,400
suddenly disappeared without a trace.

937
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,840
I suspect it might be related to Wuji Temple.

938
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,440
I specifically sent someone to deliver a message to the Prefect.

939
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,200
My father the Emperor and the Crown Prince are at Wuji Temple.

940
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,930
The Prefect already knew this.

941
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,160
To prevent Xie Kui from acting rashly,

942
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,360
the Prefect told him about this matter.

943
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,560
He also mentioned my situation in Dengzhou to him.

944
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
At that time,

945
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,960
although my soul had already entered this body,

946
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,640
many plans were still brewing.

947
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,200
I could only use the Crown Prince

948
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,320
to silence Xie Kui.

949
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,120
But that letter still leaked out.

950
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,600
Everyone in Dengzhou knew.

951
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,040
So not only were my father and the Crown Prince in Dengzhou,

952
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,960
I was there too.

953
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,240
Do you all know

954
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,600
about the Prince of Jingnan coming to Dengzhou?

955
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,280
I have only heard some rumors in town.

956
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,440
Your Majesty ordered the Prince of Jingnan to guard the border.

957
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,800
Why would he suddenly appear here?

958
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,880
Then my body double, Guo Huai,

959
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,440
will have to make an appearance.

960
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,040
Report!

961
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,840
Your Majesty,

962
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,380
the Prince of Jingnan requests an audience.

963
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,680
Father, you came to Dengzhou in secret.

964
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,560
I was worried about your safety.

965
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,690
I've come to protect Your Majesty.

966
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,180
Later, I tried to eliminate the Crown Prince at Yangjia Ridge.

967
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,220
Unexpectedly,

968
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,370
you happened to witness it.

969
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,880
Man proposes, but God disposes.

970
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,080
Indeed.

971
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,240
I know you saved the Crown Prince.

972
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,840
I didn't pursue the matter then.

973
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,840
First, what happened had already happened.

974
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,720
Second,

975
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,320
I was doing my sister a favor.

976
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:35,920
However,

977
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,500
regarding Xie Kui's death alone,

978
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,480
it's quite ironic.

979
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,410
If Xie Kui and his son hadn't offended so many people,

980
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,000
that carpenter

981
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,000
wouldn't have written a petition to the prefect.

982
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,120
If Xie Kui hadn't suddenly changed his ways

983
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,680
and decided to be a good official,

984
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,960
he wouldn't have investigated Guo Huai's case

985
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,090
or written that letter to the prefect.

986
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,770
He wouldn't have brought death upon himself.

987
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,880
I suppose it's karma.

988
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,640
You speak of karma,

989
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,740
isn't that ironic as well?

990
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,090
I'm different from him.

991
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,500
I won't change my ways.

992
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,690
Whether one changes

993
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,360
isn't up to the person,

994
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,620
but to circumstances.

995
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,440
Your words remind me of your father, Cao Jiande.

996
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,960
Do you think he was a good man?

997
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,000
He tried to flood the entire Dengzhou City.

998
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,730
Did you know about this?

999
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,280
You seem to know already.

1000
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,840
Then what about the Huohe River incident?

1001
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,570
How much do you know about that?

1002
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,360
You didn't kill those thousands of rebels at Huohe River.

1003
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,020
They died by my father's hand.

1004
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,800
My father did this

1005
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,720
to prevent the Emperor from rejuvenating himself.

1006
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,580
That was my previous assumption.

1007
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,210
But later I learned about the otherworlders.

1008
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,610
I increasingly feel

1009
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,120
that the reasons behind this matter

1010
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,080
go beyond that.

1011
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,370
The secret of the otherworlders couldn't remain hidden after all.

1012
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,880
You all know now.

1013
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,890
Everything happened because of them.

1014
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,360
The mirage was their doing.

1015
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,970
They're the ones who truly needed to exchange souls.

1016
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,690
The Emperor and I merely took advantage of the opportunity.

1017
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,360
What Cao Jiande really wanted to stop wasn't us,

1018
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,840
but those otherworlders.

1019
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,560
Do you know what's interesting?

1020
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,520
Your father, Cao Jiande,

1021
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,280
was also an otherworlder.

1022
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,680
It seems you've already guessed some of this.

1023
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,170
I know that 23 years ago,

1024
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,170
a mirage appeared at Gaomeng Lake.

1025
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,010
He came at that time.

1026
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,120
That's right.

1027
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,480
Back then, the Emperor was wounded in battle

1028
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,920
and had a persistent high fever.

1029
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,240
It was the otherworlder, Cao Jiande,

1030
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,640
who used a miraculous medicine

1031
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,440
to save the Emperor from danger.

1032
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,040
So he quickly gained favor.

1033
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,720
Such an event occurred 23 years ago.

1034
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,400
At that time, southwestern barbarians invaded,

1035
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,840
the Emperor led the army personally,

1036
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,320
and was unexpectedly captured.

1037
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,040
Although he was rescued later,

1038
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,560
he was severely injured

1039
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,120
with a persistent high fever.

1040
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,400
But not long after,

1041
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,760
the Emperor suddenly announced to the world

1042
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,040
that he had received heaven's blessing.

1043
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,040
He had recovered.

1044
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,480
So that's what happened.

1045
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,000
There's something even more interesting.

1046
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,730
Although you habitually say you're 22 years old,

1047
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,040
in fact,

1048
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,520
you're already 24.

1049
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,520
For a while,

1050
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,600
Cao Jiande and I got along very well.

1051
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,440
He would even talk to me about trivial matters in his life.

1052
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,440
Including

1053
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,240
why your age should be calculated this way.

1054
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,160
According to our family hierarchy,

1055
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,560
you should call me uncle.

1056
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,600
Nephew.

1057
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,800
Cao Jiande came here 23 years ago.

1058
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,690
And you're 24 years old now.

1059
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,610
What does this mean?

1060
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,020
Haven't you thought about it?

1061
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,400
Judging by your reaction,

1062
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,130
you must have thought about it.

1063
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,820
Your biological father, Cao Jiande,

1064
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,840
when you were just over a year old,

1065
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,600
had his body taken over by this alien Cao Jiande.

1066
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,440
Your biological father's soul

1067
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,600
has long been gone.

1068
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,480
So,

1069
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,680
the man you've called father for over 20 years

1070
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,560
is actually

1071
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,720
the one who killed your father.

1072
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,800
How old

1073
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,600
are you?

1074
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,940
You want to know

1075
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,420
if my father is really my biological father, right?

1076
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,260
You've known all along

1077
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,540
but didn't want to face it.

1078
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,240
Today I'm

1079
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,040
just making it clear to you.

1080
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,160
Cao Jiande

1081
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,200
is both your father's killer

1082
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,060
and the man who raised you.

1083
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,280
It's quite a contradiction,

1084
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,600
and quite ironic too.

1085
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,170
It's hard to imagine

1086
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,040
how complicated your feelings will be

1087
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,850
when you think of

1088
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,040
Cao Jiande in the future.

1089
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,200
No matter who he is,

1090
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,090
knowing who you are is more important.

1091
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,520
A complicated past isn't scary.

1092
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,400
What's scary is

1093
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,200
being trapped in the past

1094
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,890
and fixated on the present.

1095
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,380
You want to drive me crazy,

1096
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,080
don't you? To see me lose my mind.

1097
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,480
I am a bit jealous of you.

1098
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,480
What makes you deserve my sister's kindness?

1099
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,940
Is she really your sister?

1100
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,770
Stop flattering yourself.

1101
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,840
You're jealous of me.

1102
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,250
But it's not just about this, is it?

1103
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,760
My father,

1104
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,040
although not my biological father,

1105
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,480
cares for me deeply

1106
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,800
and protects me with great affection.

1107
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,760
But what about your father, the old emperor?

1108
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,480
He relies on you,

1109
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,610
yet he's wary of you.

1110
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,720
He values your service,

1111
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,920
yet he restrains you.

1112
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,860
Has he ever treated you as his son?

1113
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,040
You're nothing but his

1114
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,840
tool, that's all.

1115
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:45,600
Enough.

1116
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,740
Let's not talk about this.

1117
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,720
Let's discuss the matter at hand.

1118
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,480
Otherwise,

1119
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,340
I'm afraid you won't be able to leave here today.

1120
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,440
According to what you just said,

1121
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,360
My father and you have a close relationship

1122
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,160
because

1123
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,240
My goal is the same as your father's.

1124
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,760
Since ancient times, there's been a saying that those not of our kind

1125
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,620
must have different intentions.

1126
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,200
This sounds like prejudice,

1127
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,560
but in reality,

1128
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,840
it's also true.

1129
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,560
The reality we face now

1130
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,560
is the arrival of people from beyond.

1131
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,160
They will occupy our bodies.

1132
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,600
This time it's 200 people,

1133
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,920
next time another 200.

1134
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,760
And in the future?

1135
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,560
2,000 people,

1136
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,420
20,000 people.

1137
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,930
By then, the people of our world

1138
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,480
will cease to exist.

1139
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
Replaced by people from beyond.

1140
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,640
If local rebellions can cause a nation to fall,

1141
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,360
then the arrival of these outsiders

1142
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,090
is undoubtedly a catastrophe.

1143
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,180
This matter

1144
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,570
needs someone to handle it.

1145
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,240
Therefore,

1146
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,360
I replaced my father the emperor,

1147
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,160
to centralize power

1148
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,220
for easier action.

1149
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,800
In the broader sense,

1150
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,440
it's for the sake of our nation.

1151
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,360
In the narrower sense,

1152
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,960
it's for personal survival.

1153
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Since my father is also from beyond,

1154
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,380
why would he side with you?

1155
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,040
Have you heard this story?

1156
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,080
A thief breaks into a house at night,

1157
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,970
but the house catches fire.

1158
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,720
Instead of continuing to steal,

1159
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,520
the thief helps put out the fire.

1160
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,840
This kind of thief is an exception.

1161
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,500
Similarly,

1162
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,840
there are exceptions among the outsiders too.

1163
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,520
At least,

1164
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,280
your father Cao Jiande is one.

1165
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,640
The souls of those outsiders are in the mirage.

1166
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,170
Those souls need physical bodies.

1167
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,320
But if we kill everyone under the mirage,

1168
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,800
then those souls

1169
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,160
will perish for lack of bodies to inhabit.

1170
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,560
This is why your father wanted to kill those thousands of rebels

1171
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,480
and flood Dengzhou city.

1172
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,280
There were only 200 people from the outer realm.

1173
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,560
To stop them, my father

1174
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,000
sacrificed tens of thousands of civilians.

1175
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,860
Isn't that too high a price to pay?

1176
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,280
Do you think he hadn't considered that?

1177
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,140
According to your father,

1178
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,600
the arrival of people from the outer realm would bring great calamity.

1179
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,800
But what exactly it was,

1180
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,120
he was very secretive about it

1181
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,640
and refused to reveal any details.

1182
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,440
Cao Sheng, oh Cao Sheng,

1183
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,440
you've made a terrible mistake.

1184
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,720
My father said the same thing.

1185
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,810
But from what I've seen of the outsiders in Dengzhou,

1186
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,600
they don't seem to pose any significant threat.

1187
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,720
Who knows?

1188
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,920
Anyway,

1189
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,920
since both he and I aimed

1190
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,980
to prevent the arrival of outsiders,

1191
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,280
when he poisoned the rebels back then,

1192
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,680
I handled the aftermath.

1193
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,760
We claimed publicly that I had suppressed the rebellion

1194
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,960
to cover up the truth.

1195
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,040
Our cooperation was once extremely close.

1196
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,540
Until this mirage appeared in Dengzhou,

1197
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,060
we had a disagreement.

1198
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,640
I hoped he would make an exception this time

1199
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,440
and allow the outsiders to come.

1200
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,520
Only this way

1201
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,240
could I use their soul-swapping ability

1202
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,300
to become emperor.

1203
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,720
Without shedding blood.

1204
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,720
But he disagreed,

1205
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,740
still claiming it would cause a great disaster.

1206
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,730
He attempted, like at Huohe River before,

1207
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,520
to kill everyone in Dengzhou

1208
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,620
to disrupt the outsiders' plans.

1209
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,560
But if that happened,

1210
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,820
it would certainly ruin my plans too.

1211
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,930
So you sent the Iron Man to kill him.

1212
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,140
I issued the secret order for his arrest.

1213
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,720
I only wanted the Qianji Guards to detain him.

1214
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,980
After I swapped souls,

1215
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,560
I would have set him free.

1216
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,780
I had no reason to kill him.

1217
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,130
The Iron Man who killed your father

1218
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,600
wasn't mine.

1219
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,080
Not your Iron Man?

1220
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,760
Could it be...

1221
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,560
That's right.

1222
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,840
There are two Iron Men.

1223
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,360
The first one initially followed your father,

1224
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,890
then later followed me.

1225
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,560
The other belongs to He Xiguang.

1226
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,120
The one you've been dealing with

1227
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,290
has always been his.

1228
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,000
So,

1229
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,040
when you disguised yourselves as the Iron Man to meet me,

1230
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,500
I knew you were imposters.

1231
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,080
Because my Iron Man

1232
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,560
has been by my side all along.

1233
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,360
You call him Iron Man.

1234
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,060
That name is quite straightforward.

1235
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,680
Cao Jiande told me

1236
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,440
that the language of people from beyond our world is different from ours.

1237
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,760
This kind of armored warrior

1238
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,690
is called 'Jia' in their language.

1239
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,320
It means slave warrior.

1240
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,000
Cao Jiande followed this sound

1241
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,840
and translated it into our language.

1242
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,080
He called it Jiya,

1243
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,040
meaning 'blade of the halberd.'

1244
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,570
That name is quite fitting.

1245
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,920
Speaking of Jiya,

1246
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,740
we should mention He Xiguang.

1247
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,160
Although you came here bearing his name,

1248
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,360
you probably don't know much about him.

1249
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,640
As mentioned before,

1250
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,240
among those outsiders who came from Gaomeng Lake,

1251
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,170
your father was one of the leaders.

1252
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,840
The other was He Xiguang.

1253
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,960
Their original intention in coming here

1254
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,690
was to receive more people from beyond our world.

1255
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,200
But later they went their separate ways

1256
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,320
and turned from friends into enemies.

1257
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,050
Because Cao Jiande stood against the outsiders.

1258
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,520
He Xiguang did not.

1259
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,520
He wouldn't allow Cao Jiande

1260
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,160
to sabotage the plan for the arrival of the outsiders.

1261
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:20,800
So...

1262
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,840
You're saying

1263
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,020
the Jiya who killed my father belongs to He Xiguang?

1264
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,320
This Jiya who follows you

1265
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,720
used to follow my father?

1266
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,900
Then why didn't he save my father?

1267
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,440
That's what happens when someone goes against me.

1268
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,320
Even Jiyas choose sides.

1269
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,330
I am the King of Jingnan.

1270
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,480
I can offer him more.

1271
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,560
Cao Jiande knew He Xiguang's Jiya was hunting him.

1272
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,160
He deliberately let himself be escorted to Dengzhou.

1273
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,960
Hoping my Jiya would rescue him.

1274
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,520
Once two Jiyas fight each other,

1275
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,880
they would certainly destroy each other.

1276
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,480
He tried to use this strategy

1277
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,360
to weaken both my power and He Xiguang's at the same time.

1278
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,320
Unfortunately,

1279
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,880
I didn't fall for it.

1280
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,960
What a pity.

1281
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,520
But now you're here.

1282
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,480
He Xiguang is now Baili Yuan's advisor.

1283
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,960
He Xiguang's Ji Ya.

1284
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,000
Which means it belongs to Baili Yuan now.

1285
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,660
Without my father's support,

1286
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,360
you can only remain competitive with Baili Yuan

1287
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,200
if you keep control of Ji Ya.

1288
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,740
Finally getting to the point.

1289
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,840
If you help me eliminate He Xiguang,

1290
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,480
you'll essentially be cutting off one of Baili Yuan's arms.

1291
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,740
This bargaining chip is quite tempting.

1292
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,210
After all, you can't do this yourself.

1293
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,240
Or rather,

1294
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,520
no one can know you're behind it.

1295
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,450
The Emperor is in Dengzhou.

1296
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,240
You're Baili Yuan's right-hand man.

1297
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,780
Yet you dare come here.

1298
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,800
If something goes wrong,

1299
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,760
the balance between the Emperor and Baili Yuan

1300
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,840
will be completely destroyed.

1301
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,840
The Emperor cannot possibly detect my whereabouts.

1302
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,240
Even if he does,

1303
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,280
because he's in Dengzhou,

1304
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,480
he can't easily move against me.

1305
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,160
Open confrontation

1306
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,260
would look bad.

1307
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,970
He Xiguang once said

1308
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,480
that open confrontation looks bad.

1309
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,340
You and Baili Yuan are at odds,

1310
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,260
neither can defeat the other.

1311
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,420
Mutual destruction is unnecessary.

1312
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,760
So your plan

1313
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,000
must be able to eliminate me completely.

1314
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,280
How much do you know about the ore?

1315
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,610
And how much do you know?

1316
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,400
He Xiguang once asked my father for the ore,

1317
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,700
but my father refused.

1318
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,980
So He Xiguang is still looking for it.

1319
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,490
Eliminating He Xiguang...

1320
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,800
knowing this much is enough.

1321
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,480
You're not asking about my plan anymore?

1322
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,280
I think I've already guessed it.

1323
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,200
Otherwise,

1324
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,170
I wouldn't have let my sister go so easily.

1325
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,090
Then why are you telling me so much?

1326
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,620
Because I want you to know.

1327
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,840
I'm not your enemy.

1328
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,800
He Xiguang is.

1329
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,970
You just said our chips are very tempting.

1330
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,420
Then your chips

1331
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,520
shouldn't you add some more?

1332
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,480
You're not asking me to give up

1333
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,880
this physical body, are you?

1334
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,160
Why must it be Zeng Xin?

1335
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,250
It wasn't my choice.

1336
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,600
It was Mirage.

1337
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,120
What about the Actor?

1338
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,080
The same.

1339
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,000
If the one who took over my body

1340
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,060
wasn't that actor,

1341
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,920
it would take a long time to learn to act like me.

1342
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,400
That means

1343
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,220
I couldn't appear in time.

1344
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,520
That would make the Crown Prince

1345
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,380
and those ministers suspicious.

1346
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,520
So I guess we got lucky.

1347
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,160
Now you're asking me to give up this body.

1348
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,680
That means

1349
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,680
I have to find another body.

1350
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,320
But my own body is already gone.

1351
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,320
I can't just be left as a soul.

1352
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,180
I'd become a wandering ghost.

1353
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,280
You have Jiya.

1354
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,760
You'll find a way.

1355
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,500
What we want

1356
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,100
is for the real Zeng Xin to return.

1357
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,479
So

1358
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,359
he can return Zengxin's soul to his body

1359
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,359
if we help him eliminate He Xiguang.

1360
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:36,920
If only...

1361
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,250
If He Xiguang is as important as he claims,

1362
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:43,359
how could he be so easy to kill?

1363
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,439
Even if we could kill him,

1364
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,240
would Baili Yuan let us go?

1365
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,040
Don't forget,

1366
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:51,040
the one in Zengxin's body now

1367
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,439
is the Prince of Jingnan.

1368
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,160
He killed my father.

1369
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,620
I still need to avenge him.

1370
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,960
Even if we help him eliminate He Xiguang,

1371
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,960
what if he doesn't keep his promise?

1372
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,600
No matter what,

1373
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:03,760
we're in a passive position.

1374
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,490
Better not to act than to react.

1375
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,920
If Zengxin can come back,

1376
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,410
Tongtong can come back too.

1377
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,920
Of course I want Tongtong back,

1378
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,800
I just don't agree with opposing Baili Yuan.

1379
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,840
Years ago, Guanying and I assassinated Prince Yu in Jiazhou.

1380
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,130
We were thrown into prison.

1381
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,439
Fortunately, an imperial envoy appeared in time

1382
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,160
and convicted Prince Yu's family.

1383
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,319
Only then were Guanying and I saved.

1384
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:34,800
This envoy

1385
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,120
was Baili Yuan.

1386
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,760
Perhaps you don't understand what kind of person he is.

1387
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,359
But compared to the King of Jingnan's actions,

1388
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,399
Baili Yuan is much more upright and honest.

1389
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:46,520
He

1390
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,090
shouldn't be our enemy.

1391
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,439
But He Xiguang, whom he favors,

1392
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:53,640
killed our master.

1393
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,100
He Xiguang is an outsider,

1394
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,200
and Baili Yuan is working with him.

1395
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,080
How do you explain that?

1396
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,360
I don't care what kind of person Baili Yuan is,

1397
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,840
but the King of Jingnan is definitely no good.

1398
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,800
Besides my father,

1399
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,720
there was also that carpenter

1400
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,240
and that actor's family - all killed by him.

1401
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,770
Wouldn't helping him be like aiding a tyrant?

1402
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,120
Although his whatever Jiya

1403
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,560
can help restore souls

1404
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,620
and save Zeng Xin and Tongtong for us,

1405
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,320
doesn't Baili Yuan have one too?

1406
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,240
Why don't we ask him for help instead?

1407
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,440
Baili Yuan has a Jiya,

1408
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,680
but Xin

1409
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,080
is not with him.

1410
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,100
Going against Baili Yuan,

1411
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,640
I'm afraid you'll regret it.

1412
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,360
Then who was it

1413
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,210
that sent you to protect us?

1414
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,960
The head of Zouwu Institute.

1415
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,000
Who is the head?

1416
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,090
I don't know.

1417
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,840
Those files we got back from the Crown Prince last time,

1418
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,640
they had the private seal of the Zouwu Institute's director on them.

1419
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,240
I said I didn't recognize it.

1420
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,480
So what does

1421
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,040
this seal represent?

1422
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,040
It should be the private seal of the Zouwu Institute's director.

1423
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,100
This private seal,

1424
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,290
I'm seeing it for the first time today.

1425
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,530
Actually, I wasn't telling the truth.

1426
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,580
I do recognize that private seal.

1427
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,400
It belongs to Baili Yuan.

1428
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,380
I served in Baili Yuan's personal guard.

1429
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,240
I've seen his personal seal.

1430
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,400
You mean

1431
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,850
the person who sent you to save my family back then

1432
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,160
was him?

1433
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,090
Why would he do that?

1434
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,560
I don't know.

1435
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,160
Then why did you hide this before?

1436
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,480
Because he issued a secret order,

1437
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,640
which means he didn't want others to know about it.

1438
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,480
He must have deeper reasons.

1439
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,380
Since that's the case,

1440
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,140
I couldn't reveal the secret.

1441
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,360
So Baili Yuan

1442
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,320
is your great benefactor.

1443
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,040
Not repaying his kindness is one thing,

1444
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,560
but going against him?

1445
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,600
Now I understand

1446
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,730
what it means to be caught between a rock and a hard place.

1447
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,280
What if we capture He Xiguang alive?

1448
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:00,760
First,

1449
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,040
we can negotiate with the King of Jingnan

1450
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,370
to prevent him from breaking his promise.

1451
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,480
Second,

1452
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,520
it won't cause Baili Yuan too much loss.

1453
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:33,520
Li Hongchou  Che Zhigang  Xing Dongdong

1454
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,520
