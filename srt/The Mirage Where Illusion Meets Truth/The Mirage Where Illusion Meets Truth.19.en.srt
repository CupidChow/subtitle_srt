1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,640
In the end,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,930
we still have to rely on ourselves.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,960
You're planning to go back to Dengzhou?

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,690
I don't know.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,640
It's just that staying here now has no meaning.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,320
Although going back to Dengzhou

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,980
won't solve anything either.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,280
That's true.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,680
We have no bargaining chips to negotiate with the King of Jingnan.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,810
Whether it's the map

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
or the minerals,

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,560
we can't provide either.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,920
That map,

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,640
what is it used for?

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,920
Not just the map,

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,080
there are many things we don't understand,

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,080
at best we only know bits and pieces.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,080
We only know that the mirage

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,360
is where the otherworldly beings exchange souls,

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,760
and that it can cure my illness.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,760
But we have no idea how it works.

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,640
How can such a massive city float in the sky?

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,680
Those otherworldly beings aren't from our world,

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,400
why did they come to our place?

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
And that monster,

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,360
why does it only kill the otherworldly beings?

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,840
What's the reason behind all this?

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,300
And where did it come from?

29
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,840
Tongtong, compared to other otherworldly beings,

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,970
knows more secrets.

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,360
How is she different from those otherworldly beings?

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,820
What makes her so special?

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,810
Since we entered Dengzhou,

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,080
it's like we've walked into a maze.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,690
Going around in circles inside it.

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,600
Every time we think there's hope,

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,759
but as we keep going,

38
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,680
we find it's still a dead end.

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,920
I liked playing with mazes when I was little,

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,250
the kind drawn on paper.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,360
They seemed quite easy to solve.

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,890
That's because you could see the entire maze.

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,360
But now we're inside it,

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,729
how can we possibly see the whole picture?

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,520
I can help you map out this maze.

46
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,880
Everything has a beginning.

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,160
Everything you've experienced

48
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,280
comes from our world.

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,280
What is your world really like?

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,660
Do you even need to ask?

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,079
It must be full of monsters with tails

52
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,680
crawling all over the place.

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,200
You think

54
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,720
we are monsters

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,320
because of Jiya,

56
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,079
because he has a tail.

57
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,360
Actually,

58
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,079
we look just like you,

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,160
at least we used to.

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,960
In the vast universe,

61
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,280
there are many worlds like ours.

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,280
All these worlds have rulers,

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,760
just in different forms.

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,399
The world we come from

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,839
was originally similar to yours.

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,320
Later, technology advanced rapidly,

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,980
wars became frequent,

68
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
resources depleted,

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
and the environment deteriorated.

70
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,960
People's appearances began to change.

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
Some grew tails,

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,840
others developed scales,

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,080
some lost limbs,

74
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,659
had disfigured faces,

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,460
and everyone's lifespan shortened.

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,680
The elite lived in cities in the sky

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,140
with abundant resources.

78
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,420
The lower class lived on scorched earth,

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
with ugly appearances

80
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,900
and scarce resources.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
The elite, seeking to extend their lives

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
and find better living conditions,

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,180
began searching for other habitable worlds

84
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,080
for population relocation.

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,520
Eventually,

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
we found your world.

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,320
Our two worlds are incredibly distant from each other,

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,980
farther than you can imagine.

89
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Due to technological limitations,

90
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,730
we couldn't safely transport our physical bodies here.

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,280
So we created a massive device

92
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
disguised as a city.

93
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,520
We named it

94
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,890
the City of Rebirth,

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,320
which is the mirage you've seen.

96
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,880
Through a special channel called a wormhole,

97
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
we first sent the City of Rebirth to your world.

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,580
Then we transferred our consciousness,

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,340
what you would call our souls.

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,640
Extract from the original body,

101
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,520
transmit to the City of Rebirth,

102
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,120
then select a suitable body here

103
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,900
and transfer the soul into it.

104
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,440
But there are conditions for choosing a physical body.

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,680
First, it needs to be young and healthy.

106
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,920
Second,

107
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,090
there must be precise matching in other aspects.

108
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,860
It's like your grafting technique here.

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,920
Not all crops can be grafted together randomly.

110
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,840
So we need to conduct extensive screening.

111
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,160
The City of Rebirth emits a special,

112
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,240
invisible light

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,760
that enters your minds.

114
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,490
Then it analyzes, matches,

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,850
and identifies suitable candidates.

116
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,280
But because human skulls are too thick,

117
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,100
This light cannot penetrate,

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,880
but eyes have no barrier,

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
and are closest to the brain.

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,720
So we disguised the City of Rebirth as a mirage

121
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,240
to attract your attention

122
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,720
and make you look up.

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
This light can then pass through your eyes

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,159
and enter your minds.

125
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,760
The chosen ones

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,740
will be marked and locked by the City of Rebirth.

127
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,600
Then using special techniques,

128
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
they will all be instantly teleported into the city.

129
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Then our souls will be transferred into their bodies.

130
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,760
During the soul transfer process,

131
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,080
the power needed to keep the City of Rebirth floating in the sky

132
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,440
will be diverted to the soul transfer equipment.

133
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,240
The levitation power will weaken,

134
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,200
forcing the City of Rebirth to land on the ground.

135
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,320
Once the soul transfer is complete,

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,920
the City of Rebirth can float back into the air.

137
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,280
Meanwhile,

138
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,920
because the soul transfer equipment generates intense heat when operating,

139
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,560
it requires large amounts of water for cooling.

140
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,360
That's why Mirror Lake dried up.

141
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,880
This is also why

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,660
the mirage always appears in places with abundant water sources.

143
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,000
After our souls enter their bodies,

144
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,880
their original souls will be suppressed,

145
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,640
and we take their place,

146
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,400
using these healthy bodies to extend our lives

147
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,640
and continue living in this world.

148
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
You must be wondering.

149
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,760
Why we don't transfer all souls

150
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,880
at once.

151
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,000
First, it's due to technical limitations.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The number of souls that can be transferred each time is limited.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,800
Second,

154
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,080
because the transfer channel is unstable,

155
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,400
we can only come to your world

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,240
at specific times and locations.

157
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,640
So until now,

158
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,300
we have only come three times.

159
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
The first time

160
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
was at Gaomeng Lake 23 years ago.

161
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
The second time

162
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,930
was at Huo River 4 years ago.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,960
The third time

164
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,880
is this time in Dengzhou.

165
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,140
There's another crucial reason.

166
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,120
It's the threat of that monster.

167
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
After our first group of migrants arrived here,

168
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,960
they began mysteriously dying one after another.

169
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,020
As the leader of the first migration,

170
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,810
Cao Jiande and He Xiguang conducted an investigation together

171
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,240
and discovered that the culprit was something invisible to the naked eye.

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,900
The reason for its appearance

173
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,840
begins with another matter.

174
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,120
After Cao Jiande arrived,

175
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
he found your history increasingly astonishing.

176
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,679
The people here

177
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,880
have been using tools for millions of years.

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,130
Yet your survival still mainly depends on farmland.

179
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
While we only needed tens of thousands of years

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,680
to reach heights beyond your imagination.

181
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,840
As Cao Jiande's research deepened, he discovered

182
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,400
that the reason for the different development rates of our two worlds

183
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,240
was the different degrees to which people utilized their brains.

184
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,400
Intelligence isn't determined by the heart

185
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
but by the brain.

186
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,880
If the brain has ten parts of power,

187
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,320
you can only use one part.

188
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,600
While we

189
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,330
can use nearly three parts.

190
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,210
The cause of this situation

191
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,120
is that there's something extra in your brains that we don't have.

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,400
We call it 'the lock.'

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,880
It restricts the use of your brains.

194
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,680
Twenty-three years ago,

195
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,540
when our first migrants arrived,

196
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,240
as the mirage transferred souls into your brains,

197
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,500
an accident occurred.

198
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,880
The lock in one person's mind was opened

199
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,280
and something escaped from inside.

200
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,480
This

201
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,520
is the invisible monster.

202
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,080
It specifically targets people from our world,

203
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,610
regardless of whether we've changed bodies.

204
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,440
People from our side

205
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,500
can learn about this world through the City of Rebirth.

206
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,960
They know that the monster kills our immigrants

207
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,200
back there.

208
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,840
But that's all they know.

209
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,700
They cannot intervene directly.

210
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,970
That's why none of us came over for more than a decade.

211
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,130
As the environment deteriorated on our side,

212
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,260
the elites became increasingly desperate to migrate.

213
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
Despite knowing about the monster's threat,

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
they still took the risk.

215
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,640
But...

216
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,080
The mission at Huhe River four years ago was a failure.

217
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,360
Cao Jiande changed his stance at that time

218
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,160
and parted ways with He Xiguang.

219
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,400
Cao Jiande wanted to protect this world

220
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,920
by killing those matched targets from the City of Rebirth,

221
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
specifically those thousands of rebels.

222
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,780
He prevented that migration.

223
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,720
After our souls are transported to the City of Rebirth,

224
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,120
if we don't find a match within fifteen days,

225
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,580
we automatically perish.

226
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,920
The City of Rebirth cannot relocate elsewhere at this point.

227
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,280
By killing the rebels at Huhe River, Cao Jiande

228
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,880
indirectly killed all the migrants above.

229
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,400
To eliminate Cao Jiande as an obstacle,

230
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,130
our side decided to send over a group of warriors.

231
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,240
This time,

232
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,960
it's no longer just souls,

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,170
but their physical bodies as well.

234
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,080
But this approach is extremely risky,

235
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,640
as death is highly likely during the transportation process.

236
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,560
The underclass

237
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,770
became the recruitment targets for these warriors.

238
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,410
The underclass in our place

239
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,900
live on scorched earth ruins on the surface.

240
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,760
From birth, they are fitted with neck collars.

241
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,600
Only the privileged have the authority to remove these collars.

242
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
This is one way the elite control them.

243
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,640
In that place,

244
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,960
looking up is a privilege.

245
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,890
The underclass don't have this right.

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,520
It's because after their mutation, their appearances became hideous,

247
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,720
and looking up would make the privileged uncomfortable.

248
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
When the lower class people raise their heads,

249
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
the collars they wear can detect it

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,640
and then attack them,

251
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,280
causing extreme pain.

252
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,360
The lower class people only have one chance to raise their heads in their lifetime,

253
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,760
and that's when they die.

254
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
All lower class people long to become warriors,

255
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
long to fight.

256
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,560
Because

257
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
only when they are in combat

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
are they allowed to raise their heads

259
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,260
without suffering attacks from their collars.

260
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,440
The elites selected 200 warriors from the lower class

261
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,500
to be transported.

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,860
They were called slave warriors.

263
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,720
As expected,

264
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,520
only two of them successfully arrived.

265
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
So now you understand

266
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,680
why Jiya, who serves He Xiguang,

267
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,340
has always lived in a dog cage.

268
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,160
Although they came to this world

269
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,040
and they possess the strongest abilities,

270
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,000
their status

271
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,480
remains lowly.

272
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,040
During the pursuit of Cao Jiande by two Jiya warriors,

273
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,700
one of them was won over and turned by Cao Jiande.

274
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,680
Cao Jiande removed his collar

275
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,880
and gave him freedom.

276
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,640
The other Jiya warrior insisted on completing his mission

277
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,240
and continued hunting Cao Jiande

278
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,300
while taking orders from He Xiguang.

279
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,480
These two Jiya warriors may seem to you

280
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
invulnerable to weapons and elements.

281
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,850
But they are equally threatened by monsters.

282
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,880
Especially

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,460
when the two of them are fighting each other.

284
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,760
Monsters always appear quickly

285
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
and attack them both at once.

286
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,220
This has happened several times.

287
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,440
The exact reason

288
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
remains unknown.

289
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,360
Fortunately, they had obtained a talisman

290
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,000
that could ward off monsters,

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,860
so they could escape the monster attacks unharmed.

292
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,160
This so-called amulet

293
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,170
is actually a type of stone.

294
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
Cao Jiande and He Xiguang

295
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,800
refined it from a special kind of ore.

296
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,080
They call it Qiu Stone.

297
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,960
In our world, Qiu

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,960
means shield.

299
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
Qiu Stone can ward off monsters:

300
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
The conflict between He Xiguang and Cao Jiande,

301
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,250
or rather between Baili Yuan and the King of Jingnan,

302
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,640
centers on the ore.

303
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,440
Baili Yuan and He Xiguang want to find more ore

304
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,080
to refine more Qiu Stones

305
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,800
and distribute them to all otherworldly visitors.

306
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,330
Then the monster threat can be easily solved.

307
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,720
But that kind of ore is extremely rare.

308
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,600
Even if we find it,

309
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,960
it still needs to be refined,

310
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,690
and the amount of Qiu Stone obtained is even less.

311
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,720
The King of Jingnan and Cao Jiande are also looking for the ore,

312
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,360
but their purpose isn't to refine Qiu Stone,

313
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,770
but to alter the properties of the ore,

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
which we call 'alienation.'

315
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,800
Alienated ore can no longer be refined into Qiu Stone,

316
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,080
making it impossible to fight monsters.

317
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,000
So our people won't dare to come here easily.

318
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,480
Cao Jiande is able to alienate the ore

319
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,490
by using a tool called the Alienation Vessel.

320
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,040
As for where this object came from,

321
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,300
that remains unknown.

322
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,800
However, the speed at which the Alienation Vessel transforms the ore

323
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,120
is relatively slow.

324
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,640
So Cao Jiande had been researching a method to accelerate the process,

325
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,120
and he succeeded,

326
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,060
but didn't have time to use it.

327
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,360
He died.

328
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,400
The blueprint recording the acceleration method

329
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,160
was left in the compartment of his carriage.

330
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,680
He Xiguang found it.

331
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,440
Let me show you something

332
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
I obtained inside.

333
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,850
When it comes down to it,

334
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,700
although the blueprints are important,

335
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
what's even more crucial

336
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,760
is the ore.

337
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,960
He Xiguang's falling out with your father,

338
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,640
your father's death,

339
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,960
the conflict between King of Jingnan and Baili Yuan,

340
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,620
all happened because of this.

341
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,120
These small green stones embedded here

342
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,640
are the Qiu stones.

343
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,360
In that room on the carriage,

344
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,330
you were attacked by monsters.

345
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,200
Jiya came to rescue

346
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,860
and fought with that monster.

347
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
During the fight,

348
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,000
a green ornament on his chest

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
emitted light.

350
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,520
Then the monster

351
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,480
seemed to leave the place.

352
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,920
It seems that

353
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,480
this thing can indeed repel monsters.

354
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,960
He Xiguang mentioned before

355
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
that he had something you wanted.

356
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
This is it, right?

357
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,690
Something that can save your life is definitely important.

358
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,240
That green ornament on the Iron Man's chest

359
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,040
is also a Qiu stone, right?

360
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,840
Yes.

361
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,060
Just in a different shape.

362
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
This explains

363
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,400
why among the visitors from beyond who came to Gaomeng Lake,

364
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,600
only my father and He Xiguang survived.

365
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,290
Because they had stones like this.

366
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,360
Is the King of Jingnan staying in Dengzhou without any concerns

367
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,160
because he also has one of these?

368
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,610
Cao Jiande has worked with him for so long.

369
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,970
It's not surprising

370
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
that he has this.

371
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,400
So it seems this thing isn't that rare after all.

372
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,080
At least all of you

373
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,880
have one each.

374
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,560
That depends on

375
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,440
how many years it took

376
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,170
to refine these stones.

377
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,720
This one He Xiguang gave me

378
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,770
is probably the only one

379
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,770
they could spare right now.

380
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,100
It's quite ironic.

381
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,600
These outsiders

382
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
who are nobles and officials in your place,

383
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,360
desperately wanted to come here,

384
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,490
only to become lower-class citizens.

385
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,520
They clearly have life-saving resources,

386
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,980
yet can't get their share.

387
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,360
They can only

388
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,620
wait to die one after another.

389
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,760
There's something even more ironic.

390
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,319
These monsters that kill them

391
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,520
only appeared after they arrived here.

392
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,760
We had no choice.

393
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,180
Back where we're from,

394
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,119
everyone's bodies

395
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,180
had reached their limits.

396
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,460
Just like the old emperor,

397
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,579
he knew perfectly well

398
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,160
that rejuvenation would lead to schemes against him,

399
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,880
but he had to take that risk.

400
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,920
That drawing shows the method to accelerate the Transformation Vessel.

401
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,680
And the purpose of the Transformation Vessel is to transform the ore.

402
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,740
To prevent the arrival of outsiders.

403
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,080
I understand why the King of Jingnan

404
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,210
is looking for this.

405
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,640
But why are Baili Yuan and He Xiguang also looking for it?

406
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,400
Wouldn't destroying it

407
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,600
be the safest option in their view?

408
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,280
The one who wants to preserve the blueprint

409
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,320
isn't He Xiguang,

410
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,600
but Baili Yuan.

411
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,720
He's more interested in obtaining the transformation vessel.

412
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
Otherwise, just having that blueprint

413
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,120
is useless.

414
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
The outsiders who come here

415
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
need minerals to survive.

416
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
The transformation vessel can transform minerals.

417
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,160
So as long as he masters the acceleration method of the vessel,

418
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,400
Lord Baili essentially

419
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,680
has control over these outsiders' lifeline.

420
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,120
Ensuring they won't

421
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,450
cause any trouble while they're here.

422
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
So when I asked him if he was worried

423
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
about outsiders becoming uncontrollable in the future,

424
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,880
he said

425
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,140
he had his own methods.

426
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,800
That's quite interesting.

427
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,760
This He Xiguang,

428
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,560
knowing full well why Baili Yuan wanted the blueprint,

429
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,320
still willingly gave it to him.

430
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,620
It's like having a knife in your hand.

431
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,400
If you want to gain someone's trust,

432
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,120
you must hand that knife over to them.

433
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,210
I'm telling you, you outsiders...

434
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,440
There are many fools like Wang Hu,

435
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,920
but there are also plenty of clever ones like you.

436
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,520
You're really despicable.

437
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,280
You've ruined your own world

438
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,080
and now you've come to ruin ours.

439
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Just look at this.

440
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,250
According to what you said,

441
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,480
there's no hunger in your world,

442
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,160
but something worse than hunger has appeared.

443
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,960
If Baili Yuan knows all this,

444
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,160
why does he still choose to cooperate with you,

445
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,560
using your techniques to change our world?

446
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
The end result won't be good either.

447
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,360
In that case,

448
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,640
I think the King of Jingnan isn't wrong.

449
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,600
You have a saying here

450
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,160
about learning from others' mistakes.

451
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,050
Baili Yuan believes

452
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,820
that the problems that occurred in our world

453
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,120
might be

454
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,170
avoidable in yours.

455
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,520
Is that so?

456
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,320
Why do I feel

457
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,280
that the more advanced the technology, the more problems arise?

458
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,660
It's like fighting with wooden swords versus iron swords.

459
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,680
Obviously, those with iron swords are more dangerous.

460
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,340
If there's a war in your world,

461
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,050
the destruction would be much greater than here, right?

462
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,250
My father said your arrival would bring terrible disaster.

463
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,130
What exactly is this disaster?

464
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,120
I'm not sure.

465
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,290
Perhaps it's related to that monster.

466
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,580
The mirage,

467
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
or what you call the City of Rebirth.

468
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,100
Can it really cure my illness?

469
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,460
It's possible.

470
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,520
There's a bed there specifically for healing wounds.

471
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,450
Let me ask something related to me.

472
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,980
What's the deal with my family heirloom?

473
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,720
Why can it detect the monster?

474
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,800
I remember you mentioned before

475
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,240
that your family heirloom has been passed down for over a hundred years.

476
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
But that monster

477
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,880
only appeared when

478
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,940
these outsiders first arrived here,

479
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,610
just over twenty years ago.

480
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,000
This suggests

481
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,690
the monster existed before the heirloom.

482
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,770
How do you explain this?

483
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,800
Exactly.

484
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,600
It's like

485
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,680
having insoles before shoes.

486
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,130
How strange is that?

487
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,540
This is indeed difficult to explain.

488
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,960
It's just like

489
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,890
we don't understand

490
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,840
why you look the same as us.

491
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,400
But our minds

492
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,320
are restricted by something.

493
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,160
In the vast universe,

494
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
are there more people

495
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,440
who look just like us?

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,240
Why is that?

497
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,160
There's always someone better,

498
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,420
always a higher power.

499
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,080
What you've done to us is beyond our understanding

500
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,210
because you are more powerful than us.

501
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,420
But isn't there

502
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,600
someone more powerful than you?

503
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,420
After all this talk...

504
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,880
What we care about most is

505
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,000
whether those people whose bodies you've taken over can ever return.

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,330
Especially my brother.

507
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,040
Where is his soul?

508
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,800
How can we drive out the King of Jingnan's soul

509
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,260
and bring my brother back?

510
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,360
Once a body is occupied by another soul,

511
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,860
it cannot be reversed.

512
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,800
The original soul

513
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,480
can never return.

514
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,440
When a soul is suppressed,

515
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,260
it's equivalent to death.

516
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,280
So,

517
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,720
the moment your brother became the King of Jingnan,

518
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,240
he was already dead.

519
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,330
The same goes for Tongtong.

520
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,840
I'm sorry.

521
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,680
Although

522
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,000
I've drawn you a maze,

523
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,680
this maze

524
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,200
has no exit.

525
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,640
Why do you know so much more

526
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,740
compared to the other outsiders?

527
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,040
Because I'm like Cao Jiande and He Xiguang.

528
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,560
We're all initiators of the migration.

529
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,360
This time coming to Dengzhou

530
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,760
was led by me.

531
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,440
So all we're suffering now

532
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,040
is because of you.

533
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,440
Get out of my way.

534
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,480
Your Tongtong is already dead.

535
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,240
But Aunt Ji is still here.

536
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,300
She needs her granddaughter,

537
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,880
even if she's fake.

538
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,240
Move aside.

539
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,320
During this time,

540
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,060
you've been both familiar and strange to me.

541
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,730
Now only the strangeness remains.

542
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,720
To be honest,

543
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,920
if you weren't wearing that face,

544
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,770
Zeng Qian wouldn't need to act.

545
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,730
I would kill you myself.

546
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,040
I'm very grateful

547
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,360
for your care these days.

548
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,440
Aunt Ji is a good mother-in-law.

549
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,880
You're a good father too.

550
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,160
But

551
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,480
I can never return to your side.

552
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,040
That's not for you to decide.

553
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,440
It's not up to you either.

554
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,810
From the moment I stepped into the Baili mansion,

555
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,280
I could never leave again.

556
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
You won't kill me,

557
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,880
but they will.

558
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,760
I came to your world

559
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,640
just wanting to live,

560
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,920
even if selfishly.

561
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,680
In our world,

562
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,240
there are many people like me.

563
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
This might be

564
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,080
the reason for our extinction.

565
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,720
The letter you wrote to Aunt Ji was really good.

566
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,170
I was genuinely moved at that time,

567
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,330
not pretending.

568
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,600
If there's another life,

569
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
I hope

570
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,320
we can become a family.

571
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,000
But in this life,

572
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,370
you should forget about Tongtong.

573
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,480
You knew all along.

574
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,180
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

575
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I can imagine

576
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,880
how desperate you would feel after knowing the truth.

577
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,530
I didn't have the courage to face this.

578
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,450
But I don't want to keep deceiving you.

579
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,280
False hope

580
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,160
is more painful than despair.

581
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,960
But some people

582
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,320
need to live on such illusory hope.

583
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,360
Despair at least makes us stop.

584
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,320
While false hope only pushes us forward,

585
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,720
straight into the abyss.

586
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,840
Qian'er.

587
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,400
Let it go.

588
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,860
I don't want you to seek out the Prince of Jingnan

589
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,780
and throw your life away for nothing.

590
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,800
What's the difference

591
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,400
between my current situation and that?

592
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,040
What do you think

593
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,400
we could say to comfort Zeng Qian and Feng Buhai?

594
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,320
Hey, you two,

595
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
say something.

596
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
What should I say?

597
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,360
Say what?

598
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Just something

599
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
that might comfort them.

600
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,160
If I knew what to say,

601
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,840
I would have said it already.

602
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,440
Any comfort now would just be rubbing salt in their wounds.

603
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,900
Let's give them some time.

604
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,810
Are you okay?

605
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,410
Are you alright?

606
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,040
I...

607
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,840
Look at that wound.

608
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,040
It's too noticeable.

609
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,960
Here's what we'll do.

610
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,520
Let me get you some medicine to apply.

611
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:17,980
No need.

612
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,280
The medicine is specially made by me.

613
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,800
It not only heals quickly,

614
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,440
but also matches your skin tone.

615
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,080
It can conceal the wound.

616
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,140
No one will notice.

617
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,370
Wait for me a moment.

618
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Greetings, Miss.

619
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm looking for Tongtong.

620
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Is she in her room?

621
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,280
I don't know.

622
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,600
I knocked but no one answered.

623
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,800
She might be resting.

624
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
There's no one on the bed either.

625
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,160
What's wrong?

626
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,700
Miss, look at this.

627
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,120
I came looking for Tongtong earlier.

628
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,240
The door was closed.

629
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,080
I pushed it open and came in.

630
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,940
No one was here.

631
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,040
She found this note on the table.

632
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,760
It was under the food box.

633
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,400
When did you deliver the food box?

634
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,280
Miss,

635
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,000
I delivered it this morning.

636
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,000
Was Tongtong there at that time?

637
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,720
Yes.

638
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,040
After you delivered the food box,

639
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
did anyone enter or leave this room?

640
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,040
No.

641
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,340
How can you be sure?

642
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,890
I've been waiting in the front courtyard the whole time.

643
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
You may leave now.

644
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Don't tell anyone

645
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,740
about this matter.

646
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,120
Yes, Miss.

647
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,960
The question now is

648
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,620
whether she left voluntarily or was kidnapped.

649
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,080
Is the handwriting on the note hers?

650
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,420
I recognize her old handwriting,

651
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
but I haven't seen her recent writing.

652
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,720
I've only seen those strange symbols she draws.

653
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,280
That means

654
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,090
both possibilities exist.

655
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,360
I checked everything before you arrived.

656
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
At that time, there was no one in the room

657
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,890
except for me and that maid.

658
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,360
The windows were locked from inside

659
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,020
with no signs of forced entry.

660
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,159
So how did she disappear from here?

661
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,360
If she left voluntarily,

662
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,800
she might have taken

663
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,860
some strange object from He Xiguang.

664
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,560
If she was abducted,

665
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,280
whoever did it managed to do it without a trace,

666
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,340
leaving absolutely nothing behind.

667
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,880
It's so bizarre.

668
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,679
The only thing I can think of is the Jingnan Prince's Jiya.

669
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,880
Didn't they say the two Jiya shouldn't come into contact easily?

670
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,159
Then the King of Jingnan's Jiya

671
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,880
shouldn't have rashly come here.

672
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,199
But besides these two possibilities,

673
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,400
I can't think of any other explanation.

674
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
I just told that maid

675
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,560
not to spread the news.

676
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,820
I was thinking that

677
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,810
if Tongtong left on her own,

678
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,739
then once you find her,

679
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,920
you'll have a chance to bring her back to Aunt Ji,

680
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,850
instead of keeping her trapped in the Baili mansion.

681
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,760
If she was kidnapped,

682
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,240
then whoever did it,

683
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
whether it's the King of Jingnan or someone else,

684
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,720
this opponent

685
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,780
won't be easy to deal with.

686
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,160
No matter what,

687
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
I should return to Dengzhou now.

688
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,360
My father fears I'll go looking for the King of Jingnan,

689
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,040
so he won't let me leave easily.

690
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,840
You should go back with Cao Sheng and the others first.

691
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,900
I'll find a chance to meet up with you.

692
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,240
See you in Dengzhou.

693
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,160
That's way too brief.

694
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,490
What does that mean?

695
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,460
It means we should go back now.

696
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,720
What's this child up to?

697
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,140
Where's Zeng Qian?

698
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,160
She said she'll secretly gather information at the mansion

699
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,760
to see if there are any clues.

700
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,880
Now,

701
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,920
I need to ask you some questions.

702
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,400
Your answers

703
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,560
had better satisfy me.

704
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,730
Understand?

705
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,780
An answer that satisfies you,

706
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,200
if it's false,

707
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,640
what's the point?

708
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
This answer

709
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,690
doesn't satisfy me.

710
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,420
You'd better think carefully before answering me.

711
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,680
The next arrow

712
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,160
won't miss its mark.

713
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,920
Can my brother return?

714
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,740
I've already told you,

715
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,600
no.

716
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,700
I'll ask you one last time.

717
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,400
Can my brother

718
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,920
return or not?
