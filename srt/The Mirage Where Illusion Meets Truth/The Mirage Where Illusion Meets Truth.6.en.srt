1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,640
Mr. Xie

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,700
That's too formal,

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,480
bringing all these treats.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,280
Now that's being formal, Daniu.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,520
How long has it been since we've seen each other?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,560
Isn't it normal for me to come visit you?

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,680
I'll arrange for all of us brothers to have a good drink later, alright?

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,560
Good.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,400
Sounds good.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,120
But right now,

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,560
My stomach...

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,720
I'm having some trouble.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
Do you have a toilet here?

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,570
I'll take you there.

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,520
Come.

16
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,800
Wait here.

17
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,120
Come.

18
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,680
This way.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,039
Miss,

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,600
you bought so much pine resin oil.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,720
You need to be careful with it.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,520
This stuff catches fire easily.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,080
Here.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,810
Thank you, miss.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,560
Let's go.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,640
Nice weather today.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,240
Yes, it is.

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,140
What's that sound?

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,900
Let's hurry and leave.

30
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,600
Zeng Qian!

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,460
What is that noise?

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,479
Didn't you follow the method I taught you?

33
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,080
I

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,759
It's been half a day already

35
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,520
and you haven't made any progress at all.

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
People who don't know better might think

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,980
my Qingfeng House has added pig slaughtering to its business.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,960
Maybe it's because you're such a good teacher.

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,560
So I'm your teacher now, huh?

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,700
Then I'd better show you what I can do.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,600
How

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,200
did you do that?

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,320
The reason everyone's voice sounds different

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,760
is because when we speak,

45
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,320
besides our throat,

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,680
our chest, pharynx, mouth, nose, and head

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,760
all play a part.

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,240
You need to learn to control them first.

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
But anyway,

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,760
expecting you to learn

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,160
to sound exactly like Chen Qi

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,090
in such a short time is impossible.

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,120
Let's do this.

54
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,440
Sixty percent similarity will do.

55
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,560
For the remaining forty percent, blame it on a cold.

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,400
Just say you've caught a cold these days

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,329
and your throat is uncomfortable.

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
How close do you think it sounds now?

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,240
You can't just rely on the cold excuse.

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,720
Here,

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,120
now,

62
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,560
take a deep breath,

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,880
together,

64
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,340
pull in.

65
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,890
Come, look this way.

66
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,020
Chen Qi is back.

67
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,320
Young Master,

68
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,440
is this really necessary?

69
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,040
It's just about meeting her.

70
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,980
There can be no mistakes in this plan.

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Falling asleep during it would cause trouble.

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
Alright.

73
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,740
I'll help you then.

74
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,500
No need.

75
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
I'll do it myself.

76
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,050
I'm quite experienced now.

77
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,680
Let me offer you another bowl, young master.

78
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,400
No, no, no.

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,360
I'll drink this bowl first.

80
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,840
Brothers from Qianhuo have suffered following Brother Daniu.

81
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,520
I'll take this one first. Come on.

82
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,640
Then let's all drink together!

83
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,480
Come on!

84
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,700
Bottoms up!

85
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,080
Drink up!

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,890
What's that noise outside?

87
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Niu, what noise could there be?

88
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,040
Have a seat.

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,120
It's just the booze worms in our brothers' bellies crying out.

90
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,920
Come on.

91
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,880
Here.

92
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,360
Drink up.

93
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,090
Drink it now.

94
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,780
Come on, eat some food.

95
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,120
Fill it up.

96
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,800
Come here.

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What for?

98
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,000
I haven't bathed for days.

99
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
Afraid I might smell.

100
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,040
And I caught a cold.

101
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,040
Don't want to infect you.

102
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,700
It doesn't matter. Come here.

103
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,860
Isn't it too tight?

104
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,120
It's fine.

105
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
It can be tighter.

106
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,280
To get through a body search,

107
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,010
this alone might not be enough.

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,960
I have a plan.

109
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,560
I'm driving

110
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
a manure cart.

111
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,280
How many days since you bathed?

112
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,570
Let's go.

113
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,080
Open the gate!

114
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,650
The usual rules.

115
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,820
Everyone handles their own area.

116
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,600
Hya!

117
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,880
Hya!

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,320
Clean the bucket thoroughly!

119
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
Got it!

120
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,320
Before you leave, I want to talk to you again.

121
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,200
If you successfully enter the Taoist temple,

122
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
don't rush things.

123
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,320
You might think the simplest and most direct approach

124
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,040
is to capture one or two people,

125
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
extract Axin's location from them,

126
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,520
or force them to take you to Axin.

127
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,010
But they are well-trained.

128
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,690
If you encounter fanatics willing to die,

129
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,240
you'll be exposed.

130
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,620
Then forget about rescuing Axin.

131
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,300
Even your own escape would be questionable.

132
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,120
Even if you manage to escape,

133
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,920
we won't get another chance.

134
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,680
A direct attack is burning our bridges.

135
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,400
Only cunning gives us room to maneuver.

136
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
You are a hunter,

137
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,010
skilled at hiding and lurking.

138
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,330
Plus we're operating at night.

139
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,640
So the temple

140
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
becomes your forest.

141
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,760
As long as you stay calm and controlled,

142
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,160
they won't discover you.

143
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,960
Won't find you.

144
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
We'll have time,

145
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
and with time,

146
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,880
we'll have opportunity.

147
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,560
Young Taoist,

148
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,120
your whistle is really pretty.

149
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Look,

150
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,040
I have one too.

151
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,880
Yours isn't as nice as mine,

152
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,000
nor as loud.

153
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,120
That's because you blow it well.

154
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,920
Young Taoist,

155
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,520
who gave you that whistle?

156
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,600
Nobody gave it to me.

157
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,320
I found it myself.

158
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,080
You're lying to me.

159
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,400
I'm not lying.

160
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
I really did find it.

161
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,160
Where did you find it?

162
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,960
Yichen!

163
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,160
Yichen!

164
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,360
Master, I'm here.

165
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Yichen,

166
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
what are you doing here?

167
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,600
It's almost dawn.

168
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,120
Time for morning prayers.

169
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,920
Hurry up.

170
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,720
There was a lady just now.

171
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,560
What lady?

172
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,120
Being late for morning prayers is one thing,

173
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,200
but now you're lying too.

174
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,280
I'm not.

175
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,760
Where did you get this whistle?

176
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,600
I found it at the entrance of the Sanqing Hall.

177
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,560
Didn't I tell you not to go to Sanqing Hall?

178
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,520
There are peach blossoms there.

179
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,880
I wanted to collect some.

180
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
There aren't any elsewhere.

181
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Alright.

182
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,880
Remember,

183
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,440
don't go there again.

184
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,840
Let's go.

185
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,720
There are peach blossoms there,

186
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
and nowhere else.

187
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,720
Why hasn't Chen Qi returned yet?

188
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,680
Indeed.

189
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,040
Why is he so slow this time?

190
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,700
He used to be quite efficient.

191
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,960
Brother Wang.

192
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
Has something happened to Chen Qi?

193
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Should we go look for him?

194
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,180
You can't wander around here.

195
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,620
There are patrols.

196
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,880
If nothing else works, let's ask him

197
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
what we should do.

198
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,400
If we can successfully enter the Taoist temple

199
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
and find Axin.

200
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
How can we rescue him?

201
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,260
Now we're at the crucial step.

202
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,000
If Zeng Xin is definitely in the Taoist temple,

203
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,160
then his current situation

204
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,840
must be one of two possibilities.

205
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
First, he could be under house arrest.

206
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,920
Second, he could be imprisoned.

207
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,200
But regardless of which one it is,

208
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,720
there will certainly be guards watching at the door.

209
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,520
I'm very confident that you can locate

210
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,050
Zeng Xin's exact position.

211
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,240
But rather than alarming the guards

212
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,960
and putting yourself at a disadvantage,

213
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,080
why don't we actively create chaos

214
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,610
to divert their attention?

215
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Fishing in troubled waters.

216
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,000
How's it going, Mr. Wang?

217
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
Chen Qi has disappeared.

218
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,860
Should we tell them or not?

219
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,840
If we keep wasting time like this,

220
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,160
if something really happens,

221
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,820
what if we get dragged into it?

222
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,840
Say something, will you?

223
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,920
Where's Sun?

224
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,920
Sun?

225
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,520
He was just here.

226
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,680
Where did he go?

227
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,040
Sun!

228
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,420
Now we've lost two people.

229
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,480
That's it.

230
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,100
I have to tell them.

231
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,280
Chen Qi is back.

232
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,500
Where is everyone?

233
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Let's get out of here.

234
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,720
Alright then.

235
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,980
I'll have one with you.

236
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,760
Why are you still drinking?

237
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,360
Wuji Temple is on fire!

238
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,120
Master Xie, I must go.

239
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,720
Brothers!

240
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,440
Go!

241
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,300
Hurry, please!

242
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,920
Everyone be careful!

243
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
Hurry!

244
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,040
Keep up!

245
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,120
Follow me!

246
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,040
Why is nobody here?

247
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,800
I don't know.

248
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,200
What's going on?

249
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,000
Open the door!

250
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
You can't come in.

251
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,840
We're from

252
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,480
the fire brigade.

253
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,720
Isn't there a fire inside?

254
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,250
We can handle it ourselves.

255
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,440
Hurry!

256
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,300
Pour the water!

257
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,700
More water!

258
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,440
Quickly!

259
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,900
Coming!

260
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,520
More!

261
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,040
Over here!

262
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,120
Hurry up!

263
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,820
Who are you people anyway?

264
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,140
Why won't you let us in?

265
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,100
Let me tell you.

266
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,020
If this Taoist temple burns down,

267
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,080
you'll all be held responsible.

268
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,600
Why haven't the firefighters arrived yet?

269
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Aren't they already here?

270
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,120
Why aren't they going in?

271
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,480
Open the door!

272
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Come with me quickly.

273
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,680
Can't we handle this ourselves?

274
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,940
Now they're letting us in,

275
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,000
but I don't even want to anymore.

276
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,210
Boss,

277
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,640
let's not just be stubborn.

278
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,040
If this temple burns down,

279
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,370
we'll all be in trouble.

280
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,290
Let's go. Follow me.

281
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,880
Hurry up!

282
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,960
Water!

283
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,560
Hurry!

284
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,840
This way!

285
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,300
Keep up!

286
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,360
Axin.

287
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,570
Come with me.

288
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,320
Who are you?

289
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,840
Let me go!

290
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,320
For a young lady,

291
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,440
you're quite capable.

292
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,320
Who are you people?

293
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,440
And who are you?

294
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,120
It doesn't matter.

295
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,880
You'll find out soon enough.

296
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,800
Take her away.

297
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,600
Yes.

298
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,680
You thief!

299
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,280
We have plenty of ways to make you tell the truth.

300
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,320
That voice...

301
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Thank goodness I recognized your voice.

302
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,050
Why are you here?

303
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,530
Let's talk outside.

304
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,920
Axin.

305
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,920
Wake up.

306
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,000
Axin.

307
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,040
Don't worry.

308
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,500
It's just a sleeping drug.

309
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,880
Let's go.

310
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
Stop right there!

311
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,600
We're out of water bags.

312
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,460
I need to bring some back quickly.

313
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
Open the gate!

314
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,960
Wait.

315
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,840
You're moving water bags

316
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,480
by yourself?

317
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,440
I'll send two men to help you.

318
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,920
You two.

319
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,200
Open the gate!

320
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,560
Young Master,

321
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,420
what about this stealth vehicle?

322
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,240
Burn it.

323
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,690
That Qianji Guard commander went to Wuji Temple.

324
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,730
Who's there?

325
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,480
Just a moment.

326
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,360
Come in.

327
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,080
Cao Sheng, what are you doing?

328
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,320
Young Master.

329
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,160
Zeng Xin hasn't woken up yet.

330
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,400
Will he be alright?

331
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,800
You'll have to ask Dr. Xie about that.

332
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,120
After all, the knockout drug

333
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,240
was provided by him.

334
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,680
Don't worry. It's fine.

335
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,360
That medicine is my special formula.

336
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,960
He'll wake up after 5 or 6 hours of sleep at most.

337
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,040
Aren't you a doctor?

338
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,920
Why are you studying this kind of thing?

339
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,520
I originally intended to deal with Gu Tingmei.

340
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,560
Who?

341
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,570
The one who stole my things.

342
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,520
Cao Sheng.

343
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,320
I helped you rescue Zeng Xin.

344
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,600
Now

345
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,520
it's your turn to help me.

346
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,280
I'll give you the one-eyed little beggar first.

347
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,800
What?

348
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,480
You found him?

349
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,240
He's been back from his disappearance for two days.

350
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,560
Those bounty hunters still haven't found him.

351
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,000
How did you find him?

352
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,200
The question is,

353
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,660
with so many bounty hunters looking for him,

354
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,080
why couldn't they find him?

355
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,800
If the little beggar, like others,

356
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
also suffered from amnesia,

357
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,000
not remembering who he is,

358
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,640
or what happened before,

359
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,160
then he wouldn't be hiding out of fear

360
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,880
from seeing the armored man kill someone.

361
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,940
If he's not hiding,

362
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,840
he still needs to fill his stomach.

363
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,700
Either begging

364
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,460
or working for others.

365
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,720
If he were begging,

366
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,580
he would have been found early on.

367
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,960
So that leaves only working for others.

368
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,800
The work he's doing now

369
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,560
must involve minimal contact with people.

370
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,520
It can't be at teahouses or taverns where he'd be visible.

371
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,040
Otherwise, he would have been found already.

372
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,720
After eliminating possibilities,

373
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
we're left with

374
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,840
dock laborers,

375
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,680
coffin shop assistants,

376
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,450
stable hands and such jobs.

377
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,770
The options are few.

378
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,600
I had Yunniang make some inquiries.

379
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,330
Sure enough,

380
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,600
she found him at the coffin shop.

381
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,520
To prevent other hitmen from finding him and causing trouble,

382
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,650
I had Yunniang put him in that old shack

383
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,320
with plenty of food and drink.

384
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
Indeed.

385
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,239
Having many people isn't always effective.

386
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,699
You need the right person.

387
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,800
But you said it yourself.

388
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,719
He doesn't remember anything.

389
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,360
Even if you've found him,

390
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,449
he can't prove your innocence.

391
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,810
Don't worry about that.

392
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm a doctor.

393
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Soul loss is a difficult condition,

394
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
but it's not completely incurable.

395
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,280
I'll bring this troublemaker back now.

396
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,840
These records

397
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,600
I brought them back from the Taoist temple.

398
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,200
What's depicted here?

399
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,820
A ritual ceremony.

400
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,970
Look at the image below.

401
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,880
The 19th year of Jingyun reign,

402
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,680
23 years ago.

403
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,680
The mirage had already appeared back then.

404
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,560
Until now,

405
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,090
the mirage has appeared at least three times.

406
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,500
The first time was at Gaomeng Lake over 20 years ago.

407
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,210
The second time was at Huohe River four years ago.

408
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,640
The third time is now in Dengzhou.

409
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
The three appearances of the mirage

410
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,880
all have one thing in common.

411
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,080
Look.

412
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,660
This is the one at Huohe River.

413
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,160
Although the mirage appeared in Luori Valley,

414
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,890
it wasn't far from Huohe River.

415
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,240
Gaomeng Lake itself is a shallow water area.

416
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,480
Dengzhou has Mirror Lake.

417
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,400
All three mirages appeared near water.

418
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,520
Yes.

419
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,480
Why is that?

420
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,600
Also,

421
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,600
who are those people at the Taoist temple?

422
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,930
How do they know so much about the mirages?

423
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,960
I'm not sure.

424
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,560
But every time a mirage appears,

425
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,480
there's another common factor -

426
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,640
people disappear.

427
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,720
For the one at Luori Valley,

428
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,180
we don't know the details.

429
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,480
But from what we've seen in Dengzhou and Gaomeng Lake,

430
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,930
nearly 200 people disappeared each time.

431
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,820
This document records

432
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,970
the list of people who disappeared during the Gaomeng Lake mirage.

433
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,580
These people all disappeared on the sixth day of May

434
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,050
and returned two days later on the eighth.

435
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,480
Just like what happened in Dengzhou this time.

436
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,240
Except all these people...

437
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
They're all dead.

438
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,300
Protector Ding

439
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Everyone on this list died within a year.

440
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,560
If the situation in Dengzhou

441
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,220
is the same as in Gaomeng Lake,

442
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,160
then everyone who returned

443
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,040
will also

444
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
die.
