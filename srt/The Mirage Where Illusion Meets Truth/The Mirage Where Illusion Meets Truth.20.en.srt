1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,720
Will my brother

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,440
ever come back?

3
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,240
Come out.

4
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,850
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,680
I came out for some fresh air.

6
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,360
I saw this charming house and decided to take a look.

7
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,440
Why are you here too?

8
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,400
Can't you tell?

9
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm practicing archery.

10
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,090
Wearing these clothes?

11
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,100
I've gotten used to them these past few days.

12
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,479
See you in Dengzhou.

13
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,000
That's way too brief.

14
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,759
What's this child up to now?

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,860
Where's Zeng Qian?

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
She said she'll quietly ask around the mansion first

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,480
to see if there are any clues.

18
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,960
I want to find that maid and ask her more questions.

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,820
Let's split up.

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,040
Master Xie, come with me.

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,240
I want to check

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,680
if there was something wrong with Tongtong's breakfast.

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,200
Alright.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll go back to Tongtong's room.

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
If someone had broken in

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,400
and taken Tongtong hostage,

27
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,920
there would surely be some trace left behind.

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,079
This kind of disappearance seems like

29
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,250
the work of a mirage.

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,920
So this note

31
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,410
was written by a mirage?

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,100
These rice grains shouldn't be here.

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,740
Isn't it normal to have a few grains of rice on the table?

34
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,760
Tongtong disappeared after breakfast.

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,329
There was no rice at breakfast.

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,240
Lunch has rice,

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
but lunch hasn't been touched yet.

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,240
Well,

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,000
those were left from last night.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,920
If last night's dishes weren't cleaned up properly,

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,120
then when the maid came with breakfast today,

42
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,160
she would have cleaned the table.

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,640
It's unlikely she would leave rice grains behind.

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,400
Besides,

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,040
these grains were clearly pressed by something.

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,400
So they most likely came along with the breakfast box

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
and appeared here together.

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,440
They were stuck to the bottom of the food box,

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,560
which is why they're flattened like this.

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,160
The maid didn't notice them.

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,240
When she took away the food box,

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,040
the rice grains were already stuck to the table.

53
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,600
But she didn't have time to clean up

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,360
because she saw this note.

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,280
This note...

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,680
There are two spots that look different in color.

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,960
Like some kind of marks.

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,760
They feel a bit hard to the touch.

59
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,160
It seems like...

60
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,080
This note was attached to the breakfast box

61
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,340
when it was brought in.

62
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,480
Let's assume

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,120
that there were rice grains stuck to both sides of this note.

64
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,850
Fewer grains on the front side,

65
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,159
and a bit more on the back.

66
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,500
When the maid brought the food box

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,420
and placed it on the table,

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,280
the back side stuck to the table because it had more rice grains.

69
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,520
When the maid took away the food box at noon,

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,640
the note would naturally be left here.

71
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,100
So that's how it happened.

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,120
Then who did it?

73
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,520
What was their purpose?

74
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
They wanted to confuse us about when Tongtong disappeared.

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,120
Let's assume

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,680
that Tongtong disappeared after Zeng Qian and the maid came in.

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,080
Then with this note,

78
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,480
we would believe she had disappeared earlier.

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Could that maid be suspicious?

80
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,880
According to this reasoning,

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,800
Tongtong should still have been in the room when they arrived.

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,160
The first person who went into the inner room

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,290
and claimed that Tongtong was missing

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,760
was Zeng Qian.

85
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Xie Jingtang found sleeping drugs in Tongtong's breakfast.

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,320
The one who drugged it

87
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,440
must be Zeng Qian.

88
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Baili Yuan said

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,640
that in his mansion,

90
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,240
everything that comes in is carefully checked.

91
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,840
It would be impossible for others to add drugs.

92
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,280
But with Zeng Qian's current position,

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,680
she can.

94
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,240
Zeng Qian went to the kitchen beforehand,

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,440
put sleeping drugs in Tongtong's breakfast,

96
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,040
then found a chance to stick the note at the bottom of the food box.

97
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,720
Be careful.

98
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
Don't spill the food box.

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
I was careless.

100
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,720
Please forgive me, Miss.

101
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,480
After Tongtong finished breakfast,

102
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,280
the sleeping drug took effect.

103
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,740
drowsiness overcame her,

104
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,780
and she fell asleep in bed.

105
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,120
By noon,

106
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,840
Zeng Qian pretended to run into the maid

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
and went to find Tongtong together.

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
After entering the room,

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,280
the maid was cleaning the table.

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,280
Zeng Qian took the opportunity to enter the inner chamber.

111
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,200
She secretly hid Tongtong

112
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,250
who was unconscious on the bed.

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
There's no one on the bed.

114
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,720
Then Zeng Qian sent the maid to notify Feng Buhai,

115
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,520
leaving her alone in the room.

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,810
She then quietly moved Tongtong away.

117
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,720
And the note she left behind.

118
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,560
Successfully helped her clear her suspicion.

119
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,250
Last time she almost killed Tongtong.

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,640
Now she's taken her away again.

121
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Isn't that...

122
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,200
She should be safe for now.

123
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,960
Otherwise she wouldn't have used sleeping drugs.

124
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,560
She would've used poison instead.

125
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,880
She wrote that note to mislead us.

126
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,540
To make us go back to Dengzhou.

127
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,040
But why would she kidnap Tongtong?

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,170
We'll know when we find her.

129
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,820
It's a bit hot outside.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,080
Let's go inside and rest for a while.

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,480
It's even hotter inside.

132
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,200
Then why are you practicing archery indoors?

133
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,720
I just want some quiet time alone.

134
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,120
You should go back first.

135
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm a bit tired from the journey.

136
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,010
I'd like to rest for a while.

137
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
There's a pavilion in the woods outside.

138
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Go there instead.

139
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,490
I didn't see it when I came earlier.

140
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,690
I'll take you there.

141
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,440
Let's go.

142
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Why are you alone?

143
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,409
Why did you save her?

144
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,720
You're not me.

145
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,679
What right do you have to tell me to let go?

146
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,200
I wasn't trying to persuade you.

147
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,530
But that's what you did.

148
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,799
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,240
I just didn't have any other choice.

150
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,040
You did.

151
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,530
You could have stayed out of it.

152
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Tongtong can't escape.

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,160
I will find her.

154
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,080
Don't forget,

155
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,960
my current identity

156
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,820
is no longer just a hunter.

157
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
What does Zeng Qian mean by that?

158
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,640
So she's using her identity as Bai Liyuan's daughter

159
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
to threaten us now.

160
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,680
Even though we've run so far,

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
she could still find us with her people.

162
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,600
Is she really that heartless?

163
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,660
That can't be true.

164
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,480
No,

165
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,140
didn't you see that arrow she shot into the room?

166
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,560
If Tongtong had been hanging there,

167
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
she would certainly be dead.

168
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,760
But on the other hand,

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,640
I understand her too.

170
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,280
After all that effort,

171
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
only to find out her brother is dead

172
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,900
and never coming back.

173
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,600
Who could bear that?

174
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
That old bastard.

175
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,920
I'm not cursing Tongtong,

176
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,040
I'm cursing that old man.

177
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,080
Thank you for saving me.

178
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,280
That night, watching you walk away,

179
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,180
I knew Tongtong was gone forever.

180
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,680
I've cut off all my hopes.

181
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,200
Although

182
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,040
I don't know how to explain this to Aunt Ji yet,

183
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,320
but

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,400
I know

185
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,560
this is the reality I must face.

186
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,720
Later when you disappeared,

187
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,440
I don't know why I became so anxious again,

188
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,480
or why I wanted to save you.

189
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,360
I just felt

190
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,480
like it was the right thing to do.

191
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,640
Though Tongtong is gone,

192
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,640
in your heart,

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,530
perhaps she's still there.

194
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,320
Will you still take me back to Dengzhou?

195
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
What's the point of that?

196
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,370
I can't keep you silent,

197
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,280
nor can I chain you up every day.

198
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,560
I didn't save you to capture you.

199
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,040
If you want to leave,

200
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,960
then go.

201
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,210
Now I really understand Zeng Qian.

202
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,680
The greatest despair isn't failing to get something,

203
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,880
but discovering after all your efforts

204
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,440
that what you got isn't what you wanted.

205
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,140
This might be the last time we see each other.

206
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,800
I won't have any news about you anymore.

207
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,720
All those things I used to care about with Tongtong -

208
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,650
whether she was well-fed and warm,

209
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,400
whether she was happy,

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,860
whether she was healthy and safe -

211
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,320
will have nothing to do with you.

212
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,240
Of course.

213
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,090
And they won't have anything to do with me either.

214
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,160
This is a message from the Crown Prince by carrier pigeon.

215
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
My sister is so stubborn.

216
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,520
Even now,

217
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,280
she still believes she can save Zeng Xin.

218
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,960
Cao Sheng and his people have left Baili Manor.

219
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,120
Does this affect your plan?

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,320
For me,

221
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,330
Cao Sheng was never important.

222
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,290
As long as Zeng Qian is still there, it's fine.

223
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Next, we'll make sure Zeng Qian learns about that map.

224
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,580
Even if Baili Yuan doesn't agree,

225
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,560
she'll do anything to save Zeng Xin.

226
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,820
She'll even steal it for me if necessary.

227
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,080
This Lao Ba,

228
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,490
he didn't complete the task for me.

229
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,640
I thought he had betrayed me.

230
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,280
Now he's sending me messages again.

231
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,640
He's really getting more and more bold.

232
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,920
It seems he's now caught between you and Baili Yuan,

233
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,250
unable to choose sides.

234
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,570
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

235
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
Trying not to offend either side

236
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,840
will only end up offending both.

237
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm still searching for the remaining files from Zouwu Institute.

238
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
Keep searching in the Secret Archives too.

239
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,560
Although these were taken out by the Crown Prince,

240
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,900
there might still be something left behind.

241
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,520
It's already been arranged.

242
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,920
We'll have news soon.

243
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
I'm so hungry.

244
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,080
What food did you bring back?

245
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,920
Not a single surprise.

246
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,020
Have something to eat.

247
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,410
Don't feel bad anymore.

248
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,850
Feng Buhai worked hard to get this.

249
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm telling you, stop being sad.

250
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,880
Even if you starve yourself,

251
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Zeng Qian won't come back to call you 'Brother Chong.'

252
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,450
What are you saying, Xie Jingtang?

253
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,200
I was just joking.

254
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,730
Just trying to comfort him.

255
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,970
You really know how to comfort people.

256
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,060
How dare you joke about my young master's nickname?

257
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,160
I really didn't mean it that way.

258
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,400
Isn't he called 'Brother Chong'?

259
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Should I call him Cao Chong instead?

260
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,280
But still,

261
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,040
being called 'Chong' is pretty strange.

262
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,960
Mind your own business.

263
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,280
What's wrong with being called 'Chong'?

264
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,400
The master specifically changed it for him.

265
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,640
So it was changed?

266
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,000
First time I've heard of someone changing a childhood name.

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,460
What was he called before?

268
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,520
This name of yours

269
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,580
was specially changed by Cao Jiande.

270
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,280
I heard that

271
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,200
when the young master was two years old,

272
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,680
the master, for some reason,

273
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,240
suddenly wanted to change his childhood name.

274
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
Actually, his previous name was quite nice.

275
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,520
He was called Lin'er.

276
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,040
They say in the 18th year of Jingyun, there was a great drought,

277
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,000
but on the day the young master was born, it suddenly rained.

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,720
The old master thought it was a good omen,

279
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,319
so he named him Lin'er,

280
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,319
using the 'Lin' from 'timely rain.'

281
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,000
You're 22 years old.

282
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,520
You were born in the 18th year of Jingyun.

283
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,440
You should be 24 years old now.

284
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,200
So why do you tell people you're 22?

285
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,120
My grandfather said I was born during rain.

286
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,800
That I'm the reincarnation of the Dragon King.

287
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,060
He wanted the Dragon King to stay longer.

288
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,120
I celebrated my first birthday three times.

289
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,580
So when I was two years old,

290
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,170
I was actually four.

291
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
The year after you were born,

292
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,490
which was the 19th year of Jingyun,

293
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,460
was when the first mirage appeared at Gaomeng Lake.

294
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,090
Strictly speaking,

295
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,720
Cao Jiande is not your biological father.

296
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,520
Hey,

297
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,360
what have you two been

298
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
talking about all this time?

299
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,690
I've done something wrong.

300
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,530
I've lied to you all.

301
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,240
Actually,

302
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,520
Zeng Xin is still alive.

303
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,680
I have a way to bring him back.

304
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

305
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,560
If you had told us sooner,

306
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,560
we wouldn't have gotten into this mess with Zeng Qian.

307
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,320
I didn't want to help you.

308
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,930
It's because of Cao Jiande.

309
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,120
I hate him.

310
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,040
He betrayed me.

311
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,160
Cao Jiande and I

312
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,760
were lovers once.

313
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,240
Your earlier guess

314
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,500
that I was an old man

315
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,480
was half right.

316
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,720
I am old,

317
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,480
but not an old man.

318
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,840
I'm an old woman.

319
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,720
Back then, Cao Jiande was among the first to arrive here.

320
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,140
According to the plan,

321
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,440
we were supposed to be the second group.

322
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,680
Originally,

323
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,680
we could have reunited quickly.

324
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
But because of that monster's appearance,

325
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,440
our second phase was delayed for over ten years.

326
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,720
During this time,

327
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,960
Cao Jiande repeatedly warned us

328
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,160
not to come here.

329
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,120
At first, I thought

330
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,040
it was because the monster's threat hadn't been eliminated.

331
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Until that incident at Huohe River.

332
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,640
Our plan failed.

333
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,300
That's when I found out

334
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,480
he had already taken a stance against our world.

335
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,840
If I hadn't listened to him that time

336
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,280
and insisted on coming here,

337
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,060
I might have died already.

338
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,400
But this time,

339
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,540
I had no choice but to come.

340
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,200
Because my body on the other side

341
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,020
couldn't hold on anymore.

342
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,690
Before coming here,

343
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,360
I had mentally prepared myself.

344
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,880
This plan could very likely

345
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,720
be ruined by Cao Jiande,

346
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,220
just like what happened at Huo River.

347
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,880
But rather than

348
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
being tortured to death by illness,

349
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,340
I'd prefer to die in my lover's hands.

350
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,240
But unexpectedly,

351
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,320
I finally made it here,

352
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
while he had died.

353
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
This was

354
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
a devastating blow to me.

355
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,280
I was utterly heartbroken.

356
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,360
Until

357
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,490
I discovered your relationship with him.

358
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,160
I knew you were 22 years old,

359
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,000
and calculating from that,

360
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,720
you were born in the 20th year of Jingyun,

361
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,960
the second year after Cao Jiande arrived here.

362
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,280
So Cao Jiande not only betrayed our world,

363
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,920
but also betrayed me.

364
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,920
He was with your mother

365
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,880
and had you.

366
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,400
While I was there,

367
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,460
waiting painfully for over 20 years.

368
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,650
I always kept my promise

369
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,840
and my love for him never wavered.

370
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,000
But I never expected

371
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,480
what I waited for

372
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,200
would end like this.

373
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,160
My love for him naturally turned to hate.

374
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,320
My life lost its direction.

375
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,840
But when I was lost,

376
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,720
He Xiguang found me.

377
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,520
He asked me to help him continue with our plan.

378
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
This way,

379
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,320
I would never

380
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,600
help Zeng Qian save her brother.

381
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,920
Because

382
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,400
although the City of Rebirth can transfer souls,

383
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,170
it cannot be reverse-controlled,

384
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,960
or it would destroy the City of Rebirth.

385
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,720
That would be equivalent to

386
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,720
completely destroying our plan to come to your world.

387
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,000
But if

388
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,640
your actual age is 24,

389
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,840
that means after you were born,

390
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,120
he took over your birth father's body.

391
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,400
He never betrayed me.

392
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,400
I misunderstood him.

393
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,920
And

394
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,480
he changed your nickname to Chong.

395
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,360
In our world,

396
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,360
the pronunciation of Chong means 'star'.

397
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,570
We once promised each other

398
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,200
that our future children would be named after stars.

399
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,730
Not only did he never betray me,

400
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,440
but

401
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,820
he always kept me in his heart.

402
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,610
Your people are really something.

403
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
First, you took over someone else's body,

404
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,280
transferring your soul into Cao Sheng's father.

405
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,440
Isn't that basically the same as killing

406
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,970
Cao Sheng's real father, the true Cao Jiande?

407
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,600
And then you changed the child's nickname

408
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,800
to make it seem like you had a close bond.

409
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,520
Hey, Cao Sheng,

410
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,640
why aren't you reacting at all?

411
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,180
I've known for a long time.

412
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,810
The King of Jingnan told me.

413
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,800
Although you sound sincere,

414
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,560
I wonder if

415
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,320
you're lying to us again.

416
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,800
You keep changing your story.

417
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,960
I have no reason to lie to you anymore.

418
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,820
How many times have you lied to us?

419
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,400
You just said Zeng Xin and the others were dead

420
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,160
and couldn't be saved.

421
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,640
Now you're saying there's a way.

422
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,880
So inconsistent.

423
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,200
What I told you before

424
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,800
was He Xiguang and Baili Yuan's idea.

425
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,960
So you all conspired to deceive us.

426
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,280
Baili Yuan doesn't want Zeng Qian to risk her life by seeking out the Prince of Jingnan.

427
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,400
He hopes I'll reveal the truth

428
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,920
to discourage her from leaving.

429
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,440
Baili Yuan wants Zeng Qian to know certain things

430
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,760
and has entrusted you to tell her.

431
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,640
How much should I tell?

432
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Everything.

433
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Tell the truth.

434
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,920
But the truth they know

435
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,880
is different from what I know.

436
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,600
When someone's body is possessed by another soul,

437
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,500
and the original soul is suppressed,

438
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,120
it's essentially death.

439
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,840
That's what they know.

440
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,360
But He Xiguang came here more than 20 years ago.

441
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,450
During these past two decades,

442
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,580
there have been many breakthroughs in techniques from our world.

443
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,320
I've found a way

444
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,120
to transfer out the possessing soul

445
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,280
and awaken the suppressed original soul,

446
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,000
allowing them to become themselves again.

447
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,400
I haven't told this secret to anyone,

448
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,720
including He Xiguang and Baili Yuan.

449
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,120
So,

450
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,930
when they asked me to tell Zeng Qian the truth,

451
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,500
I only told her what they knew.

452
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,640
Because that's what they wanted.

453
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,490
But what I'm telling you now

454
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,920
is the complete truth.

455
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,200
So

456
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,120
Tongtong's disappearance was your plan.

457
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Qian'er,

458
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,680
you're being foolish.

459
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,800
Why don't you believe what I'm telling you?

460
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,880
Even if you killed her,

461
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,640
she still couldn't help you.

462
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm sorry, Father.

463
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,480
Forget it.

464
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,320
I'll find a way to bring her back.

465
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,280
But there's something more important right now

466
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,440
that I must tell you.

467
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,880
Your mother

468
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,400
is actually still alive.

469
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,000
This is your mother.

470
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,520
I told you before that she was dead.

471
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,740
That wasn't my intention.

472
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Your mother has been seriously ill for many years.

473
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
She actually knew about your return.

474
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,460
But recently her condition suddenly worsened.

475
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,800
She felt her days were numbered.

476
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
If she revealed herself to you,

477
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,960
the result would be

478
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,600
you'd just meet your birth mother

479
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,760
only to face losing her immediately.

480
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
She didn't want you to suffer that pain.

481
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
Since last night,

482
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,200
she's been unconscious.

483
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,650
The doctor's opinion is...

484
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Asked me to prepare for her passing.

485
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,170
After careful consideration,

486
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,050
I decided to bring you to see her one last time.

487
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,120
Although this goes against her wishes.

488
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,320
Sir,

489
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,840
those people you sent out,

490
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,170
have they sent any news?

491
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,800
If you want to save your wife,

492
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
perhaps this is our only hope.

493
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,100
It's been a month already.

494
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,600
There's no progress at all.

495
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,840
You should have told me earlier.

496
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,520
That flower is merely a legend after all.

497
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,680
Unless it was an emergency,

498
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,760
I wouldn't dare speak of it.

499
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,400
That's true.

500
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,240
How could such a miraculous plant exist in this world?

501
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,120
Even if it does exist,

502
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,080
we don't know what it looks like.

503
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,760
With just the name Manzhudai,

504
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,160
we have no way to find it.

505
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,520
Perhaps

506
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,720
this is fate.

507
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,090
This flower you're talking about,

508
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,440
called Manzhudai,

509
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,960
I know it.

510
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,600
Legend says that flower can cure all diseases

511
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,680
and even bring the dead back to life.

512
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,640
It grows in deep mountains

513
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,900
and is extremely rare.

514
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,960
Most people haven't even heard of it.

515
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
I know where it is.

516
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,580
I grew up in Jiuyuan Mountain.

517
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,720
Since childhood, my foster father and I watered a flower with tree oil.

518
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,840
Its name is Manzhudai.

519
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,850
My foster father told me

520
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,000
that protecting this flower is our mission,

521
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,920
passed down through generations.

522
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,040
I just didn't know

523
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,920
that this flower had healing properties.

524
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,640
Nourished with tree oil

525
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
and protected for generations.

526
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,600
So special,

527
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,680
it's very likely to be the Manzhu Dai.

528
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,040
Sir,

529
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,660
if we can find this flower,

530
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,040
your wife can be saved.

531
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,440
I'll draw the location of the flower,

532
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,100
and Father can send someone to fetch it quickly.

533
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,280
So now,

534
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,400
shouldn't we hurry back to find Zeng Qian

535
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,530
and tell her that Zeng Xin can be saved?

536
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
Young Master, what's wrong?

537
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,320
Nothing.

538
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,560
Where there are concerns, there are troubles.

539
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
Plan carefully before acting.

540
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,890
There's something I can't figure out.

541
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,280
When Zeng Qian held a knife to your throat that day,

542
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,360
she must have believed what Tongtong said.

543
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,840
Especially when she embraced me,

544
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,160
I could feel her desperation and breakdown.

545
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,680
Those emotions couldn't be faked.

546
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,280
But later she turned around and suspected Tongtong was lying to her.

547
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,810
Why such a dramatic change?

548
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,920
What exactly happened during that time?

549
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,960
It's normal to change your mind.

550
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,480
Don't you understand her yet?

551
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,600
When she heard she was raised by wolves,

552
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,920
she chose to believe it.

553
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,980
She chose to trust.

554
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,300
So when that wolf was injured,

555
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,960
she went to save it

556
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,880
without any hesitation.

557
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,640
That was a wolf!

558
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,520
Who else could do that?

559
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,280
What strong conviction.

560
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,610
Someone like her...

561
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Once I make up my mind, I never waver.

562
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,290
When I choose to trust someone,

563
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I don't doubt them.

564
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,810
She does seem like that kind of person.

565
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,600
Then she must have had another reason for capturing Tongtong.

566
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,200
That's exactly what I've been thinking about.

567
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,690
Zeng Qian knows us well.

568
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
The trap she set by taking Tongtong,

569
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,000
we should have been able to see through it.

570
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,400
So why did she still do it?

571
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,520
With her current status as Baili Yuan's daughter,

572
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,050
she could have just taken Tongtong directly.

573
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,540
Why go to all that trouble?

574
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,770
The only explanation is...

575
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,160
The trap she set

576
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,460
wasn't aimed at Tongtong,

577
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,680
but at us.

578
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,170
Her real purpose

579
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,940
was to break ties with us completely.

580
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,480
She took Tongtong

581
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,320
knowing that we and Feng Buhai would certainly come to the rescue.

582
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,400
She deliberately created conflict with us

583
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,660
to cause a falling out.

584
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,480
She really put on quite a show.

585
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,000
But according to what Yunniang said,

586
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,280
when she was shooting arrows at you,

587
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,810
she didn't hold back at all.

588
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,920
That's right.

589
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,840
At that time, she was just outside

590
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,370
with only a door between us.

591
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
The way she fired those arrows seemed completely reckless.

592
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,600
Reckless?

593
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Not necessarily.

594
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,960
Zeng Qian has a very keen sense of smell.

595
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,920
We all have a special scent

596
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,100
that she's very sensitive to.

597
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,800
Aicao.

598
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,960
What happened to your neck?

599
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Got bitten by mosquitoes?

600
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,480
I've always attracted mosquitoes since I was little.

601
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,560
Don't they burn mugwort

602
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,800
in the room every night?

603
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm not used to that smell,

604
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,280
so I didn't let them burn it.

605
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,840
So even if she can't see us,

606
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,200
she can identify our positions

607
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,320
by our scent.

608
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,720
She must have known Tongtong wasn't in the previous spot.

609
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,680
So the first arrow that seemed aimed at her

610
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,340
was actually meant to warn us.

611
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,960
Arrows coming.

612
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,840
She knows Yunniang and I well enough

613
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
to know that as long as it's not a sneak attack,

614
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,170
we can block the arrows.

615
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,600
So all those arrows she shot at us later,

616
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,280
she knew exactly what she was doing.

617
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,010
She knew they wouldn't hurt us.

618
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,320
She put on this whole act

619
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,720
because she really wanted to drive us away.

620
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,800
That explains the note about meeting in Dengzhou.

621
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,130
She wanted us to leave from the beginning.

622
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,960
But why would she do this?

623
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,200
I can't figure it out.

624
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,170
Given her personality,

625
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,280
if she deliberately pushes away those close to her,

626
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,400
it means she knows she's in danger.

627
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,600
Just like when she faced danger in the mountains

628
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,240
and barely escaped with her life.

629
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,680
She knew there would be consequences,

630
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,720
which is why she refused to acknowledge me all this time.

631
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,440
But now she's Baili Yuan's daughter

632
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,120
and living in the Baili mansion.

633
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,180
What danger could she possibly be in?

634
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,800
I know something's definitely wrong,

635
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,080
but I don't know exactly what the problem is.

636
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,640
Let's go through everything again,

637
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,980
starting with the Baili mansion.

638
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,570
We sought out Baili Yuan

639
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,720
because we thought

640
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,280
he might help us.

641
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,760
The reason being that we know

642
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,480
he once served as the head of Zouwu Institute,

643
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,120
and he once issued a secret order

644
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,050
for Feng Buhai to rescue Zeng Qian.

645
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,720
Now that Zeng Qian is in trouble,

646
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,920
logically speaking,

647
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,240
he should help her.

648
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,480
But when we arrived at the Baili mansion

649
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,810
and told him about this,

650
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,880
he flatly denied it.

651
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,880
He said that although he had been the head of Zouwu Institute,

652
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,520
he never issued any secret orders.

653
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,840
Zouwu

654
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,520
Zouwu

655
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,210
This was sent by urgent courier from the capital.

656
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,840
There are indeed remaining files in the secret archives,

657
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,900
but they weren't filed in the Zouwu Institute section.

658
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,699
I heard it was found in an inconspicuous corner.

659
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,650
That day when we were in Cao Jiande's carriage house,

660
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,880
did you see a sentence

661
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,600
that mentioned a temple?

662
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,320
I think that sentence was

663
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,680
from the 20th to 36th year of Jingyun,

664
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,560
enter the temple.

665
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,560
The 'Zouwu' in Zouwu Institute,

666
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,000
when you pronounce these two characters together,

667
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
where I come from,

668
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,640
means 'temple.'

669
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,280
So...

670
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,720
So 'entering the temple' means taking over the Zouwu Institute.

671
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,560
It means he wants to become the head of the Zouwu Institute.

672
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,020
But isn't Baili Yuan already in charge of the Zouwu Institute?

673
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,960
How can there be two different personal seals?

674
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,820
If the previous seal belonged to Baili Yuan,

675
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,000
then who does this one

676
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,820
we just got back belong to?

677
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,680
Cao Jiande.

678
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,720
Could it be that

679
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,040
the head of Zouwu Institute

680
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
was actually two different people?

681
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,940
How could there be two people?

682
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,840
Unless

683
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,400
they were two different people in succession,

684
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,240
Baili Yuan and Cao Jiande respectively.

685
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,450
All these files the Crown Prince obtained

686
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,240
are dated from the 19th year of Jingyun.

687
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,360
If all these are authentic,

688
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
then it means that during that year,

689
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,840
the head of Zouwu Institute was indeed Baili Yuan.

690
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,170
But after the 20th year of Jingyun,

691
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,160
it changed to Cao Jiande

692
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,130
all the way until the 36th year of Jingyun.

693
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,600
Eight years ago when I went to rescue Zeng Qian,

694
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,760
it should have been the 34th year of Jingyun.

695
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,080
If the records your father left behind are true,

696
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,740
then the one who gave me the secret order was him,

697
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,760
not Baili Yuan.

698
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,520
Then why would he admit it was his order?

699
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,420
He never admitted it at first.

700
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,920
We pushed him step by step to this point.

701
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,760
No matter how much pressure,

702
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,560
he shouldn't admit to something he didn't do.

703
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,040
What's important is

704
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,760
whether Baili Yuan is really Zeng Qian's father.

705
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,880
He must be,

706
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,440
otherwise how would he know so much about her?

707
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,120
He knows she was raised by a hunter,

708
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,380
knows where she lived,

709
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,410
and about her father's murder.

710
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,360
That's exactly the problem.

711
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,800
If Cao Jiande was the one who gave me the order,

712
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,760
then the only ones who knew about this besides him and me were

713
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,560
the people who attacked Zeng Qian and her adoptive father back then.

714
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,210
So you're saying

715
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,340
Baili Yuan is the one who killed Zeng Qian's father?

716
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,740
And Zeng Qian knows it now.

717
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,200
Then everything Zeng Qian has done

718
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
makes perfect sense.

719
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,720
She must have discovered Baili Yuan is her father's killer,

720
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,580
though we don't know exactly how.

721
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,380
And she also learned that Zeng Xin can never return,

722
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,860
which pushed her into complete despair.

723
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,240
What she wants to do now

724
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,890
is to kill her enemy with her own hands.

725
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,250
But her opponent is Baili Yuan.

726
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,240
She's prepared to die,

727
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,410
which is why she pushed us all away.

728
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,680
It's done.

729
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,800
We hunters

730
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,060
are very familiar with animal hides.

731
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,800
My knife

732
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,480
has a handle wrapped in Kui yak hide,

733
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,740
which is quite common.

734
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,130
But your knife has the extremely rare Wu yak hide.

735
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,040
This type of hide has a special characteristic:

736
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,400
when new, it's dark red,

737
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,120
but over time,

738
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,080
it becomes identical to common yak hide,

739
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,140
indistinguishable to the naked eye.

740
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,340
But when exposed to water,

741
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,400
the two have different colors.

742
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,360
Wu yak hide turns tea-colored,

743
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,920
while Kui yak hide turns brown.

744
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,200
That time by the lake,

745
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,120
I realized the two knives were different

746
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,360
and began to doubt your identity.

747
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,280
Later I snuck into your study

748
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,120
and found that knife.

749
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,240
I confirmed

750
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,280
it was indeed made of Wu yak hide.

751
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,000
And this leather is less than ten years old.

752
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,240
But the story you told me

753
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,080
these two swords were forged before I was born.

754
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,200
You've kept them in perfect condition

755
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,640
without any damage.

756
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,040
This proves

757
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,040
not only are the swords fake,

758
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,520
but that story is fake too,

759
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,360
and your identity as my father is equally false.

760
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,130
You wanted your fabricated story to be flawless,

761
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,300
but that required having a sword identical to mine.

762
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,890
To forge that sword,

763
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,000
you could have used ordinary kui yak leather.

764
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,440
But you used expensive wu yak leather instead.

765
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,560
Why?

766
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
I just realized -

767
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,400
my sword

768
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,040
once had wu yak leather too.

769
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,600
Eight years ago,

770
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,130
I found a piece of new wu yak leather at the market down the mountain.

771
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,180
It was a beautiful bright red.

772
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,120
I begged my father to buy it,

773
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,640
then removed the old leather from my sword

774
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,560
and replaced it with the new wu yak leather.

775
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,730
That same day, my father was attacked.

776
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,120
I believed the new leather on the sword brought bad luck,

777
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,260
so I stopped using it that very night.

778
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,560
You forged such an ordinary sword,

779
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,600
yet made such a serious mistake.

780
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,800
This can only mean one thing:

781
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,960
in your mind, it wasn't a mistake.

782
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,400
You thought my sword originally had wu yak leather,

783
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,530
but I actually only used it for one day,

784
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,140
and that was the day we were attacked.

785
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,960
The only people present then

786
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,170
were Feng Buhai and those men in black.

787
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,840
When Feng Buhai reported back,

788
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,840
he wouldn't have mentioned what my sword looked like.

789
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,480
Because when he arrived,

790
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,200
the sword was already underneath me.

791
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,000
He had no chance to see it.

792
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,160
So regardless of whether you're the head of Zouwu Institute,

793
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,440
you couldn't possibly know

794
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,770
what the sword truly looked like that day.

795
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,240
Feng Buhai told me

796
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,810
that two men in black escaped that day.

797
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,980
I believe one of them was the man I stabbed with my sword.

798
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,080
He saw what my sword looked like.

799
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,640
Therefore,

800
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,080
the person most likely to have forged that sword

801
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,320
is that man in black.

802
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,560
Or perhaps

803
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,160
the person behind him.

804
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Which is you.

805
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,160
After that man in black returned,

806
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,080
he must have told you everything

807
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,450
and specifically mentioned my sword.

808
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,840
You must have made a plan then,

809
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,000
following his description

810
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,250
to forge a sword identical to mine.

811
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,160
But my brother and I went into hiding,

812
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,560
and you couldn't find us.

813
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,000
Your plan couldn't be carried out,

814
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
so the sword was set aside.

815
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,200
The leather on the handle

816
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,080
changed from dark red to how it looks now.

817
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,040
Later, you finally discovered my whereabouts

818
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,040
and lured me to the Baili residence.

819
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,520
You resumed the plan you couldn't execute back then.

820
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,400
You made up a story

821
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,690
to make me believe you were my biological father.

822
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,730
In fact, you're not only not my father,

823
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,210
but on the contrary,

824
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
you're the one who killed my father.

825
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,170
But what exactly was your purpose for doing this?

826
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,520
Is it the same as when you sent people to attack us years ago?

827
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,840
Baili Yuan put on this father-daughter reunion show

828
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,700
simply to gain Zeng Qian's trust.

829
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,160
What is he after?

830
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,760
Zeng Qian must have something that Baili Yuan wants.

831
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,160
I've been waiting

832
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,840
for you to show your true colors.

833
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,440
I never thought

834
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,400
what you wanted was Manzhudai.

835
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:55,760
Cao Sheng.

836
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,480
You just said Zeng Qian stayed at Baili Manor

837
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,840
to kill her enemy with her own hands.

838
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,400
But can Zeng Qian really kill Baili Yuan now?

839
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,120
When hunters try to kill fierce beasts,

840
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,840
they usually set traps in advance.

841
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,680
Zeng Qian now has many opportunities to be alone with Baili Yuan.

842
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,600
I believe she can create chances for Baili Yuan to lower his guard.

843
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,680
Could she have already killed Baili Yuan?

844
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
Between her and Baili Yuan,

845
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,480
who is the hunter

846
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,400
and who is the prey?

847
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
Not necessarily.

848
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,370
You think after killing me,

849
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,440
you can leave the Baili mansion alive?

850
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,440
I never planned to leave here alive.

851
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,800
You forgot

852
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,640
what I told you.

853
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,040
I'm as good as dead already.

854
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,160
You didn't say that to him.

855
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,240
You said it to me.
