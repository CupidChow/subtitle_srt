1
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,700
Take it.

2
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,240
Hold it tight.

3
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,560
Catch!

4
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,500
Move aside!

5
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Get out of the way!

6
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,220
You dare challenge me?

7
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
I'll run you over!

8
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,960
Are you hurt?

9
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,440
You little carpenter,

10
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,160
how dare you cross me!

11
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,720
If I get injured from this fall,

12
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,850
That would be great.

13
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,840
I'd be doing everyone a favor.

14
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Everyone's lives

15
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,370
would be more peaceful.

16
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,520
So many people are watching.

17
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Don't hurt your hands beating such lowlifes.

18
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,450
Lao Che, Dongzi.

19
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,240
Come here.

20
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,050
Sorry, brother.

21
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm really sorry.

22
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
A small token.

23
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,740
Take it for your troubles.

24
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
You come here to cause trouble every few days.

25
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,120
You think throwing a few dirty bills at us makes everything okay?

26
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,980
If money could solve everything,

27
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,840
couldn't I refuse your money

28
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,480
and slap each of you instead?

29
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,120
Come on.

30
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,600
Slap me.

31
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,960
Go ahead.

32
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,040
Xie Jingtang,

33
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,079
your smugness won't last long.

34
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,840
We common folk may not be able to touch you,

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,970
but someone will put you in your place.

36
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,520
I'll be waiting.

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,440
The money!

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,970
The money's right here!

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,860
Take this money

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,480
and buy yourself a nice coffin.

41
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,680
You want to die?

42
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,660
I'll grant your wish sooner or later.

43
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,760
Speaking of archery skills in our Dengzhou city...

44
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,880
Brother Xie ranks second,

45
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,720
and no one dares to claim first place.

46
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,440
Right?

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,000
Come,

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,530
let's drink to Brother Xie.

49
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,500
To Brother Xie!

50
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,000
Cheers!

51
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,650
Brother Xie.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
I need to relieve myself.

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,890
Have another drink!

54
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,760
It's you again, little carpenter.

55
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Stop right there!

56
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,580
Don't let me catch you!

57
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,120
Someone's dead!

58
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,680
Someone's dead!

59
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,480
Someone's dead!

60
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,640
Midnight, everything was peaceful.

61
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,020
Don't misunderstand.

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
I didn't kill this person.

63
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,080
He was already like this when I got here.

64
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,610
Someone can testify for me.

65
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,000
Murder!

66
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,140
Xie Jingtang killed someone!

67
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,160
Murder!

68
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,680
Do you know?

69
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,720
This lake is called Mirror Lake.

70
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,520
Over 100 years ago, it was a city.

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,720
The final battle between Dian and Dayin took place right here.

72
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,040
More than 300,000 people

73
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,520
fought continuously for seven days and nights.

74
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,280
In the end, the Baili clan's Dian Kingdom was defeated,

75
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,810
and the city was destroyed.

76
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,560
Who would have thought that after more than 100 years,

77
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,290
this place would become a lake.

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
How things change with time.

79
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
With all your knowledge,

80
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,360
why don't you become a storyteller?

81
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Then you wouldn't have ended up in this situation.

82
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
What I mean is

83
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
time can change everything.

84
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,580
Maybe someday you'll realize

85
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,440
that I'm not a bad person.

86
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,400
Is that so?

87
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,039
Too bad,

88
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,500
I can't wait 100 years.

89
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,730
They fought for seven days and nights.

90
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Didn't they need to eat or sleep?

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,930
I don't know how they eat and sleep.

92
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,490
But the place where we'll eat and sleep

93
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,770
is almost there.

94
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,160
What's that floating

95
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,920
in the sky?

96
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,200
Sister,

97
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,170
that thing floating

98
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,060
in the sky, is it a city?

99
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,680
This must be the legendary mirage.

100
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,200
I know!

101
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,020
I've seen it in picture books.

102
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,130
That's air released by giant clams in the sea.

103
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,320
It's a unique phenomenon created by light and air.

104
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,680
Ancient books have many descriptions of it.

105
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,010
But seeing it in person,

106
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,770
still feels quite magical.

107
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,860
Why aren't the people here

108
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,720
surprised by this at all?

109
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,920
Class B.

110
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,720
Night Ghost.

111
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
Charges:

112
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
robbery

113
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,280
and theft.

114
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,370
Knows martial arts.

115
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
Skilled in lightness kung fu.

116
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,730
Usually operates at night.

117
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,840
Has a scar through left eyebrow.

118
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,480
Axin.

119
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,360
That character is pronounced 'xiao'.

120
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,240
Night Xiao.

121
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Read the right side of the character.

122
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,040
Grade B.

123
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,480
A petty thief has the same rank as me.

124
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,880
And the bounty is so high.

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,260
He knows martial arts.

126
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,250
Talking big doesn't count.

127
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,680
Excuse me.

128
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,320
A life for a life. Punish the murderer.

129
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,840
Quack doctors harm people.

130
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,760
Xie Jingtang disregards human life and deserves no mercy.

131
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,820
Those who shield killers will face divine punishment.

132
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
A serial killer.

133
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
Two lives.

134
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,560
Xie Jingtang deserves to die.

135
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,640
Why are they shouting again?

136
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh my goodness.

137
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,240
Why did you come out?

138
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,720
Hide! Quick, hide!

139
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,360
I heard them talking about killing two people.

140
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,480
I can tolerate them accusing me of killing that carpenter,

141
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,120
but what's this about another life?

142
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,000
They're probably talking about that patient who died under your care.

143
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,960
I know.

144
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,740
They're digging up ancient history now.

145
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,400
Besides,

146
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,760
that person's death had nothing to do with my medicine.

147
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Yes, yes.

148
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,280
What's past

149
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,520
is past.

150
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,050
Let's focus on this carpenter situation now.

151
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,010
Can you please hide for a while?

152
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Why should I hide?

153
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,160
I didn't kill anyone.

154
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
When I went there that night,

155
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,640
the carpenter was already dead.

156
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,760
I didn't kill him!

157
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,880
Strange signs in the sky. There's injustice on earth.

158
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,880
Those who shield murderers

159
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
will face divine punishment.

160
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,810
Who told you to go around in the streets with all these people

161
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,880
saying I was going to kill someone?

162
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,210
Later that person died.

163
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,720
You were nearby,

164
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,090
with the victim's blood on your hands.

165
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,360
What do you call this?

166
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,600
It's like being caught red-handed.

167
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,840
Even if it's not shit, it's still shit!

168
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
The problem is

169
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
this mirage in the sky has appeared at the worst possible time.

170
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,560
When common folks encounter things like this,

171
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,280
they love to make a big fuss about it.

172
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,480
I thought

173
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,560
when a mirage appears,

174
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,880
it only lasts about an incense stick's burning time?

175
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,680
Yes, indeed.

176
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,160
That's precisely what makes it so strange.

177
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,040
Ever since this case happened,

178
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,400
it has just been there,

179
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,720
for three days and nights,

180
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,960
without disappearing.

181
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,720
That one-eyed little beggar can prove my innocence.

182
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,580
I must find him.

183
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,300
I'm asking you, Clerk,

184
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960
have you found him or not?

185
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,930
We've been searching for two days now.

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
He must be hiding somewhere.

187
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,600
Besides,

188
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,400
with so many people causing trouble at the county office,

189
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,130
we don't have enough manpower.

190
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,320
Got it!

191
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,490
Where are you going?

192
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,280
Father, I have an idea.

193
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,700
Back to the inn.

194
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,890
How will you get out?

195
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
I may not be able to leave,

196
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,800
but the Clerk can.

197
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,560
Have you forgotten my special skill?

198
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,960
A life for a life.

199
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,200
Everyone, please calm down.

200
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,240
Calm down.

201
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,080
Excuse me.

202
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,560
Calm down.

203
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,180
Gentlemen,

204
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,880
I'm sorry,

205
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,700
our little shop is closed.

206
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,760
But the sun is still high.

207
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,400
I'm sorry,

208
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,560
we only serve drinks here,

209
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,520
no lodging.

210
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,360
Drinks.

211
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,760
Lodging.

212
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,080
Sis, he's doing it on purpose.

213
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,760
No,

214
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,840
Axin.

215
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Let's go.

216
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,600
Okay.

217
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,720
Young lady, give us seven vegetable buns.

218
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,640
That's 21 wen.

219
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,240
One, two, three, four.

220
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Five, six, seven.

221
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,520
Here are your seven buns.

222
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,940
Where are the buns?

223
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,520
They're right here.

224
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,580
Can't you see them?

225
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,060
Young lady,

226
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,770
are you making fun of us?

227
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,880
Please give us seven vegetable buns.

228
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,360
Then please give me 21 wen.

229
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,680
Didn't we already pay you?

230
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,160
Sister, people here are so dishonest.

231
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,600
Young lady,

232
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,320
who taught you to do business like this?

233
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,460
Are you her parent?

234
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,800
We came to buy buns,

235
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
not to play house with your child.

236
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,000
That's 21 coins in total.

237
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,930
Give us seven more vegetable buns.

238
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,280
Here's my money.

239
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Your buns should be here too, right?

240
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,460
Where's the money?

241
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,920
It's in the bag.

242
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,849
Can't you see it?

243
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,780
How about this?

244
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,819
Answer a few questions for me,

245
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,730
and all this money is yours.

246
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,500
I know what you want to ask.

247
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,130
You're looking for a place to stay,

248
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,290
but no one is willing to take you in.

249
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,260
When you entered the city,

250
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,260
did you take down a wanted poster?

251
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,880
To catch the Yexiao on it?

252
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,720
This news has spread all over town.

253
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,600
He's a thief.

254
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,160
I'm a registered bounty hunter for the Ministry of Justice.

255
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,680
I help catch thieves.

256
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,800
Is there a problem with that?

257
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,160
For us common folk,

258
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,760
Yexiao is not a thief.

259
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,680
He only steals from the heartless rich,

260
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,680
and gives the money to the poor.

261
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,440
So if you want to catch him,

262
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,620
you're going against everyone in this city.

263
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
It seems this Yexiao

264
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,560
is quite the noble thief.

265
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,540
Is a noble thief not still a thief?

266
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,800
Since you're being so straightforward,

267
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,330
I'll tell you about a place.

268
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,880
You can stay there.

269
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,240
Sir,

270
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
won't you have a few more drinks?

271
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,720
No more.

272
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm not drunk.

273
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,680
Take care then.

274
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,900
Guests!

275
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,520
You've finally arrived!

276
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,180
Careful, careful.

277
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,960
Food, drinks, rooms, hot water -

278
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
everything is ready for you.

279
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
This way, please.

280
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,280
That's impressive!

281
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,010
How did you know we were coming?

282
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
Everyone who takes down that wanted poster

283
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,960
eventually ends up here.

284
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,370
Watch your step.

285
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,920
Catching thieves

286
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,280
is the right thing to do.

287
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,380
We common folk fully support you.

288
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,400
Finally found someone who hates Yexiao.

289
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,260
It seems the owner behind this inn

290
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,980
is no ordinary person.

291
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,370
You're quite compassionate, sir.

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,600
Master Hu,

293
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,180
your table is here.

294
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,840
Waiter!

295
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,290
The wine is here.

296
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,400
Enjoy your meal, gentlemen.

297
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,860
Master San.

298
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,460
Master San is here.

299
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,240
This way, sir.

300
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,170
Did you see that?

301
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,800
Boss,

302
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,120
three more heroes have arrived.

303
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,400
What heroes?

304
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,880
Look carefully.

305
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,200
My sister is a girl.

306
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,680
Axin,

307
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
just ignore them.

308
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,720
They're doing it on purpose.

309
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
A woman?

310
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,320
And she's got skills.

311
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,920
I've never seen a female bounty hunter before.

312
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,520
Hey buddy,

313
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,250
did you just pick up that badge?

314
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,360
If you're going to pick one up,

315
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
at least get something better than the lowest wooden badge.

316
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,680
We bronze badge bounty hunters

317
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,640
would step on wooden badges

318
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,740
and find them uncomfortable.

319
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,800
What's wrong with a wooden badge?

320
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,360
My sister is a legitimate bounty hunter for the Ministry of Justice.

321
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,240
She's registered.

322
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,360
Her name is Zeng Qian.

323
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,520
Don't believe me? Go check for yourselves.

324
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,760
Is that so?

325
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,520
Look at this delicate skin.

326
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,720
How could she catch criminals?

327
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,920
Using her looks?

328
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,840
I say why not hand the criminal over to us?

329
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,400
As for you,

330
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,480
go home and nurse your baby.

331
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,010
Why should we give you our captured criminal?

332
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,560
This young person is so naive.

333
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,120
Did your body grow too fast

334
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,050
while your brain couldn't keep up?

335
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,320
Think about it.

336
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
If you hand over the criminal to me,

337
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,460
you can go home and be a baby again.

338
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,520
What's this?

339
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,180
Got quite a temper, don't you?

340
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,840
That bronze badge on your waist must be something you picked up.

341
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,960
You can't even hold your knife steady.

342
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,890
Do you need to go home for some milk?

343
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,400
This kid's got skills.

344
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,280
Nice moves.

345
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,480
What excellent archery!

346
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,290
What incredible strength!

347
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,200
We haven't had such an amazing performance here in ages.

348
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
It's absolutely spectacular.

349
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,960
All drinks today

350
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,120
It's on me.

351
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,000
Thank you, young master.

352
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
Let me introduce myself.

353
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,200
I am Xie Jingtang.

354
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,560
I own this Qingfeng House.

355
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,880
And I'm the murderer you've all been talking about.

356
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,680
But I swear to heaven,

357
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,760
I truly did not kill that man.

358
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,120
When I arrived at the alley that night,

359
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,920
the man was already dead.

360
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,600
The only witness

361
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
was a beggar.

362
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,330
He had one eye

363
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,160
and wore an eye patch.

364
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,960
But he ran away,

365
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,360
and I haven't found him yet.

366
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,320
I know

367
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,400
all you heroes

368
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,320
are here to catch Yexiao.

369
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,360
But Yexiao is worth very little,

370
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,020
and he knows martial arts.

371
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,970
Whoever helps me find that little beggar,

372
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,200
I'll pay

373
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
1,000 taels.

374
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,090
That's a lot!

375
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,100
This is 1,000 taels we're talking about.

376
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,320
Come, everyone.

377
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,760
Take a look.

378
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,760
Give me one.

379
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,020
Here you go.

380
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,080
Brother,

381
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,560
give me one too.

382
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,560
What everyone has now

383
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
is a portrait of that little beggar.

384
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,340
I've asked around.

385
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,960
People call him Little One-Eye.

386
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,480
So I trouble all you heroes

387
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
to put some effort into this.

388
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,800
Sister, look.

389
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,880
We have two copies now.

390
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,680
Sir.

391
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
This way, please.

392
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,170
Let's go.

393
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,300
Walking 60 miles every day for two days straight

394
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
while you two ride horses,

395
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,200
I've been walking so much my bones are about to fall apart.

396
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,320
Since this boss is being so generous today,

397
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,560
and you'll surely help him find that beggar,

398
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,160
why not ask for one more room?

399
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,180
Just let me sleep in a bed for one night, will you?

400
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,720
How could I possibly escape with these heavy chains on me?

401
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,020
Don't you dare underestimate yourself.

402
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,560
The Baifang River Dam was so solid,

403
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,440
yet you, Cao Sheng, single-handedly

404
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,000
blew it up in just one night.

405
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,520
How on earth did he manage to do that?

406
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,880
Did you call down lightning from the sky?

407
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Then it should have struck him dead first.

408
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,090
After causing such terrible harm.

409
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,920
What's your plan next?

410
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,960
Is it to continue hunting for that Ye Xiao?

411
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,840
Or to find that beggar for Xie Jingtang?

412
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,260
Why are you asking so many questions?

413
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,000
Rest assured.

414
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,900
Nothing will delay sending you back to the Ministry of Justice for trial.

415
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,440
Sister.

416
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,320
Why don't we go find that beggar instead?

417
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,480
I think...

418
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,720
Everyone seems to like this Ye Xiao.

419
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,240
He's a good person.

420
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,840
We only catch bad people.

421
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Not good ones.

422
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,760
Sis-

423
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,280
Sister.

424
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,800
What's wrong?

425
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,850
Nothing.

426
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,040
Let's do it this way then.

427
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,400
Let's find the beggar

428
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,640
and forget about catching the Ye Yao.

429
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,370
Sounds good.

430
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,290
We need to hurry though.

431
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,160
Many people are looking for him.

432
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,210
You're back.

433
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,280
Been busy all afternoon?

434
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,780
What did I tell you?

435
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,480
Street beggars aren't that easy to find.

436
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,200
Do you know what it means to plan before acting?

437
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,840
Young man,

438
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,370
you're a bit too impatient.

439
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,080
Mr. Hu is recovering quite quickly.

440
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,640
Ma.

441
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,080
But it's getting dark now,

442
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,720
and you don't seem ready to start working.

443
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,840
Brother, I

444
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,300
don't have your patience.

445
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,840
If I'm lucky tonight

446
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,370
and find that person first,

447
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,890
please understand.

448
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,280
Alright.

449
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,960
Then I wish you success, Ma Jindao.

450
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,620
I appreciate your kind words.

451
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,320
You also went looking for the one-eyed little beggar.

452
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,920
Waste of time.

453
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,480
Huzi,

454
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,160
today I'll teach you a trick or two.

455
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,920
That little beggar

456
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,930
has probably gone into hiding.

457
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,320
Let me ask you.

458
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,760
Who knows beggars best?

459
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,480
Who?

460
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,520
Well, of course.

461
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,600
Of course they're beggars.

462
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,240
I've already paid some of their people to be my informants.

463
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,770
As soon as there's any news,

464
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,440
we'll be the first to know.

465
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,680
Waiter, bring some wine!

466
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,540
Can you watch where you're going?

467
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,240
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,640
Sister.

469
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,520
Why don't

470
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,880
you take the bed

471
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,760
and I'll sleep on the floor.

472
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,640
The bed is too soft.

473
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm not used to it.

474
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,200
Axin.

475
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,840
I'm going out for a while.

476
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,680
Stay in the room and read.

477
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,210
Go to sleep if you get tired.

478
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,360
Sister.

479
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,040
Are you going to find that beggar?

480
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Can I go with you?

481
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,720
No.

482
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,240
Stay in the room and keep an eye on him for me.

483
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,040
So should I read

484
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,360
or watch him?

485
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,080
If you can't fall asleep while reading,

486
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,610
I can tell you some stories.

487
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,880
Like the borrowing arrows with straw boats

488
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,200
or the burning of the linked camps.

489
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,960
Great!

490
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,560
I love listening to stories.

491
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,970
Don't talk to my brother

492
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,580
or you won't even get steamed buns next time.

493
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,360
Let's go.

494
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,680
Can you help me?

495
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,440
No.

496
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,840
At least have the waiter bring me some water.

497
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,320
Let me wash my face and clean up a bit.

498
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
I'm starting to stink all over.

499
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,120
None of you deserve to feel good.

500
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,290
It really is a bronze badge.

501
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,120
My apologies.

502
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,400
I stopped you because there are too many demon hunters lately

503
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
who heard about the theft at our mansion

504
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,410
and came looking for clues.

505
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,000
So our master made a rule

506
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,400
that only hunters with bronze badges or higher are allowed in.

507
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,000
Those with wooden or iron badges cannot enter.

508
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
I was careless

509
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,340
and seeing you're a young lady, I just...

510
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,680
You thought I wasn't worthy of a bronze badge.

511
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,880
I've been disrespectful.

512
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,920
Please forgive me.

513
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,780
Please come in.

514
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,280
Though your name, Wang Hu, is quite unusual.

515
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,120
My father raised me like a boy since I was little.

516
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,650
This way.

517
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,760
That night we found Yexiao in this courtyard.

518
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,720
He had already stolen our master's silver.

519
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,360
Three or four of us guards couldn't catch him.

520
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,600
He came at us with a kick.

521
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,400
Then a left punch, a right punch.

522
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,780
This kick was from Yexiao, wasn't it?

523
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,810
You guys wouldn't have this kind of strength.

524
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,640
Guard Ding.

525
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,160
What are you doing so late at night?

526
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,960
Young master.

527
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,080
This is the new criminal investigator from the Ministry of Justice.

528
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,680
Here to help us catch Yexiao.

529
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,840
And it's a female investigator.

530
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,000
This wasn't damaged by him.

531
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:44,920
Right.

532
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,040
This must have been kicked by one of our own.

533
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,240
No.

534
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,820
It was hit with a stick.

535
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,840
Are there any newly opened pharmacies in town?

536
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,720
The broken railing and this water vat here

537
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,560
both have the smell of camphor oil.

538
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,040
Dogs are very sensitive to this smell.

539
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
That's why it was sneezing earlier.

540
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,360
These two spots in the courtyard have the strongest camphor oil smell.

541
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,440
It must have come from Yexiao's shoes.

542
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,680
According to everyone's description,

543
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,960
Yexiao has excellent lightness skills, moving across rooftops with ease.

544
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,040
The camphor oil on his shoes

545
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,370
most likely comes from a pharmacy's roof.

546
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,400
Because pharmacies brew camphor oil,

547
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
which forms residue on the roof.

548
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,200
But why a newly opened pharmacy?

549
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,280
Old pharmacies have aged oil residue on their roofs,

550
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,480
but this clearly smells like fresh oil.

551
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,240
Chunfeng Lane in the west of the city.

552
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,640
There is a pharmacy that opened a month ago.

553
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,880
Then we'll arrange people to hide on the pharmacy roof

554
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,520
and catch him when he appears next time.

555
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,400
But how can we be sure that place

556
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,730
will definitely be on his route next time?

557
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,400
He travels across rooftops firstly to avoid being seen

558
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,680
and secondly to take the shortest route.

559
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,140
So he'll take this straight line.

560
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,240
Your residence is here.

561
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,280
The pharmacy in Chunfeng Lane should be here.

562
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,200
Based on this,

563
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,060
he must live near Luoxi River west of Chunfeng Lane.

564
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Because beyond that is the city wall.

565
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,290
And from what I know,

566
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,280
most wealthy people in Dengzhou live in the east side,

567
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,080
so he must pass through Chunfeng Lane to come here.

568
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,400
But if I were Ye Xiao,

569
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,410
I would have realized this oversight.

570
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,520
Next time,

571
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,770
I would avoid the pharmacy.

572
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,760
Then we'll set up an ambush throughout Chunfeng Lane.

573
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,220
That's quite a large area.

574
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,560
We don't have enough men.

575
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,170
Besides,

576
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,700
too many people would be easily spotted.

577
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,080
All we need

578
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,800
is one useful person.

579
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,930
Something's not right.

580
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,200
Why can't I smell any camphor oil?

581
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,140
Who might you be, miss?

582
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,620
You flatter me.

583
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
I'm just a hunter.

584
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,420
Qianji Guards will only stay in Dengzhou for one night.

585
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,500
But this is our best chance to rescue Father.

586
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,260
I met Cao Zhong yesterday.

587
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,920
He actually arrived here two months ago

588
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,880
and secretly brought in a large amount of gunpowder.

589
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,560
I know.

590
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,690
Let's go see him now.

591
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,160
How did you get up here?

592
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,360
I thought you didn't know martial arts.

593
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,080
I know how to use a ladder.

594
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,490
But you could see everything from down there.

595
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,440
It's just that you martial artists

596
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,040
are always jumping onto rooftops.

597
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,000
So I thought

598
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,560
I'd come up and see what's so special about it.

599
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,820
And what's different?

600
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
Down there, my legs don't feel weak.

601
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,440
Young Master.

602
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,280
Zhong.

603
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,240
These are the tunnels we dug beneath Dengzhou City.

604
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,500
They're now complete.

605
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,880
The gunpowder has been placed at the tunnel entrance connected to the canal.

606
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,960
Once we blow up this connection point,

607
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,960
the water will flow through the tunnels into the city.

608
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,800
We've also placed explosives at several key positions in the tunnels inside the city.

609
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,130
Once they all detonate,

610
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,610
the water will surge out

611
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
and flood the entire Dengzhou City.

612
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,240
The timing remains the same?

613
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,320
We'll proceed at the Hour of the Tiger tonight.

614
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,200
By then, all citizens should be sound asleep.

615
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,800
This will ensure

616
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,120
no one is missed,

617
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,370
no one survives.

618
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,980
What about you all?

619
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,000
Most of our brothers have already withdrawn.

620
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,730
The rest of us are here to detonate the gunpowder.

621
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,400
Our lives were given to us by our master.

622
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,640
We follow our master without regret.

623
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
But young master,

624
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,880
you must leave before the Hour of the Tiger.
