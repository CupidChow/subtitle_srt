1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,000
Grandma

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Isn't this enough?

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,980
Why are you still kneading dough?

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,000
It’s for tomorrow.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,520
Mr. Xie, this inn

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,680
is good.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,040
The buns are not good

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,010
The customers always complain

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,160
We eat their food and live here

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,840
We don't do anything.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
It's embarrassing.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,480
Let's cook some food for them

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,920
so that the customers

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,080
complain less.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,040
It's a token of our gratitude.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,200
Grandma.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,000
You're so thoughtful.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,840
You've been standing here for a long time.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,100
You didn't help at all.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Madam

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,460
Call me sister.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Tong Tong, watch your mouth.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,280
It sounds like the girl from last time.

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,560
I knocked over the teapot last time.

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920
you helped me, right?

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,319
Yes.

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,440
Madam.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,000
Call me sister.

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,120
Tong Tong.

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,120
Don't be so rude.

31
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,360
Tong Tong.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,680
Are the buns ready?

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,320
Send it to your father.

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,880
Okay.

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,490
Let's make a deal first.

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,920
After you finish your work,

37
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,200
I will kill King of Jingnan

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
and avenge my father.

39
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Do you have a plan?

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,360
Not yet.

41
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
But there will be.

42
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,780
Don't stop me then.

43
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,240
But you have to help me.

44
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,840
What do you mean?

45
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,880
Will you help me?

46
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,720
The food I made for you

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,479
Don't choke.

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,759
You...

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,920
No.

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,200
You might not be a kid.

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,440
Are you an old man?

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,160
Uncle Fu came to me this time

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,290
with some of my father's manuscripts.

54
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,880
Your father has broken off with He Xiguang for so many years.

55
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,340
Is your father's manuscript related to him?

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,760
My father was chased by He Xiguang's fangs.

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,690
It means they've been in a relationship these years.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,680
But there are still strange symbols

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,079
in those manuscripts.

60
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,280
To figure out the specific meaning,

61
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,770
we have to rely on Tong Tong.

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,200
Explain to us.

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
It's knowledgeable.

64
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,100
This is the same as his previous manuscript.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,960
Nothing special.

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,720
It records

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,000
are mostly daily chores.

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,320
If it's just daily chores

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,240
why do you use such a special word?

70
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,960
Although Cao Jiande learned your handwriting,

71
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,160
he still

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,329
the old characters on our side.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,960
Just like how he called the robot man

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,160
called Kiba.

75
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,160
It sounds strange.

76
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,040
But the pronunciation of your teeth

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,370
Read it together. Clip.

78
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,600
Over there

79
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,320
the real name of a robot.

80
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
Slave Warrior.

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,800
Since you said

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
are just some daily matters,

83
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,860
Then pick one or two

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Tell me.

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,090
On the fifth day of December last year,

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
in Shenzhou,

87
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,960
in Shenzhou.

88
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,220
and was wanted by the government.

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,850
You asked your father for help.

90
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,640
But he was chased by the Guard.

91
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,970
and had no time to worry.

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,640
You're wrong.

93
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,720
I blew up the dam on the fifth day of November.

94
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,519
You lied to me.

95
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,360
It says December.

96
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,760
You lied to me.

97
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,960
Is there

98
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,840
a man named He Xiguang

99
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,720
or about the ore.

100
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,159
It's useless.

101
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,020
She treats me like she treats you.

102
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,680
Yunniang said

103
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,560
she might be an old man.

104
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,200
Auntie Ji.

105
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Six more dishes.

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,360
No more

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,120
No

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,480
There are many guests waiting outside.

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,400
Aunt Ji,

110
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,730
prepare more tomorrow.

111
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Our boss said

112
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
the money we make is on you.

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,600
No, no.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,760
We live here for free.

115
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,800
We can't take advantage of you anymore.

116
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,440
How many customers have you made for us?

117
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,860
We should be taking advantage of you.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,280
I'll go down and make arrangements.

119
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,640
OK. OK.

120
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,120
Okay.

121
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,480
Grandma.

122
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
You're amazing

123
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Now everyone only eats food.

124
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,930
We won't complain about buns anymore.

125
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Tong Tong.

126
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,200
Don’t say that in front of Mr. Xie.

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Mr. Xie said that himself.

128
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,600
Look.

129
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,240
My buns

130
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,800
is not that bad.

131
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm not that particular about food.

132
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,400
I have no taste.

133
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,960
Let's talk about something else.

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,680
You've been keeping an eye on Tong Tong these days.

135
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,720
You've been inseparable.

136
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,240
I'm just bored.

137
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,880
and find something to do.

138
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Actually, look at Tong's work.

139
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,840
anyone can do it.

140
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,640
I know what you want to say.

141
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,320
It's true that I killed Yoo Gwan-young.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
Last time in the kitchen,

143
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,520
Feng Buwei let me go.

144
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,200
But this

145
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,040
won't end like this.

146
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Are you worried that I'll get too close to Tong Tong and Aunt Ji?

147
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
It won't hurt the scene.

148
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,600
You may kill me anytime.

149
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,200
You want to do something you can.

150
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,480
to get the real Tong back.

151
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
I understand.

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,290
This is a kind of compensation.

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Make up for it?

154
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
What can I make up for?

155
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,680
Nothing.

156
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
I never expect Feng Buyan to understand me.

157
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,840
Forgive me.

158
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,880
Even if I help find Tong Tong,

159
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,320
he should kill me.

160
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,240
If it were me,

161
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,159
I would do the same.

162
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
So...

163
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,840
I know what I'm doing is meaningless.

164
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,400
I just think

165
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,200
I should do this.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,660
He should do what he should do.

167
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
I do what I should do.

168
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
That's all.

169
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
All these years,

170
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,560
I've never done anything I want to do.

171
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
It's rare that

172
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,360
I think

173
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,320
good.

174
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
What's the matter?

175
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,840
You said your dishes

176
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,770
are not very popular on the street.

177
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,160
But I have

178
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,520
to me.

179
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,800
It's just

180
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,600
compared.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,460
I don't mean to be jealous.

182
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,120
I just have an idea.

183
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,720
From now on, you'll work in Qingfeng Pavilion.

184
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,400
and make less money.

185
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,040
Look at Auntie Ji.

186
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,370
I feel so accomplished.

187
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,680
I think Auntie Ji likes staying here.

188
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,840
She's always happy.

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,520
It's up to her.

190
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,840
That's right.

191
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,080
Look forward

192
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
should move on.

193
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,320
There will always be new choices and new lives.

194
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
We can't always think about the past.

195
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,840
Right?

196
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Let bygones be bygones.

197
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,560
In the past few days,

198
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,120
Lin Han didn't rest well

199
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,080
[Lin Han didn't rest well.]

200
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
and did my best.

201
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,800
She must know

202
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,560
I did something wrong back then, so...

203
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,090
It's between me and Lin Han.

204
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,640
[between me and Lin Han.]

205
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,760
Are you really afraid that I'll get lost?

206
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,520
You'll follow me wherever you go.

207
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Don't be so polite to me.

208
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,800
You two...

209
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,360
Grandma.

210
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,240
I want to buy a sugar man.

211
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,640
Okay.

212
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,840
Go.

213
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,920
Miss.

214
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,680
Have a sugar man.

215
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,200
Boss.

216
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
How much is it?

217
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,920
Six cents for one.

218
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,440
I'm innocent.

219
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,240
Granny.

220
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,040
I have money.

221
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,100
One penny less, right?

222
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,880
Which one do you want?

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,560
This one.

224
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,720
Okay.

225
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,160
Okay.

226
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,880
Grandma.

227
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,000
I bought it.

228
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,320
It's done.

229
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,960
Let's go.

230
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,720
Okay.

231
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,170
Give me the note.

232
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,440
You don't have to go with me today.

233
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,040
But you have to think it over.

234
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,680
People can wait.

235
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,560
but time waits for no one.

236
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Do you know how to contact me?

237
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,920
I thought

238
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
their contact information was.

239
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,050
Did you see the content on the note?

240
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't have a chance.

241
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,080
to stop the sugar seller.

242
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,560
Bao sent a message

243
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,600
he's already targeting the sugar seller.

244
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,730
Lin Han is on his way.

245
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,480
My plan is

246
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,720
need your teeth.

247
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,780
Write some words on their side for me.

248
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,960
Smart.

249
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,640
You have He Xiguang's secret service.

250
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,170
is better than that.

251
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,120
Where is the handwriting?

252
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,920
You have to imitate your father.

253
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,290
I'll tell you the story.

254
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,040
Ask your teeth to write it down.

255
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,200
I'll copy it again.

256
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,040
Their handwriting is very similar to the drawing.

257
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,520
I can draw.

258
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,880
Young Master.

259
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,680
The word you asked the Armored Monster to write

260
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,960
is almost the same as the manuscript left by the owner.

261
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,520
It's completely fake.

262
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,000
So Tong Tong couldn't see any flaws last night.

263
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,400
But how did you know

264
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,800
that the Armored Monster would write this?

265
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,120
We searched for people outside for days.

266
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,280
Many of them didn't know these characters.

267
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,340
When we interrogated Wang Hu,

268
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,120
he said it was an abandoned letter.

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,480
Only those

270
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,200
who can read these words.

271
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,260
except those who are knowledgeable.

272
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,520
They have the teeth.

273
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,000
It's called Slave Warrior.

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,260
You're a lowly person.

275
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,560
This is what's written on that note.

276
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,680
I copied it.

277
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,240
Where is the sugar seller?

278
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,040
He's not dead.

279
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,560
Bag is watching.

280
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,290
He confessed after a while.

281
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,530
He said the news was sent to He Xiguang.

282
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,400
I asked him to send the original to you as usual.

283
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
It's not good.

284
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Just wait and see.

285
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,040
It's not about the drawing.

286
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
I can't understand it at all.

287
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,400
Unless...

288
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,120
go to Wuji Temple again

289
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
to find that robot monster.

290
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,920
No need.

291
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,810
I don't know anything else.

292
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
These are

293
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,540
What are they writing?

294
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,780
It's complicated.

295
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,480
But what matters is

296
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,680
I'll give you a place.

297
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,240
that there is a ore there.

298
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
He told me after he finished it.

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,360
I remember them.

300
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,360
If I remember these correctly,

301
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,940
the address of the ore.

302
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,120
Fengxia Hill.

303
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,920
Jaam-dong.

304
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,880
When I was in that shabby yard,

305
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,000
He Xiguang mentioned

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,260
He has something Tong Tong really needs.

307
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,080
He Xiguang needs the ore.

308
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,520
As long as Tong Tong has the clues of the ore,

309
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,160
he will definitely make a deal with He Xiguang.

310
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,360
To catch He Xiguang,

311
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
we have to use the ore as bait.

312
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,760
We can just let He Xiguang know

313
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,520
to He Xiguang.

314
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,120
Why did you use Tong Tong? It's easy.

315
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,360
It's easy to spread the news,

316
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,760
But how can I convince He Xiguang?

317
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,560
That's hard.

318
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,560
You told King of Jingnan that Tong Tong works better than the secret service

319
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,960
because Tong Tong doesn't know she's a spy.

320
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,160
Only in this way

321
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,200
can make He Xiguang believe it.

322
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,080
That means

323
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,960
when He Xiguang gets this note,

324
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,400
he’ll go to the Jaam Cave of Fengxia Hill.

325
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,560
Then we can just go there for ambush.

326
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Cao Sheng asked me to write these words.

327
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,800
King of Jingnan naturally knows this address.

328
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,660
He might have sent someone there.

329
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,600
Didn't King Jingnan say

330
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
to leave this matter to us?

331
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,040
If we can catch He Xiguang,

332
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,760
he can do

333
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,920
what we can do.

334
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,680
And I think

335
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,810
he trusts himself more.

336
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
If He Xiguang falls into his hands,

337
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,880
even if he breaks his promise,

338
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,410
we can't do anything to him.

339
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,440
Let's go now.

340
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,720
Young master.

341
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,400
Don't go with Xie Jingtang.

342
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,800
Don't drag us down.

343
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,240
Yun.

344
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,400
Here is the thing.

345
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,520
But it hurts

346
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
it hurts.

347
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,920
My lord.

348
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,770
I heard you play the flute well.

349
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
How about this one?

350
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,880
I'll show you.

351
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,620
I didn't ask you to blow it.

352
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,000
Don't you know what we're doing?

353
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,160
Sir.

354
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,060
We're here.

355
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,540
Buam-dong is right ahead.

356
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,860
It's a trap.

357
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,240
Go!

358
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,840
Get the horse ready.

359
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,500
After them!

360
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,850
Sir, there's no road ahead.

361
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,840
Go that way.

362
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Why did you kill him?

363
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,440
I didn't want to kill him.

364
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,480
He's too weak.

365
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,330
Let's go.

366
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,960
Go.

367
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,560
Can you reach it?

368
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,490
Still shooting?

369
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,600
He's not responding.

370
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,040
So rude.

371
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,580
You didn't hit a single arrow.

372
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,640
You did it on purpose

373
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,960
Didn't you see so many arrows on the ground?

374
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,880
Pick it up.

375
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,480
What a waste.

376
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
That means

377
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,440
He Xiguang will go to Fengxia Cave

378
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,680
he’ll go to the Jaam Cave of Fengxia Hill.

379
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,000
Then we can just go there.

380
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,880
Cao Sheng asked Kiba to write these words.

381
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,000
King of Jingnan naturally knows this address.

382
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,680
He might have sent someone there.

383
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,610
If He Xiguang falls into his hands,

384
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
even if he breaks his promise,

385
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,530
we can't do anything to him.

386
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,400
Let's go.

387
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,200
Young master.

388
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,640
Don't go with Xie Jingtang.

389
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,700
Don't drag us down.

390
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,240
No hurry.

391
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,250
He Xiguang didn't come so soon.

392
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
According to the sources of sugar seller,

393
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,160
this news was sent to He Xiguang,

394
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,210
the destination is Baili Mansion.

395
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,000
It means He Xiguang is still in Baili Mansion.

396
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,440
He Xiguang needs some time

397
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,800
to come back.

398
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
You just stepped into Hell with one foot.

399
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Got it?

400
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,400
Sorry.

401
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,260
Did I scare you?

402
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,160
How is it?

403
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,920
My fake hair is not bad, right?

404
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm going to make a special dress.

405
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,520
As long as Lin Han hits me into the grass,

406
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,200
I can shrink my head into my clothes

407
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,320
and then put my head in.

408
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,560
Then Lin Han's backhand

409
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,240
this fake head

410
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,120
will fall into the river.

411
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,720
The biggest problem now

412
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,980
is not how to get rid of He Xiguang,

413
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,760
but after he is eliminated,

414
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,290
will King of Jingnan fulfill his promise?

415
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,640
Will he let Tong

416
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,100
and the soul of Zeng Xin back to their bodies.

417
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,440
So we're going to put on a fake act.

418
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,080
Try it.

419
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
King of Jingnan's sincerity

420
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Indeed

421
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,960
King of Jingnan is not sincere.

422
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,160
When he saw He Xiguang died,

423
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,440
he killed us immediately.

424
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,680
Kill the donkey.

425
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
What did you apply to me?

426
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,170
It's so hard to wipe.

427
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,720
Bao.

428
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,080
This is yours.

429
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,640
Dirty.

430
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,600
It's OK if Bao doesn't look good

431
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,700
King of Jingnan doesn't know him.

432
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,960
He asked for it.

433
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,080
I'm so handsome.

434
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,600
I'm so handsome.

435
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,730
who doesn't forget my beautiful face?

436
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,440
If he recognizes me,

437
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,080
how am I supposed to survive in Tongzhou?

438
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
This is how you use your unparalleled face.

439
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,320
Let's not talk about this.

440
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,800
Tell me if there was something wrong with the fight just now.

441
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,860
You hit me too hard.

442
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,360
I didn't follow the rehearsal.

443
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,560
I did a few more moves.

444
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,520
No.

445
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,000
It was too fast.

446
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,240
You were beheaded

447
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,560
you'll be beheaded.

448
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,960
If you cut my head,

449
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,560
I have to jump into the river.

450
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,640
My Iron Palm.

451
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,200
and strong King Kong legs.

452
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,760
I didn't have time to use it.

453
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,340
Let's go, guys.

454
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,860
You can go back as you come.

455
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,560
This is professional.

456
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
You used me again.

457
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,840
You're exaggerating.

458
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,760
We just helped you a lot

459
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,200
that you didn't know.

460
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,000
I have nothing to use now.

461
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,360
Why do you want me here?

462
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,280
Are you here to see those people?

463
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,880
King of Jingnan can’t be trusted now.

464
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,280
Our only hope is Baili Yuan.

465
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,160
His teeth should be of help.

466
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,740
You know He Xiguang very well.

467
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
Please help us.

468
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,200
Aren’t you familiar with Baili Yuan?

469
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,000
You don’t need me.

470
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,520
Do you mind working with He Xiguang?

471
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,980
I can tell from your conversation last time.

472
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,770
What's your relationship?

473
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,250
We're like friends.

474
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,260
Just like enemies.

475
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,000
Anyway, he must have something you want.

476
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,480
You have clues that he wants too?

477
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,040
So what?

478
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,050
Do you think he will help you

479
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,080
if you give me to him?

480
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,360
I have no choice.

481
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,040
Are you sure?

482
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,200
you can bring me back

483
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,920
you can bring me back.

484
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,520
You don't have to come back.

485
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,640
Tong Tong is back.

486
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,200
During the time I spent with you,

487
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,560
when I was with you.

488
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,080
You came all the way here.

489
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,700
This is definitely not what you want.

490
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,280
Let me think.

491
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,160
You won't run away, will you?

492
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,480
How can I run?

493
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,080
Dog-shaped.

494
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,360
The fish is roasted well.

495
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,280
Yunniang, let me see yours.

496
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,040
What do you want?

497
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,960
Don't you know how to roast it? It's fine. It's fine.

498
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,920
None of your business.

499
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,440
It's burnt.

500
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,970
You're the one who's burnt.

501
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,600
Aren't you going to eat fish over there?

502
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I don't eat fish.

503
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,800
Is there a story?

504
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,420
A lot of thorns.

505
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,930
Here you go. Here you go.

506
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,760
It's not cooked yet.

507
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,960
I know.

508
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm afraid Xie Jingtang will steal mine.

509
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,380
I'll grill it here.

510
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,460
Let me help you.

511
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,280
What?

512
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,140
Are you afraid?

513
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,460
I'll throw the knife on the ground again.

514
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,840
You're not always like that.

515
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,880
In the afternoon,

516
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,960
when I went to pick up the scarf,

517
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,880
Did you think I was going to risk my life again?

518
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,800
Next time,

519
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,420
you can tell me in advance.

520
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,480
Why did you

521
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,080
when you hold a knife in your hand,

522
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,520
he becomes different.

523
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,920
And

524
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,440
when you use a knife,

525
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,040
Very fast.

526
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,460
Maybe it's because it's too fast.

527
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,090
I didn't have time to think about many things.

528
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,840
Four years ago,

529
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,010
the third year of the rebellion in the Northwest.

530
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,480
His Majesty was eager to recapture the capital.

531
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,280
so he ordered Baili Yuan to return from Liangzhou.

532
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,360
to join forces with King of Jingnan in the Wushu Mausoleum near the capital.

533
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,690
80,000 Imperial Guards

534
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,280
With the 40,000 soldiers borrowed from Liangzhou,

535
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,610
to fight against 100,000 rebels guarding there.

536
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,560
That was the worst battle I've ever fought.

537
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,160
Two hundred thousand people

538
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
[They're profound.]

539
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Step by step.

540
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,800
Fight head-on.

541
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,920
No conspiracy

542
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,480
No deception.

543
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,960
The first team is killed.

544
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,170
The other team is up.

545
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,080
Fight from sunrise to sunset

546
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,560
Not a moment of rest

547
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,159
In the end,

548
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,679
the rebels were defeated.

549
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,940
There are only thousands of people left.

550
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,060
The Royal Guards and the soldiers

551
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,440
are less than 20,000.

552
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,679
A tragic victory.

553
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,239
You know what?

554
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,179
what you fear the most on the battlefield

555
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,840
is not when we fight against each other.

556
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,000
Because the only thought at that time

557
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,159
was killing.

558
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,239
You want to live, don't you? You want to live?

559
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,840
you'll get excited at first,

560
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,840
and become numb.

561
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,719
What I fear the most is

562
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,000
you survived.

563
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,719
You're cleaning up the battlefield.

564
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,040
and saw so many corpses everywhere.

565
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,320
your brother may be lying beside your feet.

566
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
When you throw him into the pit,

567
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,720
you'll think of

568
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,650
drinking and chatting last night.

569
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,320
You can't tell which is real.

570
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,880
The Camp I was in

571
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,720
belongs to Baili Yuan.

572
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,440
is an elite.

573
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
That day,

574
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,520
[Half of the Divine Forces died in the battle.] [They were killed.]

575
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,800
The survivors

576
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,600
don't know how many people they killed.

577
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,160
All I know is

578
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,880
The blade is wrapped.

579
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,880
But my sword was as bright as before.

580
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,720
is more sharp.

581
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,480
The Hengdao I used

582
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,980
was a gift from the blacksmith who taught me kung fu.

583
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,160
He told me

584
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,560
that this is a good knife.

585
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,410
It must be a good sheath.

586
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,320
I didn't understand.

587
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,040
Since that day, I knew

588
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,210
if a good knife doesn't have a good sheath,

589
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,760
he will kill until he can't stop.

590
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,820
After the battle at Wusuling,

591
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,010
I applied to join the Mobai Capital where Gwan-young is.

592
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,200
Gwan-young doesn't understand why I did that.

593
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,560
It's hard to get promoted by scouts.

594
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,600
I told Gwan-young

595
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
I just don't want to see so many dead people.

596
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,000
So since then,

597
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,120
you used a stick.

598
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,280
No wonder you said

599
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,400
I don't know the meaning of life.

600
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,440
It’s because you’ve experienced too many deaths.

601
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,520
This trip to General Baili Yuan's residence

602
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,680
the future is uncertain.

603
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,880
It's unpredictable.

604
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,600
I plan to

605
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,840
the Hans Camp

606
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,360
back.

607
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,360
If anything happens, we can support them.

608
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,920
Since you know it's hard to predict,

609
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,250
why drag them into this?

610
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,320
They are wanted by the government.

611
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,650
They've been on the run.

612
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
Thanks to the money you gave,

613
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,040
they can settle down

614
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,720
without any worries.

615
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,720
Qianjiao is living a life of licking blood.

616
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,180
I don't know much about poetry and music.

617
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,120
I know how to repay kindness.

618
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,680
But I need some time to gather them.

619
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,640
Can you wait a little longer?

620
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,080
Let's go together.

621
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,060
King of Jingnan will leave Dengzhou in ten days.

622
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,220
Baili Yuan is our last chance.

623
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,440
We can’t wait.

624
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,240
Thank you.

625
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,120
Eating fish is also a method.

626
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,360
Don't bother.

627
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,600
Let me teach you.

628
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,040
Go to Baili Yuan Mansion.

629
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,240
I have a condition.

630
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,600
Over there.

631
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,360
Don't limit my freedom.

632
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,160
Shall we go now?

633
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,640
or wait for He Xiguang?

634
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,140
According to the estimated time,

635
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,040
He Xiguang’s men should be in Jaam-dong.

636
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
He Xiguang won’t fall for it so easily.

637
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,360
It should be his spy.

638
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,640
But I left a note in the cave.

639
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,160
He'll come to us.

640
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,260
He's already here.

641
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,320
Only two spies came.

642
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,360
Are we that untrustworthy?

643
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,480
Trust requires foundation.

644
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,760
Our foundation is not reliable.

645
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,400
Then what is reliable?

646
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,880
I know what happened to you today.

647
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,520
Your enemy is your friend.

648
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,360
That's it! That's it!

649
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,520
Not enough.

650
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,120
What?

651
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,080
buy me a fish?

652
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,480
What if we drugged him?

653
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,900
Aren't you afraid?

654
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,840
I'm scared.

655
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,900
But I'm more afraid of hunger.

656
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,800
Did you bring two people here?

657
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,930
With so many people,

658
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,480
I don't deserve to be trusted.

659
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,720
Zeng Qian.

660
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,480
I have to tie it up.

661
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,760
Don't exaggerate

662
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,440
It's a long journey.

663
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,340
It'll be dangerous if you fall asleep on the way.

664
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,170
It's better than acupuncture.

665
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,320
Don't worry.

666
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,050
It's not the first time anyway.

667
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,320
Look.

668
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,640
Be careful.

669
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,320
You have fangs.

670
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,200
you have a way.

671
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,440
What we want

672
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,400
is the real Zeng Xin.

673
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,880
You only have He Xiguang now.

674
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,760
Unless one more person is involved.

675
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,000
Baili Yuan.

676
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,480
In this way,

677
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,080
not only can I let Zeng Qian's brother

678
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,380
and Feng Buwei's daughter back to their bodies,

679
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,640
And...

680
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,800
I can send you to that city.

681
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,760
If you join them,

682
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,320
with them

683
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,280
to join the fun

684
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,980
or for the sake of justice?

685
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,560
No.

686
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,840
You have your own purpose.

687
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,920
You just want to get treatment on Mirage.

688
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,410
That disease

689
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,890
I've tormented you enough, haven't I?

690
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,460
Is your nose bleeding?

691
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,760
You don't have much time.

692
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
I'm the only person who can save you.

693
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,360
I told you.

694
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,600
I know a lot about you.

695
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,200
Your father has been struggling.

696
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,120
He has been holding a grudge against me for a long time.

697
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,600
He wants me to send you to Mirage

698
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,320
with my teeth.

699
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,940
but you want to stick to your principles.

700
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,200
so that I won't take the throne

701
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,280
to take the throne.

702
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,020
If it weren't for this reason,

703
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,040
I would have helped you.

704
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,480
But now,

705
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,160
it’s not too late.

706
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,480
That's Baili Yuan.

707
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,640
You overestimated me.

708
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,000
I can't kill him.

709
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,960
So you need a chance.

710
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,120
The first chance

711
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,360
is with He Xiguang.

712
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,240
I'll arrange someone to act with you.

713
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,570
to make him believe you.

714
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,400
I know what happened to you today.

715
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,560
The enemy of the enemy is a friend.

716
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,780
But you have to hide it from Zeng Qian and the others.

717
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,580
Because the second chance

718
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
is with Zeng Qian.

719
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,800
She

720
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,080
She is Baili Yuan’s daughter. She is
