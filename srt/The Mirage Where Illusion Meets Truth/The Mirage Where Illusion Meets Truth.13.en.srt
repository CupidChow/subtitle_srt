1
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
It's been so long.

2
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,440
He's not a loach.

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,160
He must be dead.

4
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,000
Why is only our second team left to search the mountain?

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,060
It's already dawn.

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,440
Either the Prince is dead,

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,970
or someone has rescued him from the mountain.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,260
What are you all doing?

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,980
Check if he's really dead.

10
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,320
So that's what you meant

11
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,960
by 'besieging Wei to rescue Zhao.'

12
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,040
The Prince is on the mountain,

13
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,480
and the Emperor is in Wuji Temple.

14
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,720
They know what matters most.

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,380
They know what they're doing.

16
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,290
I'm just worried Feng Buhai won't hold out until we send the signal.

17
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,920
He won't die that easily.

18
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,040
You must have heard before

19
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,440
about how I buried myself in sand

20
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,440
for two days and nights to assassinate a rebel leader.

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,680
Yes.

22
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,280
The young master checked your files

23
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,760
at the Ministry of War and did see it.

24
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,440
That was because my master secretly modified my records

25
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,240
so I could join the Qianji Guard.

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,440
He added someone else's military achievements to mine.

27
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,300
Actually, the person who buried himself in the sand

28
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,040
wasn't me,

29
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,520
but

30
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,200
Feng Buhai.

31
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,640
We need to go to the mountains again.

32
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,100
Lin Han,

33
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,380
you need to keep watching things here for me.

34
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
What's going on?

35
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,280
Just come back safely.

36
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,600
If you weren't covered in so much mud,

37
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,520
I would hug you.

38
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
This one is clean.

39
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,480
You can come over and try.

40
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,680
No, no.

41
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,480
Is there anyone still on the mountain?

42
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,740
Most of them have left.

43
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,640
Your signal flare was very timely.

44
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,800
The remaining ones,

45
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,730
we took care of them on our way down.

46
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,210
Take this to wipe your face.

47
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,560
Thank you.

48
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,159
Did you embroider this rooster?

49
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,159
That's a phoenix.

50
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll do it myself.

51
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,040
You've been stuck there all day.

52
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,140
I need to get back quickly.

53
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,400
Mother.

54
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,760
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,720
Silly child.

56
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,400
Get up.

57
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,760
Stand up.

58
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,200
I won't cry anymore, Mother.

59
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,240
Is it safe to keep him here?

60
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,880
He's been inside the house the whole time.

61
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,480
What could possibly happen?

62
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,640
Except for the people in the Taoist temple and us,

63
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,970
no one recognizes him as the Crown Prince.

64
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,320
As the Crown Prince,

65
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,400
I suppose I'm not

66
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,740
of much value to you anymore, am I?

67
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,600
Since the Emperor successfully reversed his aging,

68
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,120
you've been worthless.

69
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,400
Given the Emperor's current physical condition...

70
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,000
He still has decades to live.

71
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,170
You might not even outlive him.

72
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,300
What's the point of being Crown Prince then?

73
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Rather than this,

74
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,520
why not use you

75
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,040
to eliminate the King of Jingnan first,

76
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,640
then have you executed,

77
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,400
and pacify the King's followers.

78
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,680
What a perfect way to kill two birds with one stone.

79
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,720
No wonder those imperial guards

80
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,200
gathered at the foot of the mountain in advance,

81
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,080
just waiting for something to happen to the King of Jingnan.

82
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,520
But how can the Emperor be sure that after killing the King of Jingnan,

83
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
his followers will definitely submit

84
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,720
instead of rebelling

85
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,000
or

86
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,850
siding with Baili Yuan?

87
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,420
Life is like chess,

88
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,140
sometimes you must make risky moves.

89
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,680
You went to great lengths to bring me here,

90
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,140
surely to extract some information from me.

91
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,800
But even if I tell you,

92
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,980
it won't make any difference.

93
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,620
Then please tell us about the Emperor's rejuvenation.

94
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,440
The King of Jingnan and Baili Yuan quelled the rebellion.

95
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,960
Their achievements overshadowed the emperor.

96
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,220
My father, the emperor, was wary of them.

97
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,080
Fortunately, the King of Jingnan and Baili Yuan gradually formed a balance of power.

98
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,410
Only then could the empire maintain its superficial peace.

99
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
As my father grows increasingly frail,

100
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
and knowing my mediocre abilities,

101
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
and weak foundation,

102
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,560
if I were to inherit the throne one day,

103
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,560
either the King of Jingnan or Baili Yuan would surely rebel.

104
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,620
The people would inevitably suffer.

105
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,200
So my father ordered me to search for extraordinary talents across the land,

106
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
hoping to extend his life,

107
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,920
continue suppressing the King of Jingnan and Baili Yuan,

108
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,320
and eventually eliminate them,

109
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,490
to ensure peace throughout the realm.

110
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Later, a man in iron armor appeared.

111
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,600
He demonstrated some mystical magic in front of us

112
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,200
that was truly astonishing.

113
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,760
He claimed

114
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,200
that a mirage would appear in Dengzhou.

115
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,920
He said he could use this mirage

116
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,780
to help my father return to youth.

117
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,450
So my father secretly came to Dengzhou

118
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,380
and stayed at Wuji Temple.

119
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,280
Soon a mirage indeed appeared in Dengzhou.

120
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,680
My father successfully regained his youth

121
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,440
and transformed into a young man.

122
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,840
The emperor's soul has taken over my brother's body.

123
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,640
Then where has my brother's soul gone?

124
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,840
That I do not know.

125
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,920
Including who the Iron Man really is,

126
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,400
how such a massive city floats in the air,

127
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,960
how nearly 200 people suddenly disappeared,

128
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,490
then suddenly reappeared,

129
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,170
and why they all suffer from soul loss.

130
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,800
These are all mysteries to me as well.

131
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,800
You've just listed all the questions we wanted to ask.

132
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,920
You can't answer anything,

133
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
but you're champion at asking questions.

134
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,600
I got these files from you,

135
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,320
which proves you know much more.

136
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,640
Ever since the Iron Man appeared

137
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,520
claiming he could help my father regain his youth,

138
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,050
I became suspicious of him.

139
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,400
When the mirage appeared in Dengzhou,

140
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,200
I remembered what my mother once told me:

141
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,130
my father suffered a severe injury over 20 years ago.

142
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,240
His condition seemed hopeless,

143
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,760
then a mirage suddenly appeared at Gaomeng Lake,

144
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,920
and shortly after, he recovered miraculously.

145
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,560
Out of curiosity,

146
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,160
I began investigating the events at Gaomeng Lake from that time.

147
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
I discovered a mysterious organization

148
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,200
that was established after that mirage incident.

149
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,130
It was called the Zouwu Institute.

150
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
I suspect it was related to the mirage incident from that year.

151
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,080
But later, for unknown reasons, the Zouwu Institute was suddenly disbanded.

152
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,080
The investigation inevitably faced many obstacles.

153
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,920
Later, when a mirage appeared in Dengzhou,

154
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
my people finally found documents

155
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,080
about the Zouwu Institute in the palace's secret archives.

156
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,440
Only then did I learn

157
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,320
some secrets about the Gaomeng Lake mirage incident.

158
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Who was the head of the Zouwu Institute?

159
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,960
The Zouwu Institute reported directly to my father, the Emperor.

160
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,090
No one except him knew who the head was.

161
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,260
You've all seen those documents.

162
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,320
Besides their contents,

163
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
did you find anything else of value?

164
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,320
Since the Emperor has already regained his youth,

165
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,000
why are you all still staying in Dengzhou?

166
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,660
It's the Armored Man's order.

167
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,320
He said we must stay within 20 li of Dengzhou city

168
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,920
and can only leave after 60 days.

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,060
He helped my father regain his youth,

170
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,880
so my father naturally trusts him completely.

171
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,480
Is that all?

172
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,960
That's all I know.

173
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,720
If I knew more,

174
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,610
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

175
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,360
What's your plan now?

176
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,720
All these years,

177
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,840
I've helped my father deal with the Prince of Jingnan and Baili Yuan.

178
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,520
I've worked tirelessly.

179
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,920
Once the Prince of Jingnan died,

180
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,040
I became disposable too.

181
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,330
When birds are gone, bows are put away.

182
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,080
When rabbits are caught, hunting dogs are cooked.

183
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
All that talk about blood relations

184
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,960
was nothing but empty words.

185
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,440
Now...

186
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,760
Father's only concern is Baili Yuan.

187
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,600
So you're

188
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
planning to seek Baili Yuan's help?

189
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,580
How could he possibly help me?

190
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,400
I'd be lucky if he just gives me shelter.

191
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,330
What do you mean?

192
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,140
You're letting him go?

193
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,740
His hands are still stained with my father's blood.

194
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,920
That day I was only trying to save my father.

195
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
I never meant to take anyone's life.

196
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,140
Your father's death was an accident.

197
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,640
Like when you attempted to dig a tunnel to enter Shenjing.

198
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,200
I was worried you would ruin my father's rejuvenation plan,

199
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,800
so I sent people to watch you.

200
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,170
You got into a conflict.

201
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,480
But they didn't try to kill you,

202
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,080
and just retreated instead.

203
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,300
Because I didn't give the kill order.

204
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,360
And that time at Qingfeng Tower.

205
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,450
I could have killed you all,

206
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,120
but I didn't.

207
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,960
Let them go.

208
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,140
Many things I did were unintentional

209
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,000
or out of necessity.

210
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,680
What does that mean?

212
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,080
Can't kill them,

213
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
can't let them go.

214
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,120
Out of sight, out of mind.

215
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,400
My father must be sending people everywhere to look for me.

216
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,859
My staying here will only cause you trouble.

217
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,040
Please lend me some clothes

218
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,960
so I can travel in disguise.

219
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,160
I'm going to Chenzhou

220
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,329
to seek refuge with Baili Yuan.

221
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,890
I thought you were in your room.

222
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I'm used to living in the mountains.

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,730
I don't like being cooped up indoors all the time.

224
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,520
You're in much better spirits than I imagined.

225
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,060
What did you think I'd be like?

226
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,570
After all that trouble,

227
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,620
you ended up with nothing.

228
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,730
You must feel somewhat disappointed.

229
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,060
It wasn't all for nothing.

230
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,440
At least

231
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,240
we know the Emperor will stay in Dengzhou City for a full 60 days before leaving.

232
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,920
I was anxious before.

233
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,720
You're afraid that once the Emperor returns to the capital,

234
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,980
we'll lose our chance.

235
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,290
Yun Niang told me

236
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,410
you treated a wounded wolf.

237
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,460
Few people dare to get so close to wolves.

238
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,800
I was raised by wolves.

239
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,820
Before my father died,

240
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,880
he told me something.

241
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,250
One year when he was hunting in the mountains,

242
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,760
he found a young child in a wolf den.

243
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
About 2 years old,

244
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,000
filthy all over.

245
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,160
There was an old wooden basin in the den,

246
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,680
and there happened to be a river nearby.

247
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,000
So he deduced

248
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,760
that the child must have floated down the river

249
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
and been carried back by the wolves.

250
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,080
You and that wolf

251
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,680
lived and ate together.

252
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,920
But he felt this couldn't last forever,

253
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,400
so he decided to take me away.

254
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,880
Just then, the wolves returned.

255
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,140
But strangely enough,

256
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,220
they didn't attack my father.

257
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,420
They kept their distance from him

258
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,210
and allowed him to take me away.

259
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,480
So our family established a rule:

260
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,420
never hunt wolves.

261
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
Then Zeng Xin...

262
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,640
is he not really yours either?

263
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,680
But in my heart,

264
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,280
he is my real brother.

265
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,570
Does it hurt?

266
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,680
Okay, slowly.

267
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
Mugwort.

268
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,040
This Feng Buhai knows what he's doing.

269
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,500
He knew to use mugwort to stop your bleeding.

270
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,640
Then we don't need to change it.

271
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,570
What do you mean?

272
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,600
So his medicine is medicine.

273
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,080
But mine isn't?

274
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,810
My medicine is better than his.

275
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,200
Did you know Feng Buhai is skilled with a knife?

276
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,680
What's so strange about that?

277
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,880
Isn't it normal for military men to know how to use knives?

278
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,280
He even uses a gun during his night terrors.

279
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,920
But he's really good with a knife.

280
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,960
Much better than when he uses that staff.

281
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,600
He just applied some medicine on you.

282
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,130
Now you think he's perfect.

283
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,080
You're staying here for free

284
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,210
and never said anything nice about me.

285
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,840
Ouch! Don't move.

286
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,320
Lin Han?

287
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,840
Lin Han?

288
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,900
Where is he?

289
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,600
What's wrong?

290
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,640
Lin Han is nowhere to be found.

291
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,320
Wait a minute.

292
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,920
Cao Sheng,

293
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,640
judging by your expression,

294
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,570
what are you up to behind our backs?

295
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,360
Buhai.

296
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,700
Have another bowl.

297
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,780
No more for now.

298
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,320
Mom.

299
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,400
Just call me Guanying.

300
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm used to it.

301
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,440
Guanying.

302
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,300
Lin Han is gone.

303
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,320
Is Tongtong not in there either?

304
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,000
She just said she was going to buy something.

305
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,860
Looks like it's already started.

306
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,000
Lin Han said she would leave markers.

307
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
You can understand them.

308
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
What game is this?

309
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,960
Hide and seek?

310
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,480
I got it.

311
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,160
This way.

312
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,740
This short line clearly points this way.

313
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,760
Why?

314
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,760
This short line clearly points that way.

315
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,800
The markers have a code.

316
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,330
Two correct, one reversed.

317
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,560
Anyway,

318
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,760
let's retreat first.

319
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
I'll go back and treat their wounds.

320
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,080
Aren't you coming?

321
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,120
You all go back first.

322
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,520
I need to rest for a while.

323
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,600
I don't feel like moving right now.

324
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,400
Then I'll go ahead.

325
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
Be careful, you guys.

326
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,680
You stayed behind to talk to me about

327
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,880
the symbol on the Iron Man's arm, right?

328
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,160
It's similar to the symbols in my father's manuscript.

329
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,620
Let me show you something.

330
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,660
These were all drawn by Tongtong.

331
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,720
Tongtong,

332
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,760
come out for a moment.

333
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,200
Did she see my father's manuscript before?

334
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,760
Since you brought it back before.

335
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,720
Probably not.

336
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,240
She drew these before I brought back your manuscript.

337
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,920
Besides,

338
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,520
she clearly didn't want me to see

339
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,380
what she was drawing at that time.

340
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,200
That means

341
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,120
she might have known these symbols before.

342
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,620
I just remembered something.

343
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,640
I heard from Yunniang that

344
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,080
the Crown Prince brought people to the inn to rescue Zeng Xin.

345
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,200
They also took the files from my room.

346
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,480
Those files were kept together with my father's manuscripts.

347
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,440
But the Crown Prince didn't take my father's manuscripts.

348
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,040
At first, I thought they only wanted to retrieve the files

349
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,880
and didn't want the manuscripts.

350
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,360
But those manuscripts were originally in the cabinet.

351
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Why did they suddenly appear under the cushion?

352
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,620
So they're still here.

353
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,860
Even if they didn't want them,

354
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,800
or if they messed up the room looking for the files,

355
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,060
they wouldn't have put the manuscripts under the cushion.

356
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,040
There's only one possibility.

357
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,560
Someone had already placed the manuscripts

358
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,290
under the cushion before they came for the files.

359
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,760
Only the files were in the cabinet.

360
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,640
They found the files and took them directly.

361
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,200
Because that's what they came for,

362
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,600
so they never saw my father's manuscripts.

363
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,220
Who could have been the one

364
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,210
who put these manuscripts under the cushion?

365
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,970
Before they came to my room,

366
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,000
only one person had been in here.

367
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,040
Tongtong.

368
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,960
But in this situation...

369
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,220
It's not safe to leave her at home either.

370
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,360
Let me put these things away.

371
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,920
I need to talk to uncle about something.

372
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,320
Go wait in his room first.

373
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,280
Where did the people in the room go?

374
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,010
I just saw the master taking them to the backyard.

375
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,130
Tongtong, let's go.

376
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,760
She seemed very nervous at that time.

377
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,890
I thought you startled her by suddenly opening the door.

378
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,640
But thinking about it now...

379
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,260
Tongtong, come on.

380
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,520
Before that,

381
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
when Tongtong returned from shopping with Aunt Ji,

382
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,690
we were just organizing the manuscripts.

383
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,720
She must have seen the symbols on the manuscript,

384
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,920
that's why she looked through it again.

385
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,120
But for a child,

386
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,810
isn't her curiosity

387
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,600
a bit too persistent?

388
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,940
And she drew these symbols

389
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,920
before this incident happened.

390
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,680
Which means

391
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,280
she recognized these symbols long before.

392
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,570
Has she drawn these before?

393
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,280
I mean,

394
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,520
before she disappeared.

395
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,000
She's been acting strange since she returned after disappearing.

396
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,680
For example?

397
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,810
She used to be terrified of the sound of metal spatulas scraping iron pots.

398
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,000
I can't stand that sound!

399
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,400
But now she doesn't seem to react to it at all.

400
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,040
Grandma, let me help you.

401
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,850
I taught her kung fu.

402
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,360
And trained her regularly.

403
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,760
But now she's forgotten it all.

404
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,820
She can't even do the basics anymore.

405
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,560
I've heard about soul loss syndrome before.

406
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,120
However,

407
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,810
people just forget what happened before,

408
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,760
they still fear what they used to fear,

409
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,560
and skills they've learned aren't completely forgotten.

410
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,520
For example, if someone is afraid of snakes,

411
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,040
they'll still be afraid of snakes.

412
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,280
If someone knows how to swim,

413
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,800
they won't forget how to swim just because they have soul loss syndrome.

414
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,530
It's especially impossible to suddenly recognize these symbols.

415
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,200
Unless...

416
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,330
She's like Zeng Xin,

417
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,920
no longer herself.

418
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,360
Inside her body

419
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,840
is another soul.

420
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,290
Zeng Xin used to have martial arts skills.

421
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Now even I can easily subdue him.

422
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,720
Because the Emperor

423
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,880
doesn't know martial arts.

424
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,240
If the Emperor knew martial arts,

425
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,760
he wouldn't have been captured during his campaign.

426
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,420
They say he was captured by an ordinary soldier.

427
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,220
But how do we explain that ritual ceremony drawing?

428
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,920
So the emperor wanted to possess Zeng Xin's body,

429
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,360
his essence alone wouldn't be enough.

430
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,480
That's why he captured so many people,

431
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
and those people were like sacrifices,

432
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,640
having their essence consumed.

433
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,080
There's only one person sitting in the center of the drawing.

434
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,540
Based on our speculation,

435
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
only Zeng Xin had his soul replaced.

436
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,570
These are all just our guesses.

437
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,320
The true meaning of that drawing

438
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,780
might not be what we think.

439
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,930
Didn't you ask Tongtong

440
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,740
why she drew these things?

441
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,850
Before we're absolutely certain,

442
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,760
I don't want to tip them off.

443
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,560
You just don't want to face the fact that she's not Tongtong anymore.

444
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,200
My father,

445
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,600
Tongtong,

446
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,170
and the Iron Man all recognize these symbols.

447
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,960
Between them,

448
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,330
there must be some kind of connection.

449
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,440
Just now when the Iron Man swung at me,

450
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,640
he suddenly stopped.

451
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,840
It's very likely because I was protecting Tongtong.

452
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,560
The Iron Man was afraid of hurting her.

453
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,600
Tongtong was looking through these manuscripts earlier,

454
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
which shows she's very interested in them.

455
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,680
If you trust me,

456
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,020
I want to set a trap to test her.

457
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,680
When?

458
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,850
Not sure yet.

459
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,360
We'll wait for the right moment.

460
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,640
But if she takes the bait,

461
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,600
you'll know.

462
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,850
Even though I'm still injured,

463
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,840
if you need any help...

464
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
I need your help.

465
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,840
But you don't need to go into the mountains,

466
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,170
that's another matter.

467
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,540
After we leave,

468
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,880
I hope you'll keep an eye on Feng Buhai's daughter, Tongtong.

469
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,640
Tongtong.

470
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,240
Don't judge a book by its cover.

471
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,900
That's exactly what it means.

472
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,480
We'll leave the door unlocked.

473
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,080
Tongtong might enter my room

474
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,280
to take my father's manuscript.

475
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,640
Why is she here?

476
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,120
What is she waiting for?

477
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,780
Don't talk.

478
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,340
No matter what happens later,

479
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,720
don't make any sound.

480
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,440
With so many of us following her,

481
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,970
we could easily be spotted.

482
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,970
I'll follow her.

483
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,940
Look for the marks I leave.

484
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
You knew something was wrong with Tongtong all along.

485
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,100
Not that early,

486
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
and I wasn't sure.

487
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,400
Can someone tell me what's actually going on?

488
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,720
Let's talk while we walk.

489
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
So according to what you're saying,

490
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,490
Tongtong isn't really Tongtong anymore?

491
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,480
The soul that entered her body

492
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,810
must be extraordinary,

493
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,300
being able to understand those symbols.

494
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,760
And judging by her relationship with the armored figure,

495
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,090
it seems quite unusual.

496
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,199
So Tongtong's

497
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,929
soul-loss condition was fake.

498
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,820
What about the others?

499
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,659
All those missing people -

500
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,040
is their soul-loss condition fake too?

501
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Nearly two hundred people with their souls replaced.

502
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,760
Maybe Tongtong has the answers.

503
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,320
She took my father's manuscript

504
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
and exchanged it for several items with the armored person.

505
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,580
Let's see what she does with those items.

506
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,880
Young Master,

507
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,280
I've finally found you.

508
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,560
Advisor Geng,

509
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,690
how did you get here?

510
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,640
Young Master.

511
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,620
It's terrible!

512
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,400
More people have gone to the master's grave

513
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,640
to vandalize it.

514
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,060
Let's go check.

515
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,760
I'll go.

516
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
You all keep following the markers.

517
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,210
How can we understand without you?

518
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,420
You understand it now, right?

519
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,480
You

520
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,220
figured it out so quickly, young master.

521
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,660
Zeng Qian, you understand it too, right?

522
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,040
Corrupt official

523
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,640
gets what he deserves today.

524
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,520
You deserve to die!

525
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,560
All of you, stop!

526
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,240
Get away!

527
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,860
Stay away from him!

528
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,740
All of you, stay away from him!

529
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,400
Back off!

530
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,770
What did you say?

531
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,360
If you've got the guts, say it again.

532
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,200
Say it again!

533
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,480
Let's go.

534
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,480
Wait.

535
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,360
This wound doesn't look right.

536
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,200
You said before

537
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,660
that he died accidentally while saving you.

538
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,280
But judging from the wound,

539
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,540
it wasn't an accident.

540
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,060
It wasn't an accident.

541
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,570
I saw it with my own eyes.

542
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,730
Is what you saw necessarily the truth?

543
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,800
This wound isn't smooth.

544
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,240
The knife must have been

545
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,620
Then twisted toward the heart again.

546
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,840
It was clearly deliberate.

547
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,730
How could it be an accident?

548
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,320
This assassination technique disguised as an accident

549
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,600
is quite common in Qianji Guard and Imperial City Bureau.

550
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
That day I was only trying to save my father, the Emperor.

551
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
I never meant to take anyone's life.

552
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,740
Your father's death was an accident.

553
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,520
Those people were brought by the Crown Prince.

554
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,360
That means

555
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,180
the Crown Prince wanted to kill my father

556
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,440
and disguised it as an accident.

557
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,250
But why would the Crown Prince do this?

558
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,280
I even let him go.

559
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,980
How's it going?

560
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
Tongtong went into that abandoned house.

561
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
The person inside probably knows her.

562
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,560
There are four guards hidden in the courtyard.

563
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,040
They seem to have some fighting skills.

564
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,520
They drew their weapons at Tongtong but didn't attack.

565
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,200
So

566
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,000
Tongtong should be safe for now.

567
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,320
That carriage.

568
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
But I know the master has a carriage.

569
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,740
He drives it secretly,

570
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,120
keeps it with him at all times,

571
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,200
and never replaces it.

572
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,160
If you want to find more of his belongings,

573
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,640
there might be some in the carriage.

574
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,170
Where is that carriage now?

575
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
When the master decided to come to Dengzhou,

576
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,100
he entrusted the carriage to two of his confidants.

577
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,600
They will take the carriage to where it's supposed to go.

578
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,560
Lin Han told me

579
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,420
your father has a secret carriage

580
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,880
driven by his trusted man.

581
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,340
I wonder if this is the one.

582
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,560
If it is,

583
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,080
then the driver must be dead.

584
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,360
There's a pool of blood on the ground.

585
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,640
Now we need to find out who's inside

586
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,480
and

587
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,180
why Tongtong was able to find this place.

588
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,320
As the Crown Prince,

589
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,800
why would he kill a mere county magistrate?

590
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,640
And even disguise it as an accident.

591
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,740
There must be something hidden behind this.

592
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,130
Advisor.

593
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,400
Has my father done anything

594
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,570
unusual lately?

595
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,480
Unusual?

596
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,640
Well, that would be

597
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,700
he started taking his duties seriously.

598
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,960
At first, when citizens of Dengzhou went missing one after another,

599
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,290
the master was beside himself with worry.

600
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,120
After those people returned,

601
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,380
he didn't rest either.

602
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,520
He was still investigating a case about a missing family.

603
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,740
Missing persons case?

604
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,880
Recently

605
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,400
there's another case.

606
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,600
That family who performs opera by the river,

607
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,280
several family members,

608
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,120
suddenly disappeared without a trace.

609
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,280
It might be related to Wuji Temple.

610
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,050
Is it that opera performer?

611
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
You know about it?

612
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,880
Last time when my father and I were drinking,

613
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,810
he mentioned it.

614
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,320
He said that family has been missing and still hasn't returned.

615
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,440
And he suspects...

616
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,520
It's related to Wuji Temple.

617
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,720
No wonder the prefect sent a letter

618
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,980
advising master not to touch Wuji Temple

619
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,440
because the Emperor and his people are staying there.

620
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,570
The Crown Prince killed my father.

621
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,520
That actor's disappearance

622
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,920
must be connected to him.

623
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,640
But why would the Crown Prince target an actor?

624
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,160
Unless

625
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,170
he's not an ordinary actor.

626
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,600
Advisor.

627
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
What's this actor's name?

628
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,340
Where does he live?

629
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,700
I didn't expect you to arrive so quickly.

630
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,600
Good luck.

631
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,490
I happened to be nearby.

632
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,240
Cao Jiande's carriage has been in Dengzhou for days.

633
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,520
Who would have thought

634
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,200
that this ordinary carriage

635
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,600
would hide such secrets?

636
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,770
The Emperor is right here in Dengzhou.

637
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,560
You're Baili Yuan's right-hand man,

638
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,140
yet you dare come here?

639
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,240
If something goes wrong,

640
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,640
the balance between the Emperor and Baili Yuan

641
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,920
would be completely shattered.

642
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,520
We both came looking for this carriage

643
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,040
and met by chance.

644
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,760
The Emperor couldn't possibly detect my whereabouts.

645
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,960
Even if he did,

646
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,880
his presence in Dengzhou

647
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,040
actually makes it difficult for him to move against me.

648
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,560
Open confrontation

649
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,780
would look bad.

650
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,320
That room,

651
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,210
you went inside, right?

652
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
What did you find?

653
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,040
I haven't had a chance to look around properly

654
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,120
and you're already here.

655
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,120
I've already given you everything.

656
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,000
What I know

657
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,080
you already know too.

658
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,130
It's different.

659
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,170
You know him better.

660
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,480
When you go into that room again later,

661
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,280
you might make new discoveries.

662
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,160
I hope you'll cooperate with us.

663
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,960
Share any new findings

664
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,920
with us.

665
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,240
I said before,

666
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,160
we can make deals,

667
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,040
but there's no need to cooperate.

668
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,500
Isn't this exactly a deal?

669
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,560
You know,

670
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,420
I could easily prevent you from entering that room.

671
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,240
To make our partnership more pleasant,

672
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,340
I'll show my sincerity first.

673
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,400
This is what I got from inside.

674
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,640
It records the acceleration method.

675
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,600
I didn't expect Cao Jiande had already figured it out.

676
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,360
However,

677
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,130
I haven't found the most important thing yet.

678
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,280
For you,

679
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,240
the most important thing

680
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,480
must be the ore, right?

681
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,480
That's why

682
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,000
we need your help.

683
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,460
I've already shown my sincerity.

684
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,440
Now

685
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,880
it's time to see yours.

686
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,740
When you come out of there,

687
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,300
whether you find anything new or not,

688
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,560
come with us.

689
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
My 60-day limit hasn't expired yet.

690
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,040
I can't leave Dengzhou.

691
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,050
That's easy.

692
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,340
I have a little something here

693
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
that can solve this problem for you.

694
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,240
If you're willing,

695
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,260
you can come with me today.

696
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,700
More than that,

697
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,320
I have something else

698
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,400
you need more.

699
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,480
Just as I need the ore.

700
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,840
You don't have to come with me today,

701
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,680
but think it through carefully.

702
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,840
People can wait for time,

703
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,960
but time waits for no one.

704
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,780
You know how to contact me.

705
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,000
Report!

706
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,450
We're under attack!

707
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,130
I'm not very familiar with this place either.

708
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,340
How about this?

709
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,400
Let's split up

710
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,600
and ask around for the exact location of Guo Huai's house.

711
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,380
Lin Han.

712
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,240
I need to tell you something.

713
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,840
When you're asking for information,

714
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,080
try to be a bit more friendly.

715
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,320
Don't always keep such a stern face,

716
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,780
like you're made of stone.

717
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,680
Even if people know, they won't want to tell you.

718
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,410
Look at that.

719
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,620
That expression right there.

720
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,400
But come to think of it,

721
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,240
I've known you for so long

722
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,180
and I've never seen you smile.

723
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,800
Is there anything worth smiling about?

724
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,290
What's wrong with smiling?

725
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,650
Are you okay?

726
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:51,800
It's fine.

727
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,160
Sorry, young man.

728
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,860
What happened?

729
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,050
Nothing.

730
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,160
I found out.

731
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,380
It's in that small village across the river.

732
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,680
Who was that person just now?

733
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,280
You were talking to that person.

734
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,320
We all heard it.

735
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,560
He's Bai Liyuan's man.

736
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,360
What's this acceleration method he mentioned?

737
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,360
What about the ore

738
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,280
he was talking about?

739
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,940
You also mentioned a room.

740
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,360
But I looked inside,

741
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,600
all the rooms were empty.

742
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,000
There was nothing there.

743
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,180
Where is that room?

744
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,600
You recognize those symbols in my father's manuscript.

745
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,040
He must have mentioned this carriage.

746
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,840
That's how you found this place.

747
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,560
Isn't it?

748
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,440
Young Master.

749
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,170
It's Uncle Ming.

750
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,200
What happened?

751
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,040
The coachman who died

752
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,380
was our former house guard

753
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,900
who watched me grow up since I was little.

754
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,730
My condolences.

755
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,760
Yunniang,

756
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,020
remember to give Uncle Ming a proper burial.

757
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,000
You also heard what Tongtong and that person were saying.

758
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,440
This carriage seems to have hidden secrets.

759
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,040
But I just checked it

760
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,970
and didn't find anything unusual.

761
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,400
Since you won't tell us anything,

762
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,960
there's no need to keep this carriage.

763
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,120
We might as well burn it.

764
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,880
Stop!
