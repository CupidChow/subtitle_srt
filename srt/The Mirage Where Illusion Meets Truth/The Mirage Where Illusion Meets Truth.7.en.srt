1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,640
We've investigated the porters thoroughly.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,100
That day, besides Chen Qi,

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,160
there was also someone named Sun Yan.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
They were all drugged unconscious.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,840
The person who came in

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,440
must have been someone in disguise.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,560
What about the fire station?

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,020
Did you find anything out?

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,440
Boss, stop pacing around.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,200
What kind of people are they at that Taoist temple?

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,440
We helped put out their fire,

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,520
and not only did they not thank us,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,040
they interrogated us for hours.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,560
We're victims too!

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,080
Not only were several of our men knocked out,

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,480
we also lost a fire wagon.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,960
This matter

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
is suspicious.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,920
You suspect

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,240
Young Master Xie?

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,960
I've been wondering,

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,620
why would he invite us for drinks out of nowhere?

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
But, boss,

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,920
why didn't you tell the people at the temple about this?

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
Am I stupid?

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,640
Do you know who Xie Jingtang is?

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,170
Can we afford to offend him?

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,760
Assuming he's really involved in this,

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,930
if we don't tell,

30
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,960
the temple people won't know.

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,820
We won't offend

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,880
either side.

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,160
According to their statements.

34
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
Someone took advantage

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,080
while they were fighting the fire, knocked them out,

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,479
stole the fire cart,

37
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,000
changed into their uniforms,

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,560
and that's how they escaped.

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,440
But wasn't it said

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,039
that only one person got out?

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,880
Unless

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,420
there's something wrong with the fire cart.

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,360
Understood.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,320
Let's visit the fire equipment shop again.

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,180
One more thing.

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,330
The file you took last time was stolen by them.

47
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,120
No matter who they are,

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,180
we must get that file back.

49
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,720
Come in.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,840
So,

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,800
you had Xie Jingtang disguise you as a laborer

52
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,170
and entered the Taoist temple with me.

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,120
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,480
If I had told you earlier,

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,120
you would have to look after me

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
and that would distract you.

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,800
But you don't know martial arts.

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,880
It was very risky.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,660
I did consider sending Yunniang,

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,329
but sometimes martial arts skills alone aren't enough.

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Besides, with Yunniang's height,

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,329
she wouldn't pass as a laborer.

63
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,360
Her ability to mimic others' speech...

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm better at imitating.

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,840
At first, I disguised myself as Sun Yan, a foot masseur.

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,040
While waiting for you,

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,320
I found a chance to slip away.

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,160
Where's Sun?

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,920
He was just here.

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,240
I figured the Qianhuo Bureau people wouldn't easily enter the Taoist temple.

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,760
So,

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,400
Why haven't the Qianhuo people arrived yet?

73
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,480
They're already here.

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,400
Why haven't they gone in?

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,240
I still looked like the foot masseur,

76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,519
but I changed into the guards' clothes.

77
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,320
Open the door!

78
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
That's why they didn't recognize me.

79
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,600
When I saw Axin,

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I should have knocked him out first.

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,900
Luckily you showed up in time.

82
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,570
Otherwise, getting out

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,240
would have been much harder.

84
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
When you care too much, you panic.

85
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,320
I understand.

86
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Tell me.

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,000
Why

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
did you help me?

89
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,700
I promised you.

90
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,320
And I told you

91
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,050
I'm not a bad person.

92
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,880
You did say that before we entered the city.

93
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,640
But

94
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,100
if you're not a bad person,

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,860
why did you blow up the dam?

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm afraid you won't believe me if I tell you.

97
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
I didn't believe you before,

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,560
but now

99
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,720
I even believe in your strange illness.

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
You might as well tell me.

101
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,940
Six months ago,

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,140
I went to Shenzhou with my father.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,460
There's a river there called Baifang River.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,260
The imperial court built a new dam there.

105
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,480
When I went there for sightseeing,

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,960
I discovered that the dam was poorly constructed

107
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,180
with serious safety hazards.

108
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,330
I intended to inform my father about this matter,

109
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,370
but I couldn't find him.

110
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,600
Later I learned he was being hunted by the Imperial Guards

111
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
and had gone into hiding.

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
Considering the safety of the people,

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
I had no choice but to destroy the dam

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,240
to prevent greater disaster when the rainy season came.

115
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Although I tried my best to explain afterward,

116
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
the local officials,

117
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,380
in order to cover up the truth,

118
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,960
pushed all the blame onto me.

119
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Then I was wanted by the authorities

120
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,560
and then captured by you.

121
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,640
And then...

122
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,560
Wait.

123
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,320
You weren't actually captured by me.

124
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,250
You deliberately let me catch you.

125
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,480
Don't forget that.

126
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,840
Yes.

127
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,840
I used you.

128
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
So I felt guilty.

129
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,760
Helping you save Zeng Xin

130
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
was only natural.

131
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,080
If it was just because of guilt...

132
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,920
Then wasn't all your effort afterward a bit...

133
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,800
Too much?

134
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,810
Maybe because I felt even more guilty.

135
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,770
Do you remember that market at the foot of Jiuyuan Mountain?

136
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,000
I do.

137
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,690
I lived at Jiuyuan Mountain when I was little.

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,860
You've been there?

139
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm that little boy who played ring toss back then.

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,640
Here you go.

141
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,720
You can add a bamboo curtain on top to block the rain.

142
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,920
Leaving without saying goodbye back then

143
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,250
was truly unavoidable.

144
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
My father was an official in the Ministry of War,

145
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,970
responsible for mapping different regions.

146
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,159
Due to his special position,

147
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,360
he never stayed in one place for long.

148
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,800
That departure from Jiuyuan Mountain was particularly rushed.

149
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,620
I cried and argued with my father,

150
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,940
saying I wanted to say goodbye to you,

151
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,480
but he wouldn't allow it.

152
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,640
So I snuck out

153
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,080
to the spring near the mountain.

154
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,840
I actually saw you,

155
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,220
but before I could call out to you,

156
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,900
my father's attendants forcibly stopped me

157
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,010
and took me away.

158
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,340
Later, I traveled with my father to many places,

159
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,000
and more than ten years passed before I knew it.

160
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,860
But I never forgot the promise we made back then.

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,840
Later I returned to Jiuyuan Mountain,

162
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,370
only to find your family's cottage abandoned

163
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,320
and you were nowhere to be found.

164
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,809
But I never expected

165
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,320
that we would meet again like this in Dengzhou.

166
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,799
I think you've

167
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,380
mistaken me for someone else.

168
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,480
I did live in Jiuyuan Mountain when I was little,

169
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
and I often went to the market at the foot of the mountain.

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,260
But I don't remember any boy with ring toss games

171
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,000
or any childhood promises.

172
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,200
Throughout my childhood,

173
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
apart from Axin,

174
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,800
I had no other playmates.

175
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
How is that possible?

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,400
I recognize your dagger,

177
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,360
and your family were hunters too.

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Jiuyuan Mountain is huge,

179
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,020
there are many hunters there.

180
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,240
As for that dagger,

181
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,280
I found it in the mountains when I was 9.

182
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,650
Your story is quite beautiful.

183
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
And also,

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,920
you've been able to hold onto

185
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
a childhood promise,

186
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,730
persisting for so long.

187
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm truly touched.

188
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,520
But I'm really not the person you're looking for.

189
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,560
I hope

190
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,920
you find her soon.

191
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,800
I'll go upstairs to see if Axin is awake.

192
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,480
Young Master.

193
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,210
Don't speak.

194
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,940
Let me catch my breath.

195
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,160
What's wrong now?

196
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,930
The one-eyed beggar boy

197
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,200
is dead.

198
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,560
Blood flowing from all orifices.

199
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
The armored monster did it.

200
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,480
I was hoping he could prove my innocence,

201
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,680
that I didn't kill that carpenter.

202
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,600
But now there's no chance at all.

203
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,280
Bleeding from seven orifices.

204
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,680
Just like what was written in those case files.

205
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,800
Those people who died 20 years ago

206
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
were also killed by the Iron Armor Monster.

207
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,920
It has already begun in Dengzhou.

208
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,480
Should we warn Zeng Qian?

209
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,920
Why did the Iron Armor Man kill those people?

210
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,560
What are you talking about?

211
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
The Iron Armor Man killed the carpenter.

212
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,600
The little beggar saw it.

213
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,280
Now he's killed the little beggar

214
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,960
to frame me for it.

215
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,160
Forget it.

216
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,090
I won't talk about this matter now.

217
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,880
Cao Sheng.

218
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,760
Help me with another matter.

219
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,690
That Gu Tingmei I mentioned before

220
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,400
stole my family heirloom.

221
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,440
Can you help me get it back?

222
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,800
What family heirloom?

223
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,600
What is it?

224
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
You, Young Master Xie, in Dengzhou

225
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,400
if not a local tyrant,

226
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,930
at least a small-time boss.

227
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,040
You already know who stole it.

228
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,600
Why not just take your men and demand it back?

229
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,040
My father only has connections with the prefect.

230
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,880
The Gu family

231
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,320
has connections in the capital.

232
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,200
We can't afford to offend them.

233
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,260
If you can't afford to offend them, we certainly can't.

234
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,120
Cao Sheng,

235
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,800
you promised me.

236
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,460
How about I come up with a plan for you?

237
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,480
Aren't you skilled at disguise?

238
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,280
Just disguise yourself as his father

239
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,800
and make him give it to you.

240
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,840
I practice disguise techniques,

242
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,160
not transformation magic.

243
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,640
People who know him would still recognize me.

244
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,280
I understand. This is simple.

245
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,680
I'll make preparations.

246
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,720
What preparations?

247
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,320
Dr. Xie,

248
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,380
please help me.

249
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,840
Stop fooling around.

250
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,970
I still need help with my own problems.

251
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,120
What did you

252
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,560
just call me?

253
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,400
Dr. Xie.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,760
What help do you need?

255
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,320
Please tell me.

256
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,360
Treat someone's injury.

257
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,960
Where?

258
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,490
Let's go.

259
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,340
Aren't you coming?

260
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Aren't you taking your medical kit?

261
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
Please wait a moment, sir.

262
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,400
I'll go get my medical kit.

263
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,560
Young master.

264
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,610
Although this acupuncture

265
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,880
will keep you from falling asleep.

266
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,220
But this is not a long-term solution.

267
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,720
Each time you use the needle, it becomes more painful than before.

268
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,800
And the next time you have an attack,

269
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,540
you'll sleep longer than the previous time.

270
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I remember you used to sleep for less than half an hour.

271
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,840
But since the last time,

272
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,300
when you used the needle to save your master,

273
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,680
you slept for an hour.

274
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,880
And then it became two hours.

275
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,840
If this continues,

276
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,680
the next time you have an attack,

277
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,360
if you fall asleep,

278
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,960
who knows how long it will be before you wake up.

279
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,000
Yunniang.

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,880
You know that the longer this needle stays in my body,

281
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,840
the worse my condition will become.

282
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,360
If you don't remove it,

283
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,090
by the time of my next attack...

284
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,920
I don't even know if there will be a next time.

285
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,080
I'm sorry, young master.

286
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,940
I'll pull it out for you right now.

287
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,800
There's something else.

288
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,760
Do you think

289
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,080
Zeng Qian might be lying to you?

290
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,080
Actually...

291
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,440
What are you doing, Yunniang?

292
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
I thought it would be like pulling a tooth when we were kids.

293
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,440
Taking you by surprise

294
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,520
so it wouldn't hurt as much.

295
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,240
If you had let me prepare myself,

296
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,640
it wouldn't have hurt so much.

297
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,280
I won't do it like this next time.

299
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,960
What did you just say about Zeng Qian deceiving me?

301
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,000
What I meant was

302
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,200
she's actually that little girl from years ago

303
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,000
who deliberately pretended not to recognize you.

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Yunniang.

305
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,730
How did you know?

306
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Were you eavesdropping on us again?

307
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,480
I was waiting for you there.

308
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,080
I overheard it by accident.

309
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Young Master.

310
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,040
So is she really that little girl from back then?

311
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,440
If she's not,

312
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,960
you've already helped her rescue her brother,

313
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,090
so you don't owe her anything anymore.

314
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,920
Can we leave Dengzhou now?

315
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,600
Let's wait a bit longer.

316
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,880
Dengzhou is now a place of trouble.

317
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,820
I feel like something big is about to happen.

318
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,800
If we don't leave now,

319
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,530
I'm afraid it might be too late.

320
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,120
Let me think about it.

321
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,120
All right.

322
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,220
I'll go prepare something for you to eat.

323
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,840
Chong'er.

324
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,400
What are you thinking about?

325
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,560
Father.

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,120
Is that city you told me about real?

327
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,930
Can it really fly in the sky?

328
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,680
Of course it's real.

329
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,960
Where is it?

330
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,760
Why do we need to go there?

331
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,370
When we reach that city,

332
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,280
we can cure your illness.

333
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,340
That's wonderful!

334
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,800
I won't suddenly fall asleep anymore.

335
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,160
Father.

336
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,720
Let's go there now.

337
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,560
Father.

338
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,760
Is that city difficult to find?

339
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,280
We will find it.

340
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm saying there are so many doctors in the city,

341
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,440
why come to me specifically?

342
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
I mainly trust your medical skills.

343
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,840
Besides,

344
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,920
this matter needs to be kept confidential.

345
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,800
I believe you

346
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,600
mainly trust my medical skills.

347
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,440
This way.

348
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,040
Why is it her?

349
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,040
Axin.

350
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,000
Where am I?

351
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Who are you?

352
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,840
Don't be afraid.

353
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
Your name is Zeng Xin.

354
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm your sister, Zeng Qian.

355
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,690
Take it easy.

356
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,640
Xin.

357
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,400
Do you also have

358
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,520
a bone whistle like this?

359
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,200
How is it?

360
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,400
Who did this?

361
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,050
They were so brutal.

362
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,090
She's suffering from internal injuries.

363
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,960
She won't die for now.

364
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,480
I've given her acupuncture treatment.

365
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
She should wake up in a few hours.

366
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,880
But to completely heal her internal injuries,

367
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,820
I need to consult my medical books

368
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,610
and find another solution.

369
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,680
Here.

370
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,760
Be careful, it's hot.

371
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Axin.

372
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,320
Tell me,

373
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,680
do you remember

374
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,300
how you ended up at the Taoist temple?

375
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,600
I woke up there.

376
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,730
I couldn't remember anything.

377
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,800
I didn't know who I was

378
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
or where that place was.

379
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,320
I was so scared.

380
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,200
I wanted to escape,

381
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,380
but there were fierce men guarding the door.

382
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,760
They had knives

383
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,290
and they beat me.

384
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
So I didn't dare to run away anymore.

385
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,440
I just stayed there,

386
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,500
sleeping when I was tired.

387
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,880
They gave me good food.

388
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,600
But whenever I asked them anything,

389
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,080
they wouldn't tell me.

390
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,560
I don't know how long it was

391
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,400
before you came.

392
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,520
Don't worry.

393
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,520
From now on, I'll be here for you.

394
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,720
No one will ever bully you again.

395
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,000
Boss.

396
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,800
You were looking for me?

397
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,920
Go to Renxin Clinic

398
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,200
and borrow a set of Acupuncture Classic for me.

399
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,640
Okay.

400
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,840
Wait.

401
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,760
Get the ten-volume edition,

402
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,560
not the twelve-volume one.

403
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,240
Remember that.

404
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,600
Ten volumes of the Acupuncture Classic.

405
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,360
Got it.

406
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,400
Judging by your look,

407
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,860
you've prepared what I asked for.

408
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Zeng Xin is awake.

409
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
How is Zeng Xin doing?

410
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,480
He's alright.

411
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,540
Zeng Qian is talking to him right now.

412
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,440
What about my situation?

413
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,520
It's okay.

414
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,840
What do you mean by 'okay'?

415
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,480
You need to disguise yourself as Gu Tingmei's father.

416
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
Didn't I say it wouldn't work?

417
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,120
Their father-son relationship is so close.

418
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,840
If I get even a little bit close,

419
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,040
he'll see through me.

420
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,250
What if he can't see you?

421
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,250
Let's go home, Ting'er.

422
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,090
What are you doing with that thing?

423
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,930
Just in case.

424
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,090
That's a bit extreme, isn't it?

425
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,080
If you stab someone with this, they'll die.

426
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,330
Who said I was going to stab anyone?

427
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,040
Sir, your

428
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,720
carriage broke down.

429
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,380
I came back to rest for a while.

430
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,440
Sir.

431
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,600
Ting'er.

432
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,820
Go put these things in the room first.

433
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,000
Yes.

434
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,850
Why did you come back suddenly?

435
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,420
Stop being so clumsy. What's wrong with you?

436
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,680
What is that thing?

437
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,480
I'll wash this for you. Let's go.

438
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,920
Number Three.

439
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,120
Stop.

440
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,560
I forgot my jar of wine.

441
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,180
I think I left it at the gatehouse.

442
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,680
Look at my memory.

443
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,840
Let's go back and get it.

444
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,680
Yes, sir.

445
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,540
Let's hurry back then.

446
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,880
You've shown up with bad intentions.

447
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,010
Who's the visitor here?

448
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,600
Last time you came to my house for vegetable buns,

449
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
you learned quite a bit, didn't you?

450
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
We didn't take anything from your house.

451
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,780
You went to my place

452
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,440
and left me with nothing but an empty box.

453
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,320
Tell me,

454
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,960
where did these things come from?

455
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,400
Also,

456
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,130
the secrets inside,

457
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,840
how much do you actually know?

458
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,800
Your questions are quite surprising.

459
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,720
These are questions I was going to ask you.

460
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,000
If you hadn't come to find me,

461
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,280
I would have come looking for you.

462
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,010
Then let's find a place to talk.

463
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Can you wait a bit?

464
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,200
I'm a little busy right now.

465
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm afraid not.

466
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,200
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

467
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,360
Come here.

468
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,120
What is this stuff?

469
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,840
Soapberry powder.

470
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,300
You'll be fine in a moment.

471
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,050
What are you doing with that stuff?

472
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,080
How does it feel?

473
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,880
Any better?

474
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,440
Oh no!

475
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,800
I can't see anything!

476
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,520
No, no.

477
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,360
Don't panic.

478
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,600
Let me rub it for you.

479
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,120
Ouch!

480
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,980
A little pain means it's working.

481
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,240
By the way,

482
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,200
Xie Jingtang's family heirloom?

483
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,040
I have it here.

484
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
The middleman said for some reason,

485
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,920
the buyer couldn't be reached.

486
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,320
But they made contact today.

487
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,850
The deal is this afternoon.

488
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,240
I found another buyer.

489
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,770
They're offering a higher price than before.

490
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,600
How much?

491
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,530
Twice as much as before.

492
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,540
But they want to inspect the goods first.

493
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,920
Yes.

494
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,120
How is it?

495
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,880
That's right.

496
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,560
Your beard.

497
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,690
What about my beard?

498
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,000
Nothing.

499
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,000
Xie Jingtang,

500
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
get out of the way.

501
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
Let go of me.

502
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,680
Move aside.

503
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,880
Ouch.

504
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,120
Good son,

505
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,280
I'm leaving.

506
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
Xie Jingtang.

507
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,810
Didn't the master just return?

508
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,240
How did the carriage break down?

509
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,960
Didn't we just talk about this?

510
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,440
My wine should still be here, right?

511
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,850
Open the door for me.

512
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
Stop him!

513
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,180
Where is the young master?

514
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,000
Didn't he say we would meet here?

515
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,850
Has he already gone back to the inn?

516
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,040
He's never done this before.

517
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,440
He can take care of himself.

518
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,080
Let's go.

519
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,360
Finally got it back.

520
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,140
It's just a large chess piece.

521
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,560
How did it become your family heirloom?

522
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,130
I don't know either.

523
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,840
Anyway, it's been passed down through generations.

524
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,900
For over 100 years.

525
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,360
It's glowing.

526
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,280
Yes.

527
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,680
Why is there a small light spot?

528
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,520
Now you know why it's our family heirloom.

529
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,360
Why did it stop moving?

530
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,520
Look, it's moving again.

531
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,180
Seems like we need to shake it.

532
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,860
Did I shake it too hard?

533
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
This thing...

534
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,840
Does it have some secret mechanism?

535
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,440
That's why it's called a treasure.

536
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,400
Someone's dead!

537
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,000
There's been a death!

538
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,120
What happened?

539
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,680
What's wrong with you?

540
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,080
My boss was fine just now,

541
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,600
then suddenly dropped dead.

542
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,280
Blood coming from all orifices.

543
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
I'm scared to death!

544
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,560
Someone's dead!

545
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,800
Useless when it matters,

546
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,340
yet excellent at making trouble.

547
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,080
I was blinded at the time.

548
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,280
I truly couldn't tell which of you was real.

549
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,000
Enough.

550
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,840
Stop talking.

551
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,040
Let's figure out what to do now.

552
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,100
Xie Jingtang has already taken the item.

553
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,300
If the buyer doesn't see the item,

554
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,760
we can only watch as the money

555
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,760
slips through our fingers.

556
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,520
That heirloom doesn't look special at all.

557
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,720
Why don't we find a similar stone,

558
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,160
polish it a bit,

559
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,680
and maybe we can get away with it.

560
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,960
Yunniang.

561
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,760
This is the second time.

562
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,360
The second time I've seen someone die this way.

563
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,170
I need to tell the young master.

564
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,360
Boss.

565
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,080
It really is you.

566
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,600
Who else would it be?

567
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,400
Here's the book you wanted.

568
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,480
Good. Got it.

569
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,040
Even I can't recognize myself anymore.

570
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,040
Those things you mentioned.

571
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,300
I really don't remember anything at all.

572
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,960
That bad man in black clothes killed my father.

573
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,240
Then he's our enemy.

574
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,760
Have you found him?

575
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,760
I want to kill him.

576
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,160
My whistle.

577
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,920
It was really similar to yours.

578
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,600
They locked me in a room.

579
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,120
I blew it.

580
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,600
They took the whistle away.

581
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,800
And threw it outside.

582
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,530
They wouldn't let me pick it up.

583
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,440
Here.

584
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,520
This is yours from now on.

585
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,010
If anything happens, just blow it.

586
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,440
And I'll come right away.

587
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,160
I'll tell you later where this bone whistle came from.

588
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,960
Okay.

589
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,530
Is Axin feeling better?

590
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,600
Much better.

591
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,260
Have you seen my young master?

592
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,530
Isn't he in his room?

593
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,200
No, he's not.

594
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,170
Mother-in-law,

595
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,360
where is the place we buy vegetables?

596
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,600
It's that market in the west of the city.

597
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,920
I find your memory is getting worse than mine lately.

598
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,040
That's because you have such a good memory.

599
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,760
Liu Guanying.

600
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,960
Liu Guanying.

601
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,199
You're awake.

602
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,320
Don't move.

603
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,130
It hurts.

604
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,760
It hurts.

605
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,820
What are you doing?

606
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm treating your wounds.

607
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,120
You still have needles in your body.

608
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,179
Don't move around.

609
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,360
This can't be pulled out.

610
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,920
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

611
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,080
You have needles in your head.

612
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,540
Please don't move around.

613
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,720
How can you still be so strong when you're injured?

614
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,560
Tell me.

615
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,420
Where did these things come from?

616
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,200
Wuji Temple.

617
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,720
You're not telling the truth, are you?

618
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,840
Some of these manuscripts were given to you by Qianji Guards.

619
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
You are...

620
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,900
That Qianji Guard.

621
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,260
I remember you.

622
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,660
I'm looking for Cao Sheng.

623
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,570
Since you know everything,

624
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,490
I won't hide anything anymore.

625
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,000
I hope you won't hold anything back either.

626
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,120
However,

627
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,140
shouldn't we find a more suitable place to talk?

628
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,460
This place is quite suitable.

629
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,360
That Qianji Guard who gave you the item

630
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,880
is the deputy commander of the Han Division.

631
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,010
His name is Shen Hui.

632
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,120
He's someone who takes orders from Lin Han.

633
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,400
This thing might have come from Lin Han herself.

634
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,840
Since neither of us knows the truth about this,

635
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,640
perhaps Lin Han will have answers.

636
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,770
We can ask her later.

637
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,380
Lin Han is here?

638
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,660
Your item was given by Lin Han.

639
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,120
What's your relationship with Lin Han?

640
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,000
You must have already gone through these manuscripts and files.

641
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,800
If what's written there is true,

642
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,080
then everyone who returned after disappearing

643
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,840
will die.

644
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,560
Even if they leave Dengzhou,

645
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,820
going as far away as possible won't help.

646
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,040
According to the records in the files,

647
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,720
everyone who returned after disappearing from Gaomeng Lake died within a year

648
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,160
in different places.

649
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,770
The furthest one

650
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,400
even reached the Kingdom of Gaoyue, 3,000 miles away from Gaomeng Lake.

651
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,360
This proves that the situation then was the same as Dengzhou now.

652
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,020
First, people started dying.

653
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,640
People realized the danger

654
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,700
and fled in droves.

655
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,570
But in terms of results,

656
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,100
doing so was meaningless.

657
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Now we're facing the lives of nearly 200 people,

658
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,650
including Tongtong

659
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,880
and Zeng Xin.

660
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,160
There might be some misunderstandings between us,

661
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,020
but given the current situation,

662
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,320
we should put aside our differences and work together

663
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,810
to prevent this disaster from happening.

664
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,760
What's your relationship with Zeng Qian?

665
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,600
Is she worth all this effort from you?

666
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,440
Or rather,

667
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,200
do you have other motives?

668
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,280
Why are you asking me this?

669
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
You suspect me

670
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,480
because I'm not curious about the mirage at all.

671
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,440
And I suspect you

672
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,970
because you're too curious about the mirage.

673
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,800
Have you seen it before?

674
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,400
I truly hadn't seen any mirage before coming to Dengzhou.

675
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,200
But my father died unnaturally,

676
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,360
and the truth behind it is shrouded in mystery.

677
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,240
Everything I'm doing now

678
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,970
is to unravel these mysteries.

679
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,380
But whatever the case,

680
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,160
our goals are aligned.

681
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,120
Being friends is better than being enemies, right?

682
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,050
We should share what clues we know.

683
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,440
Four years ago, there was a mirage on the Hu River.

684
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,200
You saw it.

685
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,640
Why didn't you tell us?

686
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,960
I'm not certain that the mirage from four years ago

687
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,320
has any definite connection with what's happening in Dengzhou now.

688
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,450
That painting was drawn by my comrade.

689
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,610
And he died unnaturally because of it.

690
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,880
I still haven't figured out what happened.

691
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,320
I can't explain it to you.

692
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,000
If I can't explain it,

693
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,060
why should I talk about it?

694
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,000
Can you describe the circumstances of his death?

695
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,130
I've already answered your question.

696
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,420
Now it's my turn to ask.

697
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,040
The same question as before.

698
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,100
What exactly is your relationship with Lin Han?

699
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,660
She was my father's subordinate.

700
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,720
I know there's someone behind you.

701
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,850
You were put up to this by someone else.

702
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,840
I want the truth.

703
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,500
Now it's my turn to ask you.

704
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,400
No need.
