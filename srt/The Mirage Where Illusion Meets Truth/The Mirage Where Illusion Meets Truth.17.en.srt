1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,080
Your current bargaining chip

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,280
with just He Xiguang is far from enough.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,840
Unless you add another person:

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,800
Baili Yuan.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,360
You simply want to go to Shenjing for treatment.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,400
I'm the only one who can save you.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,840
That's Baili Yuan we're talking about.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,320
You overestimate me.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,520
I can't kill him.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,640
That's why you need opportunities.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,560
The first opportunity

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,760
is with He Xiguang.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,340
I'll arrange people to put on a show with you.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,760
Make him trust you.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,360
But you must keep it secret from Zeng Qian and the others.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,080
Because the second opportunity

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,160
is with Zeng Qian.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,120
She

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,160
is Baili Yuan's daughter.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,160
Otherwise, why would Baili Yuan order

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,360
to save a child rescued from a wolf den?

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,240
Their relationship isn't hard to figure out.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,640
Don't tell me you haven't thought about it.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
I have,

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,520
but I wasn't certain.

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,920
He Xiguang is an outsider.

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,880
Don't you want to know why

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,760
Baili Yuan keeps him close?

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,420
This has nothing to do with me.

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
I just want to ease

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,240
the guilt you'll feel when dealing with him.

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I don't recall agreeing to help you.

33
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,360
Baili Yuan is a descendant of the royal family of Dian Kingdom

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
who normally would never have been trusted with power.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,800
But in recent years, Great Yin has faced numerous rebellions

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,640
with conflicts breaking out everywhere.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,280
The Emperor fears my military achievements are too great,

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,960
that I might become too powerful to control.

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,440
But with no other capable people in court,

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,060
he had no choice but to promote Baili Yuan

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,320
and let him achieve military success.

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,200
As a result,

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,860
while it counterbalances me,

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,820
Baili Yuan has also become too powerful to control.

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,440
Baili Yuan has always harbored ambitions to restore Dian Kingdom,

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,500
but never had the right opportunity.

47
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,520
Until He Xiguang appeared with his Jiya beast.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,480
You keep saying

49
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,759
it was He Xiguang's Jiya that killed my father.

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,890
But all your Jiya beasts look the same.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,320
Is it possible

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,360
that you're the thief crying 'stop thief'?

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Are they the same?

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,290
No, they're not.

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,400
He Xiguang's Jiya has a collar around its neck,

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,530
while mine doesn't.

57
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
Both of you have Jiya.

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,040
Aren't you afraid I'll go to Baili Yuan

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,320
and work with him instead?

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,360
That won't happen.

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,620
The two Jiyas have different abilities.

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
What my Jiya can do,

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
his Jiya may not be able to do.

64
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
At the very least,

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,960
his Jiya

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,170
can't help you find the Mirage,

67
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,480
can't remove that protective barrier,

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,490
and can't make people exchange souls.

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,880
Your Jiya knows where the Mirage is?

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Not only that,

71
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,680
I can make my Jiya

72
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
control the Mirage to go anywhere.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,920
Then dealing with the Outsiders must be extremely simple for you.

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,180
You just need your Jiya

75
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,040
to move the Mirage to the sea

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,100
or some desolate place like a desert.

77
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,640
Without physical bodies, the Outsiders' souls in the Mirage

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,040
would naturally perish.

79
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,640
My Jiya can control the Mirage,

80
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,770
but there's one exception.

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,600
That is

82
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,930
when the Outsiders want to use the Mirage to exchange souls.

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
At that time,

84
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,040
my Jiya loses control over it.

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,079
The ones who truly control it

86
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,610
are the distant Outsiders.

87
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,560
We've witnessed the Mirage's protection.

88
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,000
You just said your Jiya can break through the Mirage's protection.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
Then why not destroy the Mirage directly?

90
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,040
I wish I could.

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,770
Unfortunately,

92
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,300
it's not that easy.

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,200
Even if I agree,

94
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,320
I'd have to deceive Zeng Qian

95
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,400
and take her to kill her own father.

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,480
Even if the Mirage could cure my illness,

97
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,810
Zeng Qian would kill me.

98
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,880
It would all be for nothing.

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,940
What's in it for me?

100
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,240
I never said you should kill Baili Yuan.

101
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,480
That poison you tried to make me drink last time,

102
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,740
do you still have some?

103
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,570
You have the antidote for that poison.

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,360
It only kills someone

105
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,490
after twelve hours.

106
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,690
Baili Yuan has something you want.

107
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,240
He Xiguang got a map from your father.

108
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Let me show you something I got from it.

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,730
This records an acceleration method.

110
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,200
That map is extremely important to me.

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
When you go to the Baili residence,

112
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,720
Baili Yuan will surely recognize Zeng Qian as his daughter,

113
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,680
and since you're close to Zeng Qian,

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
Baili Yuan will lower his guard around you.

115
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,760
So

116
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,970
you'll have a chance to poison him.

117
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
Just force him to hand over the map,

118
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,200
then give him the antidote,

119
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,060
and there won't be much harm done.

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,080
After all,

121
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
from this trip,

122
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,480
what you'll gain is that

123
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,600
Baili Yuan can reunite with his daughter Zeng Qian,

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,840
I'll give up this body,

125
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,170
and Zeng Xin can return.

126
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,730
Feng Buhai can also find his daughter.

127
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,540
And you can cure your illness.

128
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,370
When you think about it,

129
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I really think it's worth it for you.

130
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,700
I appreciate your concern for me.

131
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,680
But on that map,

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,880
is it really some kind of acceleration method?

133
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,409
You don't need to know that.

134
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,000
You only need to know

135
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
that I am your only hope.

136
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,900
I live in the west wing.

137
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,380
You all can come rest there for a while later.

138
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,200
Relax a bit.

139
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,040
Don't look so on edge.

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,860
No need for plants,

141
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,760
there are already plenty of soldiers here.

142
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,220
It's a general's mansion.

143
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
You'll get used to it.

144
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,320
This is my residence.

145
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,720
Feel free to look around.

146
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,810
Your courtyard is quite peaceful.

147
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,040
My place

148
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,170
is relatively safe.

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,360
You even keep a dog here.

150
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,159
I didn't know you had this hobby.

151
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,560
So that's what you meant by safe.

152
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,040
He Xiguang's dog Jiya has a collar around its neck.

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,490
Why do I feel like this place is actually the most dangerous?

154
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,170
You're still laughing.

155
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,400
Why is this armored man locked in a cage?

156
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,120
He's not locked up.

157
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,159
The door is open.

158
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,760
His hobby is really strange.

159
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,039
The one who broke into the prison

160
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,240
was this Ji Ya, right?

161
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,130
It doesn't matter anymore.

162
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,040
Please wait here for a moment.

163
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
I'll go inform Master Baili.

164
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
The backyard has a nice view.

165
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,960
Feel free to look around.

166
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
I must say, Cao Sheng,

167
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,160
you really know how to hold back.

168
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,600
What do you mean?

169
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
He's the one who killed your father!

170
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,440
Are you mocking my young master?

171
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,360
No,

172
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,080
I can truly empathize.

173
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,920
If the Prince of Jingnan stood before me,

174
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,640
I couldn't be as composed as you.

175
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,320
You're doing this for the greater good.

176
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,180
In this regard,

177
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,880
you're far better than I am.

178
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,210
I don't mean anything else by saying this.

179
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,880
I mean, please wait a moment.

180
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,080
They've kept us waiting for four hours.

181
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
What does this mean?

182
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,920
Cao Sheng.

183
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
On my way here,

184
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,440
my left eyelid kept twitching.

185
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,680
It's still twitching.

186
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
Do you think they're

187
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,680
detaining us in disguise?

188
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,240
There's no one here

189
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,160
except for us.

190
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,880
Isn't there still a man in armor over there?

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,960
Are we trapped here?

192
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
If they wanted to make a move,

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,520
they wouldn't have waited until now.

194
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,720
No, that's not right.

195
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,440
Left eye twitching means fortune coming.

196
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,500
Right eye twitching means disaster.

197
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,010
Left eye for fortune, right...

198
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,840
Do you realize what situation we're in?

199
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,800
Could you please be serious?

200
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
This is no time for jokes.

201
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,520
Everyone,

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,880
it's the rule of this mansion.

203
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Visitors must surrender their weapons and be searched before seeing Master Baili.

204
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,240
Please cooperate with us.

205
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,520
Place your weapons here.

206
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,740
Do I need to leave this too?

207
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,640
Where did you get this knife?

208
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,640
How dare you speak like that?

209
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,930
Is this how we treat guests in Baili Manor?

210
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

211
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,040
You must be hungry.

212
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,600
Here.

213
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Have something to eat first.

214
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,840
We've been waiting for so long.

215
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,120
I'm absolutely starving.

216
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,760
Finally, there's food.

217
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,640
But this little bit of food you're offering us

218
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,040
is really not much at all.

219
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,200
At least we treated you to grilled fish.

220
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,000
And this is all you're giving us?

221
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,560
Is this some kind of test?

222
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,440
What is this bitter stuff?

223
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,730
Listen, Feng Buhai.

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,260
How can you stomach something so bitter?

225
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,200
Because on the battlefield,

226
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,330
he's eaten things far worse than this.

227
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,100
I pay my respects, Lord Baili.

228
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Please, everyone, no formalities.

229
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,120
Buhai,

230
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,200
this isn't a military camp.

231
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,880
You've been out of uniform for years now.

232
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,640
Please rise.

233
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,960
You knew who he was.

234
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,440
Why didn't you tell me?

235
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,360
Master Baili's way of treating guests

236
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,880
is truly perplexing.

237
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,600
These bitter cakes were just made.

238
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,200
Everyone in my household knows my intentions.

239
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,320
I wouldn't get honest opinions from them.

240
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,280
Therefore,

241
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,880
I had to resort to this method.

242
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,040
Fine delicacies

243
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,300
are rare in this world.

244
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,440
It's the first time I've seen someone

245
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,500
deliberately making food taste bad.

246
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,840
No matter how unpalatable,

247
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,920
it's still food.

248
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
You've all come from afar.

249
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
Serving only bitter cakes

250
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,810
is rather discourteous to you all.

251
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,480
I've ordered a proper dinner to be prepared.

252
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,120
Shortly,

253
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,040
you may enjoy it at ease.

254
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,840
Master Baili should understand

255
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
the purpose of our visit.

256
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,100
We didn't come here to eat.

257
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,040
Xiguang has told me about your situation.

258
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,600
But my abilities are limited,

259
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,640
I'm afraid I cannot help.

260
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,780
The King of Jingnan has a Jiya,

261
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,160
and so do you.

262
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,000
I believe the King of Jingnan told you many things about me.

263
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,400
Most of it is mere speculation.

264
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,560
However,

265
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,290
there is one thing that's true.

266
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,080
His Jiya

267
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,400
can control mirages

268
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,320
and exchange people's souls.

269
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,720
But my Jiya

270
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,480
cannot do that.

271
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,800
Thank you all for your trust,

272
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,080
but I

273
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,720
truly am unable to help despite my willingness.

274
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,840
If you don't mind,

275
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,560
please stay at my residence for a few more days

276
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,880
before making further plans.

277
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,680
I

278
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,940
must take my leave now.

279
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,640
Forgive my boldness,

280
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,160
Lord Baili Yuan,

281
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,080
is it because you fear the King of Southern Jing

282
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,410
that you cannot help us?

283
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,640
Those I fear

284
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,280
have never been them.

285
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
There's one more thing I wish to ask.

286
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,210
In the 34th year of Jingyun,

287
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,240
did you order

288
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,960
someone to rescue my family at Jiuyuan Mountain?

289
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,820
I have never met you before, miss.

290
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,600
I don't remember doing this.

291
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
I'm also quite unfamiliar

292
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,040
with this place called Jiuyuan Mountain.

293
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,920
When I was working at the Zouwu Agency,

294
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,880
I did receive secret orders

295
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,210
to rescue their family.

296
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,450
Were you ever the head of the Zouwu Agency?

297
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,520
In the 34th year of Jingyun,

298
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,800
the head of the Zouwu Agency

299
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,920
was indeed me.

300
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,720
But I never issued such an order.

301
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,320
Unless...

302
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,000
Buhai,

303
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,280
the order you received

304
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,960
was given by someone impersonating me.

305
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,800
I'm very sorry

306
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,340
that you came with such high hopes

307
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,200
only to leave disappointed.

308
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,520
I rode two days at full gallop

309
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,280
only to be fed with these bitter pills

310
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,640
and a big bowl of rejection.

311
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,520
You've already met Master Baili,

312
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,450
so you weren't actually rejected.

313
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,900
Is there a difference?

314
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,760
You need to give us an explanation.

315
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,440
I'm only responsible for introductions,

316
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,170
not for guaranteeing results.

317
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Everyone,

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
see you at dinner.

319
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,800
Feng Buhai

320
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,040
It seems Baili Yuan doesn't respect you either.

321
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,900
I never said I had much influence.

322
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,080
You still haven't told me.

323
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
You recognized him.

324
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,340
Why didn't you tell us?

325
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,040
Lord Baili must have his reasons for appearing like this.

326
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,700
I couldn't expose him rashly.

327
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,780
What about you?

328
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,599
Why didn't you speak up for us just now?

329
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,960
Baili Yuan was right.

330
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,119
His Ji Ya

331
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,119
truly doesn't have the ability to control mirages.

332
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,119
You could have told us from the beginning.

333
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,880
If I had told you earlier,

334
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,420
would you still have brought me here?

335
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,880
So your initial reluctance

336
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,960
was just playing hard to get.

337
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,960
You're allowed to use me,

338
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,480
but I'm not allowed

339
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,000
to use you?

340
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,640
If we use Baili Yuan's Ji Ya

341
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
against the King of Jingnan's Ji Ya

342
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,010
to force the King to submit,

343
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,240
would this method work?

344
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,610
Unless absolutely necessary,

345
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,040
both sides

346
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
won't let their Ji Ya fight each other.

347
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,140
Is it because they're evenly matched

348
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,360
and confrontation would only harm both?

349
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,720
Mutual destruction is inevitable,

350
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
but not because they're evenly matched.

351
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,720
That's strange.

352
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,480
Why is that?

353
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
You don't need to know these things.

354
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,420
It seems the only way to get Baili Yuan's help

355
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,240
is through the ore.

356
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,880
Perhaps.

357
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,840
But what is this ore,

358
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,780
what is it used for?

359
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,080
You have no idea.

360
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,440
If you tell us, then we'll know.

361
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
Even if you knew but couldn't find it,

362
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,240
you still wouldn't need to know.

363
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,900
Feng Buhai.

364
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,340
Turn your face away

365
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
so I can slap her.

366
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,640
The more I look at her, the more I can't stand her.

367
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,440
You're valuable to both He Xiguang and Baili Yuan.

368
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,920
What exactly can you offer them?

369
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,520
Your position among those outsiders

370
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
is no less important than my father's

371
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,770
or He Xiguang's.

372
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,160
Well,

373
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,020
it's that silence is golden moment again, isn't it?

374
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,020
So your purpose in coming here with us

375
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,840
was just to ensure you could stay.

376
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,240
If I don't want to leave,

377
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
there's nothing you can do about it.

378
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,050
This is the Baili residence after all.

379
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,440
Zeng Qian.

380
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,250
These two look like they can really fight.

381
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
But in terms of numbers,

382
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,560
our chances of winning are

383
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,020
practically zero.

384
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Everyone, please don't be so tense.

385
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,480
We don't want to start a fight.

386
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
We just want to say

387
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,400
the food is ready,

388
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,000
and hope you won't leave in such a hurry.

389
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,280
Also,

390
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,840
this time,

391
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,000
we won't be having bitter cakes.

392
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,240
You promised me

393
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,490
that when we arrived at Baili Manor

394
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,020
you would no longer restrict my freedom.

395
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,980
In the current situation.

396
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,000
It's safer to let her go

397
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,800
than to hold onto her.

398
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,420
I want to see Master Baili.

399
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,640
Sure.

400
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,570
Let's eat first.

401
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,720
This courtyard was specially prepared for you.

402
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,280
You've all had a tiring journey.

403
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,800
Thank you for your hard work.

404
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Today you can enjoy a good meal

405
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
and get some rest.

406
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
What good meal?

407
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,260
I'm full of anger instead.

408
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,680
Aren't you afraid that if you follow us like this

409
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,520
we might put a knife to your throat

410
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,120
and force you to hand over Tongtong?

411
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,480
We're all smart people here.

412
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,810
Why would anyone do something so foolish?

413
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
I really want to know

414
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,840
what our current situation is.

415
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,040
Are we being detained

416
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,200
or under house arrest?

417
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,280
I think it's neither.

418
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,840
There are no guards in this residence.

419
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,970
It's very peaceful.

420
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,480
You're free to come and go as you please.

421
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,120
If you don't mind,

422
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,560
you can stay at the Baili residence for a few more days

423
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,690
before planning your return journey.

424
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,060
Where is Tongtong now?

425
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
She's at my place.

426
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,640
Don't worry.

427
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,880
She has the same freedom

428
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,960
as you do.

429
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
However,

430
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,880
if you want to visit her,

431
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,080
please let me know in advance.

432
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,320
Don't forget,

433
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,160
I have dogs in my courtyard.

434
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,480
Is this your idea or Master Baili's?

435
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,700
This is your daughter's wish.

436
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,480
She's not your daughter.

437
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,320
You know that.

438
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,440
When will you arrange for me to see Master Baili?

439
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,200
I'll go inform him right now.

440
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,920
What's in your bundle?

441
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,200
My eating utensils.

442
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,730
I have to carry them with me.

443
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,000
How did you know Zeng Qian is Baili Yuan's daughter?

444
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,240
I am the emperor now.

445
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,970
It's normal for me to know such things.

446
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,400
Even if this is true,

447
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,640
Baili Yuan can still deny it.

448
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,960
If he wanted to acknowledge her,

449
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,620
he would have done so long ago.

450
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,100
So you need to be prepared.

451
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,040
Even if Baili Yuan meets Zeng Qian,

452
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,770
he will pretend not to know her.

453
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,920
When that happens,

454
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,580
you'll need to give him a push.

455
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,840
Today, Baili Yuan's guard

456
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
when he was collecting our weapons,

457
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,160
he saw my sword

458
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,840
and his reaction was quite intriguing.

459
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,840
He was about to say something at that moment,

460
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,080
but Baili Yuan

461
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,920
and He Xiguang interrupted him just in time.

462
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,240
The guard's reaction

463
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
suggests that

464
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,000
he has very likely seen my sword before.

465
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,280
I don't believe what Baili Yuan said this afternoon.

466
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,880
The secret orders from Zouwu Institute aren't so easily forged.

467
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,640
If he really is the person who saved you back then,

468
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,000
why would he lie to you?

469
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,860
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

470
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,480
The problem is,

471
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
if he denies it, there's nothing we can do.

472
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,280
We're being too passive now.

473
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,880
We need to be more proactive.

474
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,840
Feng Buhai is about to meet with Baili Yuan.

475
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,640
We should take this opportunity

476
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,210
to investigate some matters thoroughly.

477
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,320
Just a moment.

478
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,660
Please come in, honorable guest.

479
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,970
Greetings, sir.

480
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,160
No need for formalities.

481
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,120
Please sit.

482
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,380
Feixing, Qianyun,

483
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
you may leave now.

484
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,720
Buhai,

485
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,120
it's been many years.

486
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,400
I saw your weapons at Xiguang's place this afternoon.

487
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,160
The former top swordsman of Shenji Battalion,

488
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,800
why are you using a staff now?

489
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,200
It suits me better now.

490
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,880
Many people after retiring from military service

491
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,280
often recall scenes from the battlefield.

492
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,130
I suppose you do too.

493
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,760
Sometimes

494
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,040
I get scared.

495
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,800
Perhaps

496
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
you just miss it.

497
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,060
Do you know what mistake you made?

498
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,680
I'm too stupid to understand.

499
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,140
Please enlighten me, sir.

500
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,600
This afternoon when you were confiscating their weapons,

501
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,720
you saw that sword.

502
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,770
Why did you say such things?

503
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,820
Because you have the same dagger.

504
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,160
I thought

505
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,280
she stole it.

506
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,640
Haven't you considered

507
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,840
that I might have given her that dagger?

508
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,800
I truly didn't think of that.

509
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,520
I've followed you for many years.

510
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,840
You've always treasured that dagger.

511
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,880
That young lady seems unfamiliar.

512
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,440
She has no relation to you.

513
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,120
I thought,

514
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,920
why would you give your precious dagger to her?

515
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,010
Your thinking is thorough.

516
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,000
But your actions were reckless.

517
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,920
If her dagger is a replica,

518
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,960
by saying this,

519
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,400
she would know

520
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
the authentic one is in my Baili residence.

521
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,650
I acknowledge my fault.

522
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,280
Enough.

523
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,720
Learn from this.

524
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,320
Be more careful with your words and actions in the future.

525
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,480
You may leave.

526
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,820
From what we've heard, Zeng Qian,

527
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,540
this Baili Yuan has a dagger almost identical to yours.

528
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
This knife seems quite special.

529
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,850
It's the person who's special.

530
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,880
Zeng Qian.

531
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,800
Weren't you abandoned?

532
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,400
Is this knife your keepsake?

533
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,560
If that's the case, it's very possible.

534
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,840
I found this knife.

535
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,040
That's quite a coincidence.

536
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,640
If this knife belongs to you,

537
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,900
he could very well be your father.

538
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,840
That outfit looks great on you.

539
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,880
Yes,

540
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,490
where did you get it?

541
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,730
I stole it from their laundry room.

542
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,640
Oh no!

543
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,170
I need to return it quickly.

544
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,800
You've come to see me,

545
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,880
presumably for your daughter.

546
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,440
You're perceptive, sir.

547
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,480
Before you came,

548
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,800
did you consider she might choose to stay here?

549
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,800
I did,

550
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,920
but I believe I can take her back with me.

551
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
That would have been possible,

552
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
but only if

553
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,760
she were truly your daughter.

554
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,720
Years ago, you executed Prince Yu's entire family,

555
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
acting first and reporting later.

556
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,890
Your memorial was powerfully worded,

557
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
claiming everything was done to maintain regional peace

558
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,920
and bring justice to the people.

559
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,280
Back then, you feared no authority

560
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,600
and had keen judgment.

561
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,720
Now these outsiders come from foreign lands

562
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,660
yet freely occupy the bodies of our Great Yin citizens.

563
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,840
Sir, do you think

564
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,320
this is just?

565
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,520
After the Battle of Wusuling,

566
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,640
you requested a transfer from the Divine Mechanism Camp.

567
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,160
When I asked why,

568
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,400
you said you didn't want to see any more deaths.

569
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,400
Have you ever considered

570
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
why there were so many deaths?

571
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,620
Because of war.

572
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,000
Why was there war?

573
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,220
In the 16th year of Jingyun reign,

574
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,650
a locust plague hit Changzhou,

575
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,760
60,000 starving people,

576
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,560
incited by a postal official, stormed the government office,

577
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,520
causing a riot.

578
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,860
In the 21st year of Jingyun reign,

579
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,850
the southwest suffered flooding,

580
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,640
hundreds of miles were submerged,

581
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,840
the waters didn't recede for two years,

582
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,560
people became homeless,

583
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,920
and gathered in Yongzhou to rebel.

584
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,120
In the 27th year of Jingyun reign,

585
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,960
blizzards ravaged the northern frontier,

586
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,880
tens of thousands of herdsmen lost all their livestock to the cold,

587
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,140
and couldn't survive.

588
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,640
They

589
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,640
joined the Mangbei cavalry to invade our territory.

590
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,420
In the 35th year of Jingyun reign,

591
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,370
severe drought hit the northwest,

592
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,560
crops failed for three consecutive years,

593
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,640
over 200,000 victims

594
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,800
rebelled while fleeing south for food.

595
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,440
These

596
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,240
were just the major conflicts

597
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,970
that I personally took part in.

598
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,680
The smaller ones

599
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,600
that I wasn't involved in

600
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,760
throughout the hundred years of Da Yin dynasty

601
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,960
are countless.

602
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
Actually, we both know

603
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,040
common people are easily satisfied.

604
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,960
As the saying goes,

605
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,160
'Three acres of land, one ox,

606
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,520
a wife, children, and a warm bed.'

607
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,240
As long as they have food and clothing,

608
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,280
people won't rebel.

609
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
But whenever disaster strikes,

610
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,040
crops fail,

611
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,530
and relief grain from the court isn't enough.

612
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,200
Then people

613
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,840
are forced to eat tree bark,

614
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,200
edible clay,

615
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,240
dead bodies,

616
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,720
and eventually, the living.

617
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,640
They have only one thought:

618
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,280
to survive.

619
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,160
So they must steal,

620
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,200
stealing leads to killing,

621
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,520
killing becomes rebellion,

622
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,080
rebellion might get them killed.

623
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,850
But without rebelling,

624
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,760
they'll certainly starve to death.

625
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,840
All these years,

626
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,240
all the disasters,

627
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,640
all the conflicts,

628
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,840
stem from two words:

629
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,640
food supply.

630
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,520
Do you know why I developed the bitter cake?

631
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,320
Whenever disaster strikes,

632
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,520
the court's relief grain isn't enough,

633
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,040
it's further reduced by corrupt officials,

634
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,160
and some people falsely claim or take extra portions.

635
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,560
Under these circumstances,

636
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,120
some officials resort to extreme measures,

637
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,400
like mixing sand into porridge.

638
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,600
This ensures

639
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,040
only genuine victims come for food.

640
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,120
But sand in porridge

641
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,660
is extremely harmful.

642
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,220
While the bitter cake is unpleasant,

643
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,240
it causes no physical harm.

644
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,600
So this afternoon,

645
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,400
when you had us eat the bitter cake,

646
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,440
it was to verify

647
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,500
if it was truly difficult to swallow.

648
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,040
So in future relief efforts,

649
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,000
people won't falsely claim extra portions.

650
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,360
But this method

651
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,340
only treats the symptoms, not the cause.

652
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,920
The reason I'm cooperating with He Xiguang and these outsiders

653
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,480
They want to solve the food problem at its root.

654
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,370
They came from a distant world beyond the sky.

655
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,460
They possess extraordinary skills.

656
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,600
It's no exaggeration to say they can command the wind and rain.

657
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,680
In their land,

658
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,140
famine has long been eliminated.

659
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,000
Because they can predict weather patterns

660
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,740
and control rain and wind.

661
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,080
The food they produce in one year

662
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,610
is enough to feed everyone for several years.

663
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,680
If they apply their techniques here,

664
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,040
then our land

665
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,980
would become incredibly prosperous and peaceful.

666
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,080
By then,

667
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,610
there would be no more droughts or floods,

668
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,520
no crop failures,

669
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,520
no one would go hungry,

670
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,480
and naturally, no one would rebel.

671
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,240
We would have no need for war.

672
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,400
Then

673
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,080
we wouldn't see so many deaths.

674
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Isn't that right?

675
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,960
Did the King of Jingnan tell you?

676
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,120
Everything I've done

677
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,280
was to restore Dian Kingdom.

678
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,880
He did it for the world.

679
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
You also did it for the world.

680
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,400
Your purpose was not originally different from his.

681
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,600
The world he speaks of

682
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,560
is not the world of all people.

683
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
It's just the world of his Li family.

684
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,560
Whether this world is good or bad doesn't matter to him.

685
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,960
What matters is

686
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,320
that the emperor always bears the surname Li.

687
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,160
Because he fears change

688
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,520
and fears the arrival of outsiders.

689
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Aren't you afraid, sir?

690
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,280
They're just using our bodies

691
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,680
to live in this world, that's all.

692
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,360
If you describe their world as so wonderful,

693
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,360
why would they come here?

694
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,840
I only said they have no famine there.

695
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,040
I never said their place was that great.

696
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,240
Now they're just occupying our bodies,

697
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
but what if

698
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,080
they want more in the future?

699
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,880
I certainly have my methods.

700
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,800
Then your cooperation with He Xiguang

701
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,199
isn't sincere either.

702
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,040
Even sincerity has its boundaries.

703
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,000
You already have He Xiguang, sir.

704
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,920
Tongtong is more important.

705
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,080
You just said, sir,

706
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,520
that common people only want a small farm and an ox,

707
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,440
a family and a warm bed.

708
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,600
But now,

709
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,130
they can't even keep their children safe.

710
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,040
So,

711
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,690
what about this world you speak of?

712
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,659
It's not a world without harm.

713
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
But the problem is,

714
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,920
she's no longer your child.

715
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,280
The King of Jingnan didn't know her importance before,

716
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,600
which is why he let you leave Dengzhou

717
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,680
and safely arrive here.

718
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,040
If you take her away,

719
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,280
you'll only put her in danger.

720
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,080
You need her

721
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,320
because she can help you

722
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,780
bring more people from beyond to this place.

723
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,440
The King of Jingnan needs her

724
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,320
to do the opposite.

725
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,640
Since she's so important,

726
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,970
and both you and the King need her so badly,

727
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,720
how can there be any danger?

728
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,520
I needed Cao Jiande too.

729
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,700
But what happened?

730
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,520
She's important to us.

731
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,120
But it's also important

732
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,000
that we don't have her.

733
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,880
It's important that we don't have her.

734
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,640
What does that mean?

735
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,680
Between Baili Yuan and the Prince of Jingnan,

736
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,080
we must choose one.

737
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,400
This way, at least one side will be our friend.

738
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,800
But if we choose neither,

739
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,980
then both become our enemies.

740
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,760
If we can't use her for ourselves,

741
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,840
then we can't let others use her either.

742
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,370
So it's about destroying what you can't have.

743
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,760
That statement

744
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,890
is clearly a threat.

745
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,060
It's also reality.

746
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,800
If we can't take Tongtong with us,

747
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,360
does that mean we've lost everything?

748
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,920
According to Baili Yuan,

749
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,720
He Xiguang's Jiya killed my father.

750
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
He knew about it,

751
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,960
or even ordered it.

752
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,040
On one side is the man who killed your father,

753
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,170
on the other is the man who killed mine.

754
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,920
Our current situation

755
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,570
is truly difficult.

756
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,400
But whether it's Baili Yuan or the King of Jingnan,

757
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,460
they have no reason to help us.

758
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,760
Unless we can give them what they want.

759
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,400
The ore.

760
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,980
But we know nothing about the ore.

761
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,640
Let's look on the bright side.

762
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,600
We've already left Dengzhou,

763
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,400
and

764
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,040
Tongtong is no longer threatened by that monster.

765
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,210
Only temporarily, I'm afraid.

766
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,120
Based on what happened at Gaomeng Lake,

767
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,650
running to the ends of the earth won't help us.

768
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,920
That monster is strange too.

769
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,940
Why does it only kill people from beyond?

770
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,260
Let's solve the problems we can solve right now.

771
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,220
I just want to know if Baili Yuan was lying or not.

772
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,840
The person who gave the secret order to save Zeng Qian back then,

773
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,920
was it really him?

774
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,970
Haven't you seen enough of this kind of thing?

775
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,120
I thought

776
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,060
when he came to this world,

777
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,920
things could be different.

778
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,580
Why would it be any different?

779
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,850
Those armored men serving the emperor

780
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,040
aren't any different.

781
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,400
It's just the difference between having a leash and not having one.

782
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,120
The lowborn

783
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
are treated as lowborn everywhere.

784
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,560
The halberd that killed Cao Jiande

785
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,320
was it yours

786
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,200
or the King of Jingnan's?

787
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
What do you think?

788
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,480
They both had motives,

789
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,840
but yours and Baili Yuan's were stronger.

790
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,260
Though the King of Jingnan had disagreements with Cao Jiande,

791
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,600
it wasn't enough to kill him.

792
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
At Huhe River,

793
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,090
Cao Jiande killed all those thousands of rebels.

794
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,020
Causing the souls in the mirage to have no physical bodies.

795
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,000
If he hadn't died,

796
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,600
such things would happen again.

797
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,760
Although his methods were extreme,

798
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,120
his reasoning

799
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,800
wasn't without merit.

800
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,560
You agreed with him,

801
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,640
yet you still sided with us in the end.

802
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,250
Is it because of hatred?

803
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,680
Do you think

804
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,850
Baili Yuan is trustworthy?

805
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,600
At least he's our best option right now.

806
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,440
He can accept us.

807
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,920
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

808
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,920
Do you think he can truly accept us?

809
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,520
When our people arrive in large numbers,

810
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,780
what can he do about it?

811
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,840
Hasn't he thought of this?

812
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,360
Don't I know he's thought of this?

813
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,960
So,

814
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,320
you still gave him that map.

815
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
By all rights,

816
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,480
you should have destroyed it.

817
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,160
Without the ore,

818
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,240
the map is meaningless to him anyway.

819
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,140
Speaking of which,

820
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,600
you should give me what I want now.

821
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,640
No pain, no gain.

822
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,810
Although you agreed to cooperate with us,

823
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,570
I haven't seen your contribution yet.

824
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,360
As people here often say,

825
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,760
you can't catch a wolf without risking the bait.

826
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,360
I prefer another saying from here.

827
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,240
Don't release the hawk until you see the rabbit.

828
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,760
Do you know

829
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,420
what I like most about you?

830
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,460
Your personality.

831
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,400
Do you know

832
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
what I hate most about you?

833
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,000
Also your personality.

834
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,890
Feeding fish early in the morning,

835
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,440
you really have time for such refined pleasures.

836
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,120
Even though I'm living under someone else's roof,

837
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,520
I can't just keep feeling sorry for myself.

838
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,660
You're quite well-informed though.

839
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,040
We just arrived yesterday,

840
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,370
and today you're already meeting with me.

841
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,240
I left Dengzhou City in a hurry last time,

842
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,100
I didn't get a chance to thank you.

843
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,370
You didn't expect we would meet here, did you?

844
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,460
It's a bit surprising,

845
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,330
but thinking about it, it was inevitable.

846
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,440
The King of Jingnan wouldn't give up his physical body so easily,

847
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,120
Baili Yuan is your only option, isn't he?

848
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,640
You even know about this.

849
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,690
Baili Yuan told you, didn't he?

850
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,940
Before at Wuji Temple,

851
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,040
I called out to Father Emperor for so many days,

852
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,570
never expected it was the Thirteenth Prince.

853
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,280
It's quite ridiculous when you think about it.

854
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,840
What's your plan now?

855
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,380
I've never been someone who craves power since childhood.

856
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,400
Being the Crown Prince for so many years,

857
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,730
I've always felt like walking on thin ice.

858
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,770
On one hand, I had to be a good son in front of my father.

859
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,680
On the other hand, I had to turn a blind eye

860
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,540
to the King of Jingnan's actions.

861
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,800
Because once we openly confronted each other,

862
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,410
there would certainly be no good outcome.

863
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,720
So all these years I've been enduring,

864
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,460
suffering in silence.

865
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,040
Now I actually feel liberated,

866
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,200
with an indescribable sense of relief.

867
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,640
Are you truly free?

868
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,240
You're now the prime suspect in the King of Jingnan's murder.

869
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,370
Have you considered

870
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,760
why Baili Yuan would take on such a hot potato like you?

871
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,360
What if someday

872
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,160
he hands you over?

873
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,880
He won't.

874
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,760
Although the King of Jingnan stole the throne through deception,

875
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,220
compared to his so-called magical rejuvenation techniques,

876
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,300
my identity as Crown Prince is more legitimate.

877
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,080
If the King of Jingnan really pushes things too far,

878
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,480
then Baili Yuan could simply refuse to recognize him as Emperor.

879
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,240
If he puts me forward at that time,

880
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,640
whether the King of Jingnan can keep his throne

881
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
is questionable.

882
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,280
So holding onto this hot potato that I am

883
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,080
might not be such a bad thing.

884
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,880
When cold, it warms your hands.

885
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,880
When hungry, it fills your stomach.

886
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,410
I didn't expect you to be so clever.

887
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,780
If you became Emperor,

888
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,120
that would be quite good too.

889
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,170
You're quite clever yourself.

890
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,080
Yes,

891
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,200
but unfortunately that's not my fate.

892
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,460
It's not unfortunate.

893
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,160
It's actually quite fortunate.

894
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,260
My father must be sending people everywhere to look for me now.

895
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,170
Please lend me some clothes

896
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,000
so I can disguise myself.

897
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,480
Go to Chenzhou

898
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,490
to seek refuge with Baili Yuan.

899
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,560
Thirteen.

900
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,240
You've gone to great lengths to get where you are today.

901
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,890
What about Father Emperor's remains?

902
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,920
Did you really bring them back to the capital

903
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,180
or leave them exposed in the wilderness?

904
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,880
Although he often restrained me,

905
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,000
I never hated him.

906
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,900
Until you sit in his position,

907
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,000
you'll never know how difficult it was for him.

908
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,960
The one who died in that tent was

909
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,920
just an actor.

910
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,040
He took his own life then.

911
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,040
He had no choice.

912
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,280
All my planning

913
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,860
was never meant to target you.

914
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,410
Even though we fight as family,

915
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,930
blood is still thicker than water.

916
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,080
We have a common enemy.

917
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,160
So,

918
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,080
your real target is

919
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,560
Baili Yuan.

920
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,320
There are some things

921
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,320
I cannot do.

922
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,080
But you can.

923
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,240
If you seek Baili Yuan's protection as a criminal,

924
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,420
he will certainly take you in.

925
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,320
Do I have a choice?

926
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,560
It's me who has no choice.

927
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,770
You want me to be your secret agent.

928
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,930
Aren't you afraid I'll join forces with him against you?

929
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,540
That's why I need to tell you something else.

930
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,720
Do you know where he came from?

931
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,960
Cao Sheng and his people have arrived at Baili Manor.

932
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,600
I heard they didn't even stop to eat on the way.

933
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,920
They must be really anxious.

934
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,000
It seems the Eighth Prince has already made contact with them.

935
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,800
Chi Mo has already positioned his men near Baili Manor.

936
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,560
As soon as the Crown Prince makes his move,

937
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,090
they'll be ready to assist.

938
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,400
However,

939
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,080
I'm concerned that

940
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,410
Cao Sheng and his people might see through the Crown Prince.

941
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,520
Don't worry.

942
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,520
They won't be focusing on the Eighth Prince.

943
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,680
To get them all gathered at Baili Manor,

944
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,120
I've gone to considerable trouble.

945
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,960
I hope that useless Eighth Prince

946
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,740
can actually be of some use this time.

947
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,370
What are you eating?

948
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,400
Noodles.

949
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,680
You're clearly eating pan-fried dumplings.

950
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,210
Why ask if you already know?

951
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,160
What are you doing?

952
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,290
The porridge is hot.

953
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,610
This bowl is cooler.

954
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,040
I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful.

955
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,570
I just don't like porridge.

956
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,480
Great.

957
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,240
Porridge first thing in the morning.

958
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,000
Thanks.

959
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,690
Why is this porridge so hot?

960
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,040
You two knew about this, didn't you?

961
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,000
So mean.

962
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,800
You're just eating too quickly.

963
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,440
Morning.

964
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,100
Why aren't you eating your porridge?

965
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,690
It's hot.

966
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,330
How do you know it's hot?

967
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,220
Your lips are already burned.

968
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,120
How did Cao Sheng's condition become contagious?

969
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,720
Zeng Qian.

970
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,840
Zeng Qian.

971
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,730
What's going on?

972
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,760
The buns are poisoned.
