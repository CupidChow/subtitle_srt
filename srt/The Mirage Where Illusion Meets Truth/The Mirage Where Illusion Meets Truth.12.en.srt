1
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,040
Chong'er.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,040
Which of these groups are your men?

3
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,140
This group is the Iron Pagoda from Dian Kingdom.

4
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,280
This group is our Great Yin's Hengchong Regiment.

5
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
The Iron Pagoda has 6,000 men.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,080
The Hengchong Regiment has only 500.

7
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,360
Do you know what?

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,000
But people often say there's only the Hengchong Regiment in this world,

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,600
and no more Iron Pagoda.

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,160
It means the Hengchong Regiment won in the end.

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,240
500 against 6,000.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,160
How did they win?

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,680
Why don't we simulate it?

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,760
The terrain is too complex.

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,680
You'll definitely get lost if you're in there.

16
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,160
No matter how complex something is,

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,759
in your eyes it's just a map.

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,320
When you look at it once,

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,080
that map is already in your mind.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,080
What you need to do is

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,880
figure out how to retrieve this map from your mind.

22
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,970
Focus your will undivided,

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,880
concentrate your spirit,

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,360
and it will naturally appear.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,979
But there are so many enemies over there,

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
and I have too few people.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
When two forces are evenly matched,

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,960
it comes down to bravery.

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,840
But to win with fewer numbers,

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,920
bravery alone isn't enough.

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
You also need strategy.

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,360
Only then is victory truly remarkable.

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,490
Using troops is like using people.

34
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,090
Your numbers may be few,

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,160
but each person has their own strengths.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,760
Some excel at attacking,

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,160
some at close combat,

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,760
some have immense strength,

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,920
some are agile and nimble.

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,320
Working together creates extraordinary results.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Look at these mountains and rivers,

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,560
forests and lowlands.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
If you use them well,

44
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,240
they can all be your allies.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,180
Those who understand warfare

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,760
act without confusion,

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,680
and their resources are inexhaustible.

48
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,080
Yangjialing is divided into northern and southern peaks.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,160
According to Bao,

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,320
the Crown Prince and his party are still at the northern peak of Yangjialing

51
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
and haven't returned yet.

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,440
This means they didn't find anything yesterday.

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,840
They might move to the southern peak today.

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,560
When did you prepare this?

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,240
Bao made this too.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,280
It's bare with no trees.

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880
You've gotten close to him quite quickly.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,960
Bao was being a bit lazy here.

59
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,800
The south mountain of Yangjia Ridge has steep cliffs on three sides

60
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,960
that are impossible to climb.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,560
Only one side is accessible.

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,360
This means

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
even if we successfully kidnap the Crown Prince,

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,440
our retreat routes will be very limited.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,579
We need a meticulous plan.

66
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
We'll hide the horses

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
and continue on foot.

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,080
Everyone split up and proceed separately.

69
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,340
Be extremely careful.

70
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,440
Kidnapping the Crown Prince

71
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,800
during his hunting trip would be nearly impossible.

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,960
The best opportunity

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,890
would be at night

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,200
when they're camping and resting.

75
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,800
What if they catch the celestial horse

76
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
and return today?

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,360
That's why we can't let them catch anything.

78
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,040
Their hunting skills are amateur,

79
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,570
but we have professionals.

80
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
This is the place.

81
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,370
What's that strange smell?

82
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,120
Is it urine?

83
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,400
Do these celestial horses mark their territory with urine like dogs?

84
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,260
It's not urine.

85
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,000
Celestial horses have a small opening below their eyes.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,920
It secretes a scented fluid.

87
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,740
They use it to mark areas near their habitat.

88
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,810
But we haven't seen any celestial horses on our way here.

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,370
They usually only come out in the morning and at dusk.

90
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
As long as we find the celestial horses first

91
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,680
and drive them away from the Crown Prince's hunting grounds, we'll succeed.

92
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,760
The celestial horses of Yangjia Ridge are famous throughout the land.

93
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,490
To prevent excessive hunting,

94
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,159
the government has stationed forest rangers

95
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,840
on both the southern and northern mountains of Yangjia Ridge.

96
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,360
Once they discover any poaching,

97
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,080
they immediately report to the authorities.

98
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,640
These forest rangers have lived in the mountains for years

99
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
and are very familiar with the terrain

100
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,320
and the living habits of the celestial horses.

101
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,320
If the Crown Prince and his party want to hunt these horses,

102
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,960
they will certainly seek out the forest rangers first to learn about relevant matters.

103
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,600
We need to go up the mountain to make arrangements.

104
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,280
Zeng Qian.

105
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,720
You'll need to drive the horses away, which will cause a commotion.

106
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,680
If you alert the forest ranger

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,880
and arouse his suspicion...

108
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,040
If we inform the Crown Prince and others about this matter,

109
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,360
our plan will be exposed.

110
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,520
Then why don't we just knock out

111
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,120
or kidnap that Forest Guard and be done with it?

112
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,640
Dr. Xie.

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,680
This stuff is too heavy.

114
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,570
Good thing we knew this Forest Guard can't fight,

115
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,280
otherwise we couldn't have handled him.

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,880
When the Crown Prince arrives at the Forest Guard's quarters

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,120
and doesn't see him,

118
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,320
he will definitely become suspicious.

119
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
I understand.

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,960
You take away Shi Lin,

121
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,680
and I become him.

122
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
But come to think of it,

123
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,680
even if I disguise myself as Shi Lin,

124
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,360
I don't know what he knows.

125
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,760
if the Crown Prince asks me for information,

126
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,360
what do I do if I can't answer?

127
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,690
What you don't know,

128
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,460
someone else naturally will.

129
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,480
Zeng Qian

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,960
Now it's your turn to teach me.

131
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,370
Then you must call me master first.

132
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,440
A male pegasus usually has to defeat another male

133
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,300
before it gets a chance to mate with a female.

134
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,960
Um...

135
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,360
A pegasus's pregnancy typically lasts eight months,

136
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,780
and they never give birth to more than two foals at once.

137
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,680
Shortly after birth, pegasus foals

138
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,770
can stand up and graze on their own.

139
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,480
As a forest ranger,

140
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,159
you have another very important role.

141
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,440
You need to point the Crown Prince and his party

142
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,770
in the right direction,

143
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,580
to the place where we want them to set up camp.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,260
You've talked enough.

145
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,010
Just show us the direction.

146
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,040
Over there.

147
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
If the Crown Prince and his party are in that area

148
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,840
and don't find any traces of the celestial horses,

149
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,500
they will become suspicious.

150
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
When that happens, Zeng Qian,

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,530
you'll need to drive the celestial horses there.

152
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,480
Here.

153
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,770
This is dried and ground wolf dung.

154
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,280
Celestial horses fear wolves.

155
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,640
Scatter this around the area

156
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,170
and it will drive them away.

157
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,080
In the southwest

158
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,560
the celestial horses have been active lately.

159
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,800
But during the day

160
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
they're definitely hiding somewhere sleeping.

161
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,500
Blowing the horn can startle them out

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,760
but you need to be careful when you do it.

163
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,560
That's enough.

164
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,090
Why are you so long-winded?

165
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,140
Thank you, sir.

166
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,100
Thank you, sir.

167
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,120
This damn cat

168
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,080
can't even catch mice

169
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,520
but breaks dishes every day.

170
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,160
Today I'll teach you a lesson

171
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,020
so you'll remember it.

172
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,480
Come out

173
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,200
now!

174
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll kill you!

175
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,810
Come out!

176
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,780
I'll beat you to death!

177
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,280
I'll kill you.

178
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,120
I'll kill you.

179
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,200
I'll kill you.

180
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
They're gone now.

181
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Stop pretending.

182
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,170
Cao Sheng, oh Cao Sheng.

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,130
You almost ruined everything.

184
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
It's not my fault.

185
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,340
It was a rat.

186
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,760
A rat?

187
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,200
Where?

188
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,460
Are you afraid of rats?

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
What am I compared to that?

190
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,240
Just now the Crown Prince

191
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
heard a noise from inside

192
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,040
and immediately hid behind his guards.

193
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,880
The one beside him

194
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,840
must be the Prince of Jingnan.

195
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,200
He was much calmer,

196
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,880
truly worthy of being Bai Liyuan's rival.

197
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,360
What happened to its leg?

198
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
It was injured.

199
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,100
Probably caught in a trap.

200
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,360
Even though there are forest rangers in the mountains,

201
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,820
there are still poachers.

202
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,280
How did it escape from the trap?

203
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,800
It bit off its own leg.

204
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,360
Remember this.

205
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,840
This bowl is for Scholar Chen.

206
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,560
He doesn't eat green onions.

207
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Don't mix them up.

208
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,440
Got it, boss.

209
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,000
Go on.

210
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,080
Mrs. Ji,

211
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,500
thank you for your help today.

212
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,920
It's nothing.

213
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,520
I'll pick some more for you.

214
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,960
You'll need them tonight.

215
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,560
So you're the manager of Qingfeng Restaurant.

216
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
Don't I look like one?

217
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,560
How could anyone tell from the way you're dressed?

218
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I've never seen Young Master Xie handle any business.

219
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,320
So Qingfeng Restaurant

220
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,720
has been relying on you all along.

221
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,040
You flatter me.

222
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,640
The old manager left.

223
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm just filling in temporarily.

224
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,120
How long have you been filling in?

225
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,880
I've been doing it for about 12 or 13...

226
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,760
You've been doing it for over ten days?

227
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,160
It's been 12 or 13 years.

228
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,520
Tongtong.

229
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,920
Don't judge a book

230
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,880
by its cover. That's what it means.

231
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
Who told you to drink so much?

232
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,640
So you lost, just accept it.

233
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
Really now.

234
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,560
We can't afford to offend Master Xie's friends.

235
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,320
Let's go now.

236
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,340
Master San,

237
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,600
are you flush with cash lately?

238
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,860
Don't forget you owe me 2 taels of silver.

239
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,200
The wanted notice from the prefecture.

240
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,920
Let me see.

241
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,360
Those bandits from Cangyun Mountain.

242
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,200
Let me tell you.

243
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,400
He's not a lone bandit.

244
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,480
He...

245
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,160
He only has about 8 or 10 men.

246
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,220
I've called over 20 fellow brothers.

247
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,520
You two,

248
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,120
join us.

249
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,160
Join?

250
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,810
Do you know who they really are?

251
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,160
They're all hardened killers.

252
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,560
I might as well tell you.

253
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,960
These people are likely the Qianji Guards.

254
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
Not just 20,

255
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,440
even 20 more

256
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,200
wouldn't be enough to pick their teeth.

257
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Master San saved your life.

258
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,010
Owing you this small amount

259
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,050
and you have the nerve to ask for it?

260
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,760
Don't be so stingy.

261
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,480
Is what they're saying true

262
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,200
about the Qianji Guards?

263
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,040
The men fear the court will charge them with dereliction of duty.

264
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,300
They'll be fugitives with nowhere to go.

265
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,480
They have elderly parents and young children to support.

266
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,080
Although they've divided 2,000 taels,

267
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,410
it only solves their immediate problems.

268
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,320
So

269
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,040
they've decided to go to Cangyun Mountain

270
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,700
to rob the government silver.

271
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,240
To provide enough money for their families,

272
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,040
so even if they become fugitives

273
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,810
they'll have no worries about those left behind.

274
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,360
But they failed.

275
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,040
Not only did they fail to get the silver,

276
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,440
but some of them were also exposed.

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
However, they've already left Cangyun Mountain,

278
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,480
so it won't be easy for officials to catch them.

279
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,920
I'm worried they won't stop.

280
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,120
If this continues, something bad will happen sooner or later.

281
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,000
Their families will suffer the consequences.

282
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,320
Men die for wealth,

283
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,900
birds die for food.

284
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,120
Chief,

285
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,120
they can't be persuaded.

286
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,520
Melt down this gold badge

287
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,640
and distribute the money to the men.

288
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,840
But this is your commander's token.

289
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,480
The Han Battalion is gone.

290
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,960
What use is a token now?

291
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,290
I don't have anything more valuable to offer.

292
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,280
This is all

293
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,280
I can do for them.

294
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
Even if we reach their camp,

295
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,330
security won't be relaxed.

296
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
How can we break through

297
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,600
dozens of guards and kidnap the Crown Prince?

298
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,080
What if we

299
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,160
set up an ambush where they'll camp?

300
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,560
Feng Buhai has military experience.

301
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,600
He can predict

302
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,080
where the Crown Prince's party will set up camp.

303
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,960
But what kind of place would be suitable for camping

304
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
and also good for hiding?

305
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
You're back so quickly.

306
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Seems you've found a suitable location.

307
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,360
I've checked.

308
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,820
There's an open area here.

309
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,400
And there's a water source nearby,

310
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,640
perfect for setting up camp.

311
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,240
Zeng Qian.

312
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,640
You need to drive the celestial horses there.

313
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,320
Then the horses will lead the prince and his people

314
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,650
to the location where we want them to camp.

315
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,490
This way,

316
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,560
we won't need to break through their defense line.

317
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,640
Because we'll

318
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,490
already be inside their defenses.

319
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,440
This is where the Crown Prince has set up camp.

320
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,920
Feng Buhai will set up an ambush in advance,

321
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,600
seize the right moment to capture the Crown Prince,

322
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,160
and slip away without anyone noticing.

323
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,290
That would be ideal.

324
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,540
But if you're discovered,

325
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,640
what you'll face

326
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,040
is dozens of imperial guards hunting you down.

327
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
We need several rendezvous points.

328
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,600
First one.

329
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,220
Yunniang will be here.

330
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,600
Second one.

331
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,240
Zeng Qian.

332
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,340
You'll be here.

333
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,720
Then Xie Jingtang and I.

334
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,300
I'll have fast horses ready for you at the foot of the mountain.

335
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,520
When would be the best time for us to meet them?

336
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,680
Only when you're certain the person we're rescuing is in trouble,

337
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,520
should you take action.

338
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Don't act rashly.

339
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,920
As for your son's illness,

340
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,520
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

341
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,040
If the great Doctor Zong says so,

342
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,840
then I won't bother asking anyone else.

343
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,160
Have you tried the acupuncture method

344
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,560
I suggested to you?

345
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like drinking poison to quench thirst.

346
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,730
Unless absolutely necessary,

347
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,880
I will never use it.

348
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,920
Cao,

349
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,040
you will use it eventually.

350
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,360
I know you.

351
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,620
Based on my observations of him over the past two years,

352
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,880
his condition shows no signs of worsening.

353
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,880
A thousand-mile dike can be breached by a tiny ant hole.

354
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,800
The hole forms slowly over time,

355
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,800
but the collapse happens in an instant.

356
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,800
How much time

357
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,440
do you think he has left?

358
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,160
It's hard to say,

359
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,360
but one day when he's getting acupuncture or sleeping,

360
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,680
he'll start bleeding from the nose.

361
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,840
What does that mean?

362
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,480
It means

363
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,280
you should prepare for his funeral.

364
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,560
Therefore,

365
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,680
you must find that city

366
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,500
before this symptom appears.

367
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,360
That's the only way to save him.

368
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
These horses

369
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,440
are truly excellent.

370
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,480
They eat so much

371
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,210
they've grazed the grass bare.

372
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,140
What are you doing?

373
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,080
Just daydreaming.

374
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,200
Isn't it obvious?

375
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,160
I've been wondering,

376
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,000
what exactly

377
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,640
did you do before?

378
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,290
What do you mean?

379
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,480
I think you're

380
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,460
quite extraordinary.

381
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,290
You know so many things:

382
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,680
making explosives,

383
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
setting traps,

384
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,680
strategy and military tactics.

385
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,480
When you were young,

386
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,440
you must have suffered a lot learning all these skills.

387
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,280
Unlike me,

388
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,300
I had it too easy as a child,

389
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,240
and now I'm suffering for it.

390
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,810
Actually, when I was young,

391
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,850
I had it pretty easy too.

392
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,160
So you're one of those people who barely needs to study

393
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,290
but still outperforms everyone else?

394
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,960
Let me tell you,

395
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,890
people like that

396
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,420
are the most annoying.

397
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,090
Only to people like you, I suppose.

398
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,280
Since I was little, I've been traveling everywhere with my father.

399
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,740
For the past twenty years,

400
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,290
I've basically spent every day sightseeing.

401
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,010
I can't claim much else,

402
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,480
but I might have gained a bit of experience.

403
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,520
I always thought

404
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,360
my life would continue

405
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,530
as it had been, just traveling around.

406
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,850
Until I came to Dengzhou

407
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,800
and everything changed.

408
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,440
Maybe everyone thinks that way,

409
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,480
believing the good times will last forever.

410
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,890
That's why misfortunes

411
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,820
always catch us off guard.

412
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,440
But not everyone is as clever as you,

413
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,960
knowing everything.

414
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
It seems like nothing can stump you.

415
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,840
I've never attended private school.

416
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,280
Nor have I taken the imperial examinations.

417
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,080
My father would never make me do things I don't want to do.

418
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,480
He taught me many things.

419
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,890
I used to think these things were useless.

420
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,480
But after everything that happened in Dengzhou,

421
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,360
I realized they're actually quite useful.

422
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,080
But I wouldn't say nothing can stump me.

423
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,410
Let's just say that more difficult things

424
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,060
haven't happened yet.

425
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,860
So there are things that could stump you?

426
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,680
Cao Sheng.

427
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,480
I heard you even blew up a dam.

428
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,650
How does everyone know about this?

429
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,920
Never mind that.

430
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,320
The important thing is blowing up the dam.

431
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,200
The dam was so solid.

432
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,660
How did you manage to do it?

433
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,680
Those explosives were developed by my father.

434
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,160
They're more powerful than ordinary gunpowder.

435
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,600
Let's put that aside for now.

436
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,560
This dam-blowing business,

437
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,800
it's so destructive!

438
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,400
Why would you do such a thing?

439
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,490
I was saving people from disaster.

440
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
I was passing by that dam,

441
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,340
and noticed there was a hole in it.

442
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,360
Guess what I saw inside that hole?

443
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,290
What did you see?

444
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,120
A gigantic eye.

445
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,730
Glowing with an eerie green light.

446
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,700
At first I thought it might be a mural.

447
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,400
Until later,

448
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,480
when it blinked.

449
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,280
Then I knew there was something unusual about that dam.

450
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,080
So I planted explosives underneath it

451
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,880
to destroy whatever was inside.

452
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,560
Cao Sheng,

453
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,020
you really are something.

454
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,940
Not only are you destructive,

455
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,330
you also talk nonsense.

456
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,120
You're the one who asked.

457
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,080
I tell you, and you don't believe me.

458
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,440
What you said is too frightening.

459
00:25:59,440 --> 00:25:59,960
A hole?

460
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,840
With a giant eye?

461
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,900
Who wouldn't be scared hearing that?

462
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,920
I wonder how Feng Buhai is doing over there.

463
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,880
He's been hiding there for so long.

464
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,740
Even the slightest noise could get him discovered.

465
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
He used to be a tracker.

466
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,010
Besides tracking and investigation,

467
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,060
stealth and concealment are also his specialties.

468
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
Especially long-term concealment.

469
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,220
Not only can he stay alert,

470
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,560
but when facing any disturbance,

471
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,260
he never loses his composure.

472
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,160
Are you crazy?

473
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,650
How dare you sleep here!

474
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,000
Go now!

475
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,260
The best time to make a move should be during the Chou hour (1-3 AM).

476
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,200
By then, everyone who should be resting will be asleep.

477
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,130
And security will be more relaxed.

478
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,200
What's wrong?

479
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,860
Don't talk.

480
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Someone's there.

481
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,140
There are many people.

482
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,560
Judging by their clothes,

483
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,080
they look like people from Wuji Temple.

484
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,440
Why aren't they moving?

485
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
They must be waiting for something.

486
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,500
Brother Thirteen,

487
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,780
you're looking for me?

488
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,560
Thirteen!

489
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,720
The Crown Prince killed the Prince of Jingnan!

490
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,480
Murder!

491
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,040
Murder!

492
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,480
The Crown Prince killed the Prince of Jingnan!

493
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,520
Help!

494
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,780
Someone come quickly!

495
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,840
The Crown Prince killed the Prince of Jingnan!

496
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,800
Help, someone!

497
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,440
Where is everyone?

498
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Where did they go?

499
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,960
The Crown Prince killed the Prince of Jingnan!

500
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,480
Xin,

501
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,000
Feng Buhai has been discovered.

502
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,760
So many people went up there.

503
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,560
Isn't Feng Buhai as good as dead?

504
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,210
They might not be after him.

505
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,080
I clearly saw that person running this way with the prince.

506
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,210
They must be hiding.

507
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,699
Don't make a sound.

508
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,490
I'll direct you.

509
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,330
You throw the darts.

510
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,250
What direction is this?

511
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,480
Okay.

512
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,000
Up.

513
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,200
You go first.

514
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,720
Can you see where they are?

515
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,080
How is your hearing so good?

516
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,130
I was trained when I worked as a spy.

517
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,540
I thought that was common knowledge.

518
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,080
My darts are soaked in poison.

519
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Knockout powder.

520
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,520
Even if it just grazes the skin,

521
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,720
it's enough to knock them out for hours.

522
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,120
Regarding the murder of the Prince of Jingnan,

523
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,280
you were framed.

524
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,920
We are trying to save you.

525
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,040
If you were the ones who killed the Prince of Jingnan

526
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,170
and then rescued me,

527
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,320
that would only confirm my guilt in his murder.

528
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,480
You only entered the Prince's tent

529
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,410
and shouted after seeing his body.

530
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,400
But those two guards at the entrance lifted the curtain

531
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,060
and immediately claimed you killed the Prince.

532
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,000
Before that,

533
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,200
there were no sounds of fighting or shouting from inside.

534
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,660
Don't you think those guards' reactions

535
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,080
were rather suspicious?

536
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,580
The Prince of Jingnan is dead.

537
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,690
Why are there suddenly so many people down the mountain?

538
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,450
Are they here to rescue him?

539
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,360
I don't think so.

540
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,820
They arrived too quickly.

541
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,720
The elimination of the King of Jingnan

542
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
can be unrelated to Father Emperor.

543
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,840
I acted on my own initiative.

544
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,600
When the time comes, to appease public anger,

545
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,060
Father can strip me of my Crown Prince title,

546
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,080
or even sentence me to death.

547
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,760
It's not surprising you have this idea.

548
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,040
But

549
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,280
are you afraid I have the same idea?

550
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,680
I wouldn't dare, Father.

551
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,330
It seems you had everything planned from the beginning.

552
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,840
Could this be the Emperor's scheme?

553
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,480
What do you mean?

554
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,640
The King of Jingnan's death must have been orchestrated by the Emperor.

555
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,560
The Crown Prince is just a scapegoat.

556
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,680
Both the Crown Prince and the King of Jingnan brought their own guards.

557
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,920
Jingnan's men might not have been able to capture him.

558
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,640
These men in black are the Emperor's backup plan.

559
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,100
To ensure the Crown Prince couldn't escape.

560
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,600
You're a sacrificial pawn now.

561
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
If you want to live,

562
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,400
come with us.

563
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,400
Zeng Qian

564
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,560
Those people who went up there,

565
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,520
did you see them?

566
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,320
Those people have been waiting here for quite some time.

567
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,400
Why did you come back down?

568
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm not sure what happened on the mountain.

569
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,400
I only saw the signal flare

570
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,600
and then I saw a group of people heading up the mountain.

571
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,730
So that signal must have been for them.

572
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,080
I think something has gone wrong with our plan.

573
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,360
But you said before that we shouldn't act rashly,

574
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,120
so I came down to ask what we should do next.

575
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,840
But Cao Sheng said

576
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,040
those people weren't after Feng Buhai.

577
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,480
They gathered at the foot of the mountain in advance.

578
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,160
If their target was Feng Buhai,

579
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,760
it would mean they already knew about our plan.

580
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,760
You and I would definitely be discovered,

581
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,560
and Zeng Qian,

582
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,200
you wouldn't be safe either.

583
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,200
But something must have happened on the mountain.

584
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,560
Either it's the Prince of Jingnan

585
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,690
or the Crown Prince.

586
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,600
If Feng Buhai hasn't made his move yet,

587
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
he should be able to escape unharmed.

588
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,560
I'm afraid he's already made his move,

589
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,680
because Yun Niang hasn't come down yet.

590
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,740
If that's the case,

591
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,880
they'll become the target of everyone.

592
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,410
Trying to escape unscathed

593
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,720
would be very difficult.

594
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,040
They're lined up in a row.

595
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,360
If we break through their line,

596
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,840
we should be able to get out.

597
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,960
There are so many of them.

598
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,690
How can we avoid their pursuit?

599
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,860
Do you have enough darts left?

600
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,480
It's fine.

601
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,530
We'll fight while retreating.

602
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,560
What about him?

603
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,640
I know some martial arts.

604
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,800
I've fought these people at Qingfeng Tower before.

605
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,960
And I've heard about your skills from Zeng Qian.

606
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,760
These are all palace guards.

607
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,620
You couldn't even handle two of them, could you?

608
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,410
Here's the plan.

609
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,120
After we break through their line,

610
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,730
I'll lure them up the mountain,

611
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,540
and you take the Crown Prince down the mountain.

612
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,940
You take the Crown Prince down the mountain.

613
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,060
Where are they?

614
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,570
I just heard something.

615
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,970
They must be hiding.

616
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,130
- Spread out.

617
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,000
- Search!

618
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,290
Why didn't you listen to me?

619
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,000
Compared to taking the Crown Prince down the mountain,

620
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
attracting their pursuit is easier,

621
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,260
and I can handle it.

622
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,240
The task my master gave me

623
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,300
must be completed.

624
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,000
You'll die.

625
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,480
I'm not afraid of death.

626
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,320
I know.

627
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,480
I witnessed it when you fought the armored man before.

628
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,940
You're not afraid of death

629
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,520
because you don't yet understand the meaning of life.

630
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,850
More people are coming.

631
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,920
These palace guards have lived in the palace for a long time.

632
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,080
But I am familiar with the wilderness.

633
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,120
In the dark mountains at night,

634
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,320
I can protect myself.

635
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,280
I'll wait for the right moment to take the Crown Prince down the mountain.

636
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,880
I'll fight while leading them up the mountain.

637
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,400
Listen, smart one,

638
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,520
don't just stand there.

639
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,920
Make a decision quickly.

640
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,400
Everything we're doing now

641
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,130
is mainly to rescue my brother.

642
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,520
I'll go meet them.

643
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,960
I imagined that

644
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,960
the Crown Prince would be carried down.

645
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,890
What's going on?

646
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,090
Where is Feng Buhai?

647
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,760
Feng Buhai said the King of Jingnan is dead,

648
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,360
the Crown Prince was framed,

649
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,800
and he mentioned something about being an abandoned child.

650
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,560
That's all he said.

651
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,690
So according to you,

652
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,360
Feng Buhai is up there alone facing over 100 imperial guards?

653
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,480
If we don't save him,

654
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,610
he's as good as dead.

655
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,250
We must save him,

656
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,040
but we need a plan.

657
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,460
Otherwise we'll just add to the casualties.

658
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,280
Dawn is approaching.

659
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,840
The situation will only get worse for Feng Buhai.

660
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,100
We must go help him now.

661
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,130
I'll go with you.

662
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,120
Wait.

663
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,460
Let's all go together.

664
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,160
We should have gone up when we first heard the signal flare.

665
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,820
We're all going to die anyway.

666
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,240
I have a plan.

667
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,760
I knew nothing could stump you.

668
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,800
What's your plan?

669
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,330
Besiege Wei to rescue Zhao.

670
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
The mountain is Zhao,

671
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,840
so where is Wei?

672
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,960
Wuji Temple.

673
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,100
Attack the Taoist temple?

674
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,440
Even though there are over 100 men here,

675
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,800
there must be even more people left at the temple.

676
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,600
Not to mention that armored monster.

677
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,000
How can we few people surround Wei?

678
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,280
Zeng Qian,

679
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,400
you go up the mountain first.

680
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,640
The rest come back with me.

681
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,900
I'll go with Zeng Qian.

682
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,800
You can't go.

683
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,480
Why not?

684
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,440
Zeng Qian is a hunter.

685
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,600
She knows what to do in the mountains.

686
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,530
You'll only distract her if you go.

687
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,720
Be careful.

688
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,620
Xie Jingtang, please look after him.

689
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,400
This way.

690
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,360
Yun Niang,

691
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,200
how much gunpowder is left in the bundle?

692
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,530
Not much, young master.

693
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:49,960
No need.

694
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,400
I'll do it myself.

695
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,880
Help me find the signal flares.

696
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,440
I have some.

697
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,100
Over there.

698
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,280
Young master.

699
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,520
It's too small.

700
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,240
There's a bigger one.

701
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,760
Keep looking.

702
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,290
Alright.

703
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,400
The red one

704
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,320
is cinnabar.

705
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,720
The green one

706
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,560
is verdigris.

707
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,160
Cao Sheng,

708
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,290
do you need help?

709
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,280
Help me find some verdigris

710
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,200
and cinnabar.

711
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:16,880
Cinnabar is easy to find.

712
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,640
Pharmacies have it.

713
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,800
But where do I find verdigris?

714
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,530
Copper rust.

715
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,400
Got it.

716
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,120
Young master.

717
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:24,980
This will work.

718
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,120
Go with Mr. Xie to find more.

719
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,000
As quickly as possible.

720
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,680
Yes.

721
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,640
Something's wrong!

722
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,440
There's trouble at Wuji Temple.

723
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,320
You few, go help.

724
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:41,880
Send orders.

725
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,800
Have the second team stay behind

726
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,200
and continue searching for the prince.

727
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,960
Everyone else,

728
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,960
return to Wuji Temple immediately.

729
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,880
Tongtong,

730
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,480
Tongtong!

731
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,580
Come here quickly.

732
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,080
Grandma.

733
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,160
Come,

734
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,520
try this on.

735
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,900
It's too short.

736
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,040
Our Tongtong has grown up.

737
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,760
Grandma.

738
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,360
What flower is this?

739
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,680
It smells so nice.

740
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,720
This is jasmine.

741
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,760
Every year when the jasmine blooms,

742
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,880
I make jasmine bracelets for you.

743
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,800
Our little Tongtong

744
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,120
doesn't have as good a memory as I do.

745
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,760
Xiao Bao is here!

746
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,400
Aunt Ji, it's me.

747
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,200
Have you thought about Er Ya's matter?

748
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,120
Don't bring that up now.

749
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,720
I'm here on important business.

750
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,960
You and Tongtong pack up and come with me.

751
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,020
What's happening?

752
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,920
Are we going to the seaside?

753
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,400
Guanying has arranged everything.

754
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,560
Just come with me.

755
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,940
Has something happened to Guanying?

756
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,080
He's fine.

757
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,840
I noticed he was troubled last night.

758
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,440
What exactly happened to him?

759
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,960
He's really fine.

760
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,000
Just come with me first.

761
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,530
He's waiting for you there.

762
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,000
If you don't explain clearly,

763
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,560
we won't go with you.

764
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,040
Really, nothing's wrong.

765
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,760
He just wants

766
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,200
to take you out for a change of scenery.

767
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,320
Xiao Bao.

768
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,680
Though my eyes can't see clearly,

769
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,640
my heart isn't blind.

770
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,560
You'd better tell the truth.

771
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,120
You can't hide anything from me.

772
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,010
Guanying left a letter.

773
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,480
He instructed me

774
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,240
to give it to you only when we reached the seaside.

775
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,960
But since you insist on knowing

776
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,160
before you'll leave,

777
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,520
I'll read it to you.

778
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,160
Read it.

779
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,920
Mother, forgive my unfilial behavior.

780
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,260
There are many things I couldn't tell you in person,

781
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,050
so I can only write them in this letter.

782
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,970
It's easy to pick up the pen,

783
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,760
but each word weighs heavily on me.

784
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,370
I've kept a secret from you for a long time.

785
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,820
Today, forced by circumstances,

786
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,800
I must finally reveal it.

787
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,520
Mother,

788
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,960
I am not Liu Guanying.

789
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,480
I

790
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,440
am Feng Buhai.

791
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,410
Before coming to Dengzhou,

792
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,240
we were both from Jiazhou.

793
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,540
At that time and place,

794
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,320
there was Prince Yu, the Emperor's uncle,

795
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,650
who imposed heavy taxes

796
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,200
and ruled tyrannically.

797
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,480
The gentry organized common people to petition the Emperor,

798
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,810
attempting to expose Prince Yu's crimes.

799
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,560
However,

800
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,560
before these people could even leave Jiazhou,

801
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,720
they all met with unnatural deaths.

802
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,490
My father and Guanying's father were among them.

803
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,160
Prince Yu and the governor were in cahoots.

804
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,480
The prefectural office reported it was the work of mountain bandits.

805
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,080
The matter was eventually swept under the rug.

806
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,120
Guanying and I were neighbors since childhood.

807
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,040
We also studied under the same master.

808
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,440
Our friendship was deep.

809
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,320
Because our fathers were killed by Prince Yu,

810
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,920
we were overcome with grief and anger.

811
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,650
We made a pact to assassinate Prince Yu together.

812
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,600
The assassination went rather smoothly.

813
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,760
Prince Yu was killed,

814
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,160
and we managed to escape.

815
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,120
But no plan is foolproof.

816
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,240
The Prince of Yu found Guanying

817
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,680
based on the evidence at the scene

818
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,720
and arrested him.

819
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,800
Aunt Ji, you knew beforehand

820
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,680
about our assassination attempt on the King of Yu.

821
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,800
Before Guanying was arrested,

822
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,960
you repeatedly instructed him

823
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,520
not to reveal my involvement,

824
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,360
saying that even if death was inevitable,

825
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,890
he should not implicate me.

826
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,800
Don't be disloyal and betray your word.

827
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,460
Therefore,

828
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,520
despite severe torture,

829
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,180
Guanying remained silent

830
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,010
and refused to reveal my involvement.

831
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,920
To force Guanying to comply,

832
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,700
The prince intends to use your life as leverage.

833
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,440
You know Guanying's temperament well.

834
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,440
If the prince tortures and humiliates you in front of him,

835
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,100
he will have no choice but to reveal my identity.

836
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,260
And even if Guanying tells the truth,

837
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,780
you and your son still won't escape harm.

838
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,320
Three people dying

839
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,040
is worse than saving one.

840
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,640
So,

841
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,880
during the escort,

842
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,520
you jumped off the cliff.

843
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,440
To save Guanying,

844
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,240
I did everything I could

845
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,640
and fought my way into the prison to attempt a jailbreak.

846
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,170
However,

847
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,760
I was captured.

848
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,000
Fortunately, an imperial envoy arrived in Jiazhou.

849
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,860
The people came forward to expose Yu Wang's crimes.

850
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,600
Yu Wang and his followers were all executed.

851
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,880
Guanying and I were released.

852
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,580
After that,

853
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,740
we found you unconscious at the bottom of the cliff.

854
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,920
When you fell from the cliff,

855
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,450
the trees broke your fall and saved your life.

856
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,610
But you suffered a severe head injury,

857
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,440
causing blindness in both eyes.

858
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,880
The imperial envoy was moved by what Guanying and I did.

859
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,140
He allowed Guanying and me to follow him.

860
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,330
After arriving in the capital,

861
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,160
Guanying and I were assigned different duties.

862
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,320
Years later,

863
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,040
we joined the military campaign

864
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,570
and reunited in Tabai City.

865
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,960
But due to a military defeat,

866
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,120
he unfortunately lost his life.

867
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,000
To me, Guanying was

868
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,520
not just a comrade,

869
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,640
but a friend,

870
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,140
and more importantly, a brother.

871
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,080
And you, his mother,

872
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,960
have already lost your eyesight because of me.

873
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,080
I didn't want you to suffer the pain of losing a son.

874
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,680
Tongtong is still young.

875
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,420
I didn't want her to suffer this blow either,

876
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,320
as I know all too well the pain of losing a father.

877
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,240
Therefore,

878
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,440
I took matters into my own hands,

879
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,720
disguised my appearance and voice

880
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,840
to impersonate Guanying,

881
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,400
to fulfill his filial duties

882
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,330
and responsibilities as a father.

883
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,560
Although this was merely a temporary illusion

884
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,560
created by my wishful thinking.

885
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,640
But I truly have long considered you my mother

886
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,760
and Tongtong my daughter.

887
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,220
Several years have passed in the blink of an eye.

888
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,880
As you said,

889
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,720
I'm reclusive by nature,

890
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,920
not fond of speaking,

891
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,120
and have always been a loner.

892
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,040
Unexpectedly, I've made a few close friends recently.

893
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,080
Being with them,

894
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,240
in those moments,

895
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,680
I seem to return to the days I spent with Guanying.

896
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,160
Right now,

897
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,320
they've encountered a difficult situation

898
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,720
that's quite dangerous.

899
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,120
The weight of friendship

900
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,720
should be above all else.

901
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,050
After much consideration,

902
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,180
I've decided to help them.

903
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,680
Because I understand

904
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,560
what I mean to them now

905
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,180
is just like what Guanying and you

906
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,280
meant to me back then.

907
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,850
The outcome of this journey is uncertain.

908
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,840
I leave these few words

909
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,760
as my farewell.

910
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,400
By the time you receive this,

911
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,280
I may no longer be here.

912
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,560
Mother,

913
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,320
please allow me to call you that once more.

914
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:48,800
Mother.

915
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,130
Forgive me for deceiving you all these years,

916
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:59,040
and please forgive me for being unable to fulfill my filial duties to you in this lifetime.

917
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,300
If there is a next life,

918
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,280
I will surely be Guanying's brother by blood

919
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,160
and we'll take care of you together.

920
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,280
Feng Buhai

921
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,760
[Final words]
