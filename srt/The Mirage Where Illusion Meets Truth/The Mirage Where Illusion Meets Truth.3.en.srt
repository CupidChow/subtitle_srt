1
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,480
It's too far.

2
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,240
I can reach it.

3
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,370
You might not hit it.

4
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,239
Deer have a keen sense of smell.

5
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,920
Going from this direction is downwind.

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,400
They can easily smell us.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,100
So we need to circle around from the side.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,480
Sister.

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,560
That deer was strange.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
Why didn't it have antlers?

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
Deer shed their antlers and fur every year.

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,720
Its antlers will grow back soon.

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,600
They grow back so quickly.

14
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,920
Raise your hand a bit higher.

15
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,880
Relax your shoulders.

16
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,539
Don't rush.

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,080
Again.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,280
Sis.

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
I hit it!

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,479
I see blood.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,850
But you didn't hit a vital spot.

22
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm sorry, sis.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,920
I was too hasty.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
I should have listened to you.

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,080
That's not the most important thing.

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,160
What matters is

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,720
your shoulders were too stiff when drawing the bow.

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,640
Not relaxed enough.

29
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,500
Don't force it.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,280
Axin.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,040
Wait for me here.

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,960
Don't wander off.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,560
I'll go call him back for you.

34
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,120
Axin!

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,440
Axin!

36
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,240
Axin!

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Axin!

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,440
Axin!

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
Axin!

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,280
Axin!

41
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,360
Axin!

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
Axin!

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,040
Sis.

44
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,640
Didn't I tell you to wait for me where you were?

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,900
Why didn't you listen?

46
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Right after you left, I saw a deer.

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
I chased it but lost track of it.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,160
And I got lost too.

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,560
Do you know how deep this forest is?

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,079
What if you'd encountered a wild beast?

51
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,880
Do you know how dangerous it was?

52
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,079
I've never caught a deer before.

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,960
I just wanted to make you happy for once.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,840
Sis.

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,400
I was wrong.

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,760
Are you okay?

58
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,240
I'm fine.

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
Sister, look.

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,740
These are your favorite flowers.

61
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,080
Promise me,

62
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
you won't do this again.

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,040
Understand?

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,640
Let's go.

65
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,740
Let me do it.

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,400
Axin.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,090
Have you forgotten?

68
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,540
Father told us before he died,

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
we don't hunt wolves.

70
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,240
Sis.

71
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,120
Here.

72
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,800
Sister,

73
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,210
what's this for?

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,530
These two whistles, one for each of us.

75
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,840
Blow it when you want to find me.

76
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,120
When I blow mine,

77
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,320
you need to come find me right away.

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,480
Got it?

79
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
That's great, sis.

80
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,280
Now I won't get lost anymore,

81
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,340
and you won't lose track of me either.

82
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,810
Uncle Wu, have you seen my brother?

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,200
Your brother is missing too.

84
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,840
Yes.

85
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,960
Just in the blink of an eye,

86
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,680
About this tall, right?

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,840
how could he disappear?

88
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,560
Xiaoqiang!

89
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,080
Xiaoqiang!

90
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,260
Have you seen a child about this tall?

91
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
Haven't seen him.

92
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,580
I'm so worried.

93
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,880
Have you seen a child?

94
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,600
About this tall with a round face.

95
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,000
No, I haven't.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,760
The person is gone.

97
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm worried sick.

98
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,720
Have you seen

99
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,410
this little beggar?

100
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,090
Didn't he just run past?

101
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,640
Have you seen anyone?

102
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,960
Have you seen my wife?

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,440
She's about this tall

104
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,170
wearing a cyan-colored dress.

105
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,960
Have you seen my wife?

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,520
She suddenly disappeared.

107
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,120
She was wearing a cyan-colored dress.

108
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,000
About this tall.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,730
Auntie Ding,

110
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Tongtong,

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,600
have you seen my wife?

112
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,400
No, I haven't.

113
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,160
Wasn't she just here a moment ago?

114
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,840
Tongtong!

115
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,760
I turned around and she was gone.

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,560
She's gone.

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
Have you checked at home?

118
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,520
Tongtong!

119
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,600
Go look for her quickly.

120
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,320
Advisor.

121
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,880
Excuse me, please.

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,480
We're being wrongfully accused!

123
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,360
We had just entered

124
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,960
when they started swinging knives at our heads.

125
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,400
That's right.

126
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
We had to defend ourselves.

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,880
It was self-defense.

128
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,640
We had no idea who they were.

129
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,240
Exactly.

130
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
We just came here looking for the little beggar.

131
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,320
They wouldn't listen to our explanation.

132
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,960
When we tried to leave,

133
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,290
they wouldn't let us go.

134
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,800
Yes.

135
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,130
Where's Wang Hu?

136
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't see him.

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,760
How could you miss someone that big?

138
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,620
Did you see him?

139
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,770
That bastard must have snuck away.

140
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,640
You guys go look for him.

141
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,720
Check if someone's missing.

142
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,240
Yes, sir.

143
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,960
His spiked club is still here.

144
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
That's right.

145
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,780
But where is he?

146
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,400
Sir.

147
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
We found a secret passage over there.

148
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,520
Two people just regained consciousness.

149
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,120
They killed themselves too.

150
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Where do you think you're going?

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Acting like you're real officials.

152
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,280
Stay put.

153
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
Steamed buns for sale!

154
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,360
Mr. Li,

155
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,640
have you seen Tongtong?

156
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,600
No,

157
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,680
I haven't seen him.

158
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,480
Tongtong!

159
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Tongtong!

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,920
You're the one

161
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,720
who sells vegetable buns.

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,400
Have you seen my brother?

163
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,860
Have you seen my daughter?

164
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,600
Little One-Eye,

165
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
so this is where you've been hiding.

166
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,960
Don't run!

167
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,120
Master.

168
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,520
Master.

169
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,960
What's going on here?

170
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,400
I only arrived half a step before you.

171
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,420
I'm wondering what's happening too.

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
What's the situation on your end?

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,260
Has Tang'er returned?

174
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,760
Young Master.

175
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,000
Young Master.

176
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,880
Not found yet.

177
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,040
You.

178
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,080
Master.

179
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,140
Master.

180
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,850
Are you feeling better?

181
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,940
I can't get better.

182
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,720
Tang'er hasn't been redeemed.

183
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
And now there's such a serious murder case.

184
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,280
What am I supposed to do?

185
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,320
Master.

186
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,690
This night demon only wants money,

187
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,920
not lives.

188
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,580
The young master will be fine.

189
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,840
Besides,

190
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,680
the money is still there.

191
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,040
Ye Xiao will come back for it.

192
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,080
Forget it.

193
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,360
Let's go to the prison.

194
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,880
Two Qianji Guards died outside.

195
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,410
We can't let anything happen to the important prisoner inside.

196
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,520
You two stay here.

197
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,560
Yes.

198
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,240
Stay put.

199
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,440
This is an important prisoner of the court.

200
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,040
What should we do?

201
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,880
Sir,

202
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,240
don't worry.

203
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
I'll handle them.

204
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,600
First, tell me

205
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,290
what exactly happened.

206
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,640
Or maybe you should tell me what happened.

207
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,160
Let me deal with them.

208
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,930
That's the Imperial Guard.

209
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,880
What's wrong, young master?

210
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,040
Officer.

211
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,560
My brother went out this morning

212
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,040
and suddenly disappeared.

213
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,600
What should I do?

214
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,160
My wife is missing.

215
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,120
My sister also disappeared this morning.

216
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,800
Really?

217
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,920
I tried to wake her up this morning.

218
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
My son!

219
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,280
So many people across the city have just vanished.

220
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,040
Officer, you must do something about this!

221
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,000
Please help me find my child.

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,520
Yes, sir. Please help us find them.

223
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,320
Walking all the way here this early morning,

224
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,480
I did hear about people going missing.

225
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,200
But

226
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,800
why are there so many people?

227
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Use the back door.

228
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,120
Sir.

229
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
So many people disappearing at once

230
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
is very strange.

231
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,120
Also,

232
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,480
that mirage that wouldn't disappear for days

233
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,880
is also gone now.

234
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,880
Is this really just a coincidence?

235
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,280
You haven't even sorted out what's happening on the ground,

236
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,920
and you're worrying about the sky?

237
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Just focus on what's in front of you.

238
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,840
I'll have someone record all the missing persons.

239
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,300
I'm talking about Tang'er's matter.

240
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,560
Right.

241
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,420
I'll assign more people to investigate right away.

242
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,280
Miss, do you know what's going on?

243
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
My daughter suddenly disappeared!

244
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,960
If I didn't have connections with the magistrate's office,

245
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,090
and they trusted me,

246
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,520
we'd all be in jail today.

247
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,480
Do you think it's possible

248
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,920
that the county office is too busy

249
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,200
to even bother with us?

250
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,600
Where are you going?

251
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,130
Sit down.

252
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,540
I need to explain something to everyone.

253
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,320
Although we don't have to go to jail now,

254
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,120
Master Geng has instructed us

255
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,720
that before they figure out who those people from Xuan Seven are,

256
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,000
none of us can leave Dengzhou.

257
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,000
We jianghu people live by our reputation.

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,800
They've shown respect to me, Hu San,

259
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,200
so we can't make things difficult for them.

260
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,960
Right?

261
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,160
Isn't that right?

262
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,400
Yes.

263
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Daozi,

264
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,720
come here.

265
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,440
What's wrong?

266
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,480
Is Wang Hu back?

267
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Haven't seen him.

268
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,600
What's wrong, Boss?

269
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,040
Lost someone again?

270
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,880
How dare you speak to Boss like that?

271
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,800
It's a misunderstanding.

272
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,840
I said that because that female ghostwriter

273
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,359
is also looking for her foolish brother.

274
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,119
Her brother has disappeared too.

275
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,800
What the hell do I care?

276
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,329
Get lost!

277
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,240
Brothers,

278
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,440
have you seen Wang Hu?

279
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,440
No, we haven't.

280
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,720
Fellow heroes,

281
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,880
has anyone seen

282
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,079
a master skilled in the art of Qimen Dunjia?

283
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,040
Young Master Xie,

284
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
weren't you looking for a beggar?

285
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,200
Why are you now looking for a master?

286
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,079
Why so many questions?

287
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,010
For this matter,

288
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,480
I'll pay separately.

289
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,560
Qimen Dunjia

290
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,960
is profound and complex.

291
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,300
What kind are you looking for?

292
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,760
The kind that can kill from a distance,

293
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,320
whose hand can go from here

294
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,000
through the chest

295
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,530
and come out the other side.

296
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
Then I'll trouble you all

297
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,080
to keep an eye out for such a master

298
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,120
while you're helping me find the little beggar.

299
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,200
If you find any leads,

300
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,130
I, Xie Jingtang,

301
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,000
will reward you generously.

302
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,360
As long as Young Master Xie asks,

303
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,400
we will

304
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,080
do our utmost.

305
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,720
Do your best.

306
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,040
Guanying,

307
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,200
you're back.

308
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,360
Mom,

309
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,080
I'm back.

310
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,660
Where's Tongtong?

311
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Why isn't she with you?

312
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,560
Old Yang from the oil shop has a niece visiting from Qingzhou.

313
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,640
Tongtong is getting along well with her

314
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,080
and wants to stay overnight at their place.

315
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Tongtong finally made a friend.

316
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,140
That's wonderful.

317
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,920
Guanying,

318
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,160
tell Tongtong

319
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,480
to bring that girl to our home sometime.

320
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,120
Okay.

321
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,760
Next time.

322
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,840
Boss,

323
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,320
I've brought the person here.

324
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,050
Go back and give our two brothers a proper burial.

325
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,760
I'll handle Cao Jiande myself.

326
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,840
You're just injured.

327
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,200
Why don't we-

328
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,000
It's nothing.

329
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,080
That's the young master.

330
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,080
How did my father die?

331
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,480
We'll find out even if you don't tell us.

332
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,420
A strange man descended from the sky.

333
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,480
He wore unusual armor,

334
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,720
neither quite iron nor metal,

335
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,840
and his fighting style was extremely bizarre.

336
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,480
My two Qianji Guard brothers

337
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,410
had their chests pierced from a distance.

338
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,140
We couldn't even get close to him.

339
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,450
Stay out of this matter.

340
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,440
I will avenge

341
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,460
our master myself.

342
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,240
More than ten years ago,

343
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,680
I was rescued by my master

344
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,040
and brought to the manor

345
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
to learn martial arts and literature.

346
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,640
I always thought I was the only one at the manor,

347
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,420
but I never expected Lin Han came from there too.

348
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,800
She brought the master's body outside the city.

349
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,600
She must have wanted to bury him.

350
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,520
It seems my father's escort to Dengzhou

351
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,920
was his own arrangement.

352
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,280
Lin Han was just following orders.

353
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,720
Could it be that the master

354
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,560
was deliberately captured just like you,

355
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,520
on purpose?

356
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,640
But why?

357
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,840
Do you know,

358
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,800
sometimes killing is done to save lives.

359
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,840
Sometimes saving people

360
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
actually harms them.

361
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,440
I heard Cao Zhong and the others also committed suicide.

362
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,400
We planned to catch the assassins

363
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,320
to disrupt their plans.

364
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,160
We wanted to wait until officials arrived

365
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,020
so they would either try to escape

366
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,600
or surrender.

367
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Unexpectedly...

368
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,120
My father flooded Dengzhou City

369
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,360
at all costs.

370
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,600
I just don't understand

371
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,080
why he chose to be involved

372
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,210
when he deliberately had Lin Han escort him to Dengzhou.

373
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,610
It is indeed difficult to understand.

374
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,920
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

375
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,380
What's most important now

376
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,420
is to find my father's killer.

377
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,600
That armored stranger.

378
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,880
Lin Hanke said

379
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,650
his fighting skills are very strange.

380
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,600
Young Master,

381
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,780
why don't I investigate instead?

382
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,960
By the way,

383
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,560
when I passed by the Fushou Shop today,

384
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,400
I heard that

385
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,000
Xie Jingtang is offering a reward

386
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,600
for someone skilled in the art of Qimen Dunjia.

387
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,800
They say that person can kill from a distance,

388
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,880
pulling their hand out through someone's chest.

389
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,280
Isn't that exactly what Lin Han described?

390
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,020
Would Xie Jingtang have any leads about this armored monster?

391
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,760
Meeting you deepened my feelings,

392
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,840
I only wish we'd met sooner.

393
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,040
I've known thousands of people,

394
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,240
yet none compare

395
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,160
to you.

396
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,120
Your sweet talk is like honey all day long.

397
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,920
Then let me share some with you,

398
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,080
so you can taste the sweetness too.

399
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Stop it.

400
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,400
If only I could hold you like this every day.

401
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Not like now,

402
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,370
sneaking around in secret.

403
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,720
Xing'er.

404
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,640
Have you thought about that matter?

405
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,640
I...

406
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,800
My dear Xing'er,

407
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,840
what are you still hesitating about?

408
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,440
I've been pouring my heart out to you.

409
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Can't you feel it?

410
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,520
I can feel it.

411
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
It's partly my fault.

412
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,960
Our family business has been having some issues lately,

413
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,920
and we've been robbed by the Yeye thieves.

414
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,120
Things are really difficult right now.

415
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,770
My dear Xing'er,

416
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,320
if you help me get through this difficult time,

417
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,920
I can marry you,

418
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,640
and treat you a thousand times better in the future.

419
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,120
I really don't understand

420
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,720
what's so good about this piece of junk.

421
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,120
I wouldn't take it even if it was given to me.

422
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,000
Then tell me,

423
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,560
why does their family treasure this thing so much?

424
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,440
Who knows?

425
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,080
I can never figure out

426
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,540
what you men are thinking.

427
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,640
I think

428
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
this thing

429
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
is just like you,

430
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,580
there's more to it than meets the eye.

431
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,080
I'm not a thing.

432
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,320
You're the one who's not decent.

433
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,800
Well,

434
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,480
I'll have to show you just how indecent I can be.

435
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,960
Young mistress.

436
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,840
What is it?

437
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,440
Are you in a rush to be reborn?

438
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,080
The young master is back.

439
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:06,680
Quick,

440
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,440
run!

441
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,800
Go stall him.

442
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,640
Yes.

443
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,730
This way.

444
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,120
Why are you back?

445
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,850
What? Is my return surprising?

446
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,940
Didn't Father say you were taken by the night demon?

447
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,200
Well, I'm back safe and sound, aren't I?

448
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,560
It happens to be the 15th today,

449
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,120
so I came back to offer incense.

450
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
You only come back on the 1st and 15th of the month.

451
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
It's better not to come back.

452
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,880
So I don't have to argue with you every day.

453
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,600
Argue?

454
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,960
Aren't we arguing because you never come home?

455
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
Always fooling around with everyone,

456
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,960
causing trouble.

457
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,680
I can't even hold my head up in public.

458
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,120
Enough.

459
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,680
Here we go again.

460
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,480
Go get me some clothes to change into.

461
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,880
I saw Father heading to the ancestral hall.

462
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,320
I'll go surprise him.

463
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,600
My Tang'er may be stubborn and willful,

464
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,800
acting recklessly,

465
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,920
but he's not bad at heart.

466
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,360
It's all my fault.

467
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,400
He's my only child,

468
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,120
so I've spoiled him too much.

469
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,760
I've been too busy with official duties

470
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,490
and neglected his upbringing.

471
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,960
Ancestors!

472
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,920
Before my ancestors,

473
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
I shouldn't lie.

474
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
I wasn't busy with official duties at all.

475
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,480
I simply failed to discipline him.

476
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,480
Yes.

477
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,840
I know I'm a local official responsible for the people.

478
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,000
All these years,

479
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,600
I've just been getting by,

480
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,090
taking my salary without doing my job.

481
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Though I haven't oppressed the people,

482
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,800
I haven't kept my hands clean either.

483
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,080
Indeed,

484
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,920
I know

485
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,800
many common folk

486
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,600
criticize me behind my back,

487
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,760
saying like father, like son.

488
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,680
To be honest,

489
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,280
Tang'er has become what he is today

490
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
because he's following my example.

491
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,100
Ancestors,

492
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,680
my ancestors,

493
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,480
if you show your divine power

494
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,720
and bring my Tang'er back safely,

495
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,440
I, your unworthy descendant Xie Kui, will be diligent and practical,

496
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,840
fulfill my duties,

497
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,440
do more for the common people,

498
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,680
and discipline Tang'er strictly.

499
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,120
I won't let him misbehave again.

500
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,360
I'm back.

501
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,400
Tang'er!

502
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,240
You'll be the death of me!

503
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,500
What's wrong, Father?

504
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,160
Are you hurt?

505
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,480
No,

506
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,280
he let me go.

507
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,080
Good.

508
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,720
Thank heavens.

509
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,560
Ancestors,

510
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,600
thank you for answering my prayers!

511
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Quickly, kneel down and kowtow!

512
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,300
Thank you, ancestors.

513
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,240
Thank you for showing your divine presence.

514
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,640
Thank you, ancestors.

515
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,600
For bringing my son home safely.

516
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,760
Father.

517
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
It must be the work of Yexiao.

518
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,880
Our family heirloom isn't made of gold, silver, or jade.

519
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,160
Although we consider it important,

520
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,760
it wouldn't be worth much if we tried to sell it.

521
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,400
It has been passed down in our Xie family for generations.

522
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,800
It must be important.

523
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,400
To those who don't understand its value, it's worthless.

524
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,720
But what if someone who recognizes its value sees it?

525
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,760
Then it would be priceless.

526
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,160
Now I understand why he let you come back.

527
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,720
Capturing you was just a ploy.

528
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,800
It's called a diversion.

529
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,160
His real purpose

530
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,440
was to steal our family heirloom.

531
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,740
That can't be, Father.

532
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,400
We've never told outsiders about the heirloom.

533
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,960
And it's always been kept in the drawer at the ancestral hall.

534
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,890
Only family members know about it.

535
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,920
It was an inside job.

536
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,840
An inside job?

537
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,040
Me,

538
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,520
you,

539
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,280
or your wife?

540
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,040
How is that possible?

541
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,680
But I'm thinking,

542
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,720
people from the county office can still come here, right?

543
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,560
This place needs to be cleaned, doesn't it?

544
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,040
These offerings need to be replaced, don't they?

545
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,760
Did someone find it

546
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,520
and take it away?

547
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
That makes sense.

548
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,000
I need to arrange for someone to investigate this.

549
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,360
Are you free these days?

550
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,840
I'm

551
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,680
extremely busy.

552
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,410
I have a heap of legal troubles.

553
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,120
Let Secretary Geng handle the investigation.

554
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,160
I'm leaving now.

555
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,240
Thank you.

556
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,240
What times are these?

557
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,960
The more we eat, the more vegetarian it gets.

558
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,720
Eating too much meat makes you lose hair.

559
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,480
What are you talking about?

560
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,520
You're asking for a beating, aren't you?

561
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Young Master Xie.

562
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,320
You don't seem to be in high spirits.

563
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,400
If something's bothering you, tell us.

564
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,760
Let us brothers help share your burden.

565
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,720
Right, brothers?

566
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,680
Yes.

567
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,660
It's like this.

568
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,480
My family...

569
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,780
Never mind.

570
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,920
As for you all,

571
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,120
just focus on helping me find that little beggar

572
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,520
and that master of the ancient divination art.

573
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,050
Alright?

574
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,760
Daozi,

575
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,800
bring these gentlemen another dish.

576
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,160
Enjoy.

577
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,960
Rest assured, Young Master Xie.

578
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,130
Don't shout.

579
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,240
I need to ask you some questions.

580
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,800
Miss,

581
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,690
what would you like to know?

582
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,560
Please ask.

583
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,120
I'm Xie Jingtang.

584
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,480
Miss,

585
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I won't run away

586
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
or shout anymore.

587
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,040
Please ask me anything you want to know.

588
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,820
Where have you seen that armored man?

589
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,680
Do you think Wang Hu disappeared

590
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,240
mysteriously like those others?

591
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,840
What's really going on here?

592
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,040
There were so many people that day,

593
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,240
yet not one person saw how he vanished.

594
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
When those people suddenly slit their throats,

595
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
everyone was terrified.

596
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,040
Who had time to keep an eye on him?

597
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,840
Mr. Hu.

598
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,080
Wang Hu is gone now,

599
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,490
why don't we team up?

600
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,080
Let's forget about the little beggar.

601
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,940
It's better to find the one who knows mystical arts.

602
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,760
But this person won't be easy to deal with.

603
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
Ripping out hearts from a distance...

604
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
It's terrifying just to hear about it.

605
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,120
What kind of people is Young Master Xie asking us to find?

606
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,400
None of them are normal.

607
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,199
Exactly.

608
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,880
Forget about it.

609
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,739
Let's just do the job and get paid.

610
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,120
Where is your master Mr. Xie?

611
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,159
I need to speak with him.

612
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,760
Upstairs.

613
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,960
In the premium suite.

614
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,920
Young master,

615
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,199
how did Xie Jingtang find out about the Iron Man?

616
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,800
We had him tied up that day.

617
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,719
I'm more interested in finding out who that Iron Man really is.

618
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,520
Why did he kill my father?

619
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,240
All right, Yunniang.

620
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,800
Use this back door.

621
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,040
I'll wait for you here.

622
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,570
Go meet Xie Jingtang alone.

623
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,320
I'm afraid of running into Zeng Qian

624
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,920
and causing complications.

625
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,520
You've been talking all this time,

626
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,480
but this Iron Man thing,

627
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,280
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.

628
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,780
There's no reason for me to lie to you now.

629
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,930
Yunniang, stop!

630
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,490
I have something to say.

631
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,800
If you don't believe me,

632
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,930
you can handcuff me.

633
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,920
What good would handcuffs do with you?

634
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,720
True.

635
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,960
If I wanted to escape,

636
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,040
I had plenty of chances on the way here.

637
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,640
Why would I come to Dengzhou?

638
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,100
Don't you want to know why?

639
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,530
Actually...

640
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,080
Young master.

641
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,480
Why are you so irritable?

642
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,660
What's your relationship with that iron-armored man?

643
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,720
Miss,

644
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,850
I've told you a hundred times already.

645
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,920
I don't know that iron-armored man you're talking about.

646
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,040
Then why are you looking for him?

647
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,240
Who's looking for him?

648
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,600
I've been looking for a one-eyed little beggar.

649
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,400
What else?

650
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,960
Also, I'm looking for someone

651
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,680
who knows the ancient magic arts and can extract hearts from a distance.

652
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,640
You mean

653
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,720
the master I've been looking for is

654
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,980
the iron-armored man?

655
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
The thing is,

656
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,080
how did you know about this?

657
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,440
You just said he would wake up soon,

658
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,500
but it's been almost half an hour now.

659
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,010
Should I wake him up?

660
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,080
Please wait a little longer.

661
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,140
He'll wake up soon.

662
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,820
Is he faking it?

663
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,080
No, he's...

664
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
So he is faking it.

665
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,080
My young master

666
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,620
has a strange illness.

667
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,720
He occasionally faints like this suddenly.

668
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,320
And then

669
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,600
I passed out.

670
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,000
Are you kidding me?

671
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,560
Everything I said is true.

672
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,720
Actually...

673
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,380
Actually, I have narcolepsy.

674
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,930
Are you okay now?

675
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,440
I'm fine.

676
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,970
She just said you were sick.

677
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,440
Well, narcolepsy is a kind of illness.

678
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,200
It happens anywhere, anytime.

679
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,880
I fall asleep without warning.

680
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,740
There's nothing I can do about it.

681
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,330
I don't believe you.

682
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,200
I think you're just pretending.

683
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,800
Look.

684
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,210
It's right here.

685
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,880
I didn't lie to you, did I?

686
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,480
So this was drawn by that little beggar you mentioned?

687
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,880
This is where he lives.

688
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,240
It must be his drawing.

689
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,600
Although this drawing isn't very skillful,

690
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,930
but when you think about it,

691
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,410
it's actually quite frightening.

692
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,960
He must have witnessed how that carpenter died,

693
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,460
so he ran back here and drew it.

694
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,660
If that's the case,

695
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,740
these days,

696
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,300
he hasn't been hiding from me,

697
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,530
but from that armored monster.

698
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,600
He must be terrified,

699
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,330
that's why he ran away desperately when he saw me.

700
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,320
But why

701
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
did he only draw this?

702
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,560
Why didn't he draw the murderer,

703
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,640
that armored monster you mentioned?

704
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,400
Miss.

705
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,800
Can I go now?

706
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,360
So you're saying

707
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,160
you deliberately let me catch you?

708
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,560
You need to escort me to the Ministry of Justice.

709
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,080
Dengzhou is on the way.

710
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,740
You'll definitely stop here.

711
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
And your purpose?

712
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,920
I want to use you

713
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,970
to rescue my father.

714
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,240
I learned that the Qianji Guards are going to

715
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,120
transfer my father to Dengzhou County jail.

716
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,280
My plan was to escape from your custody,

717
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,200
leave clues for you,

718
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,930
and lead you to the county jail.

719
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,120
If my rescue plan failed,

720
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,200
you would step in to help.

721
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,370
But they're the Qianji Guards!

722
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,200
What makes you think I would

723
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,520
get into conflict with them for your sake?

724
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,450
You're a hunter.

725
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,340
You won't let your prey fall into someone else's hands.

726
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,040
Last night I did help you distract the Qianji Guards.

727
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,600
But judging by your appearance,

728
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,800
you don't seem to have successfully rescued your father.

729
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,000
Yes.

730
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,730
My father died tragically.

731
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,440
Forgive my poor judgment.

732
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,480
The way you all look now,

733
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,720
I can't tell what's real and what's fake.

734
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,920
You're going too far.

735
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,360
Too far?

736
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,640
Who's really going too far?

737
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,440
If it weren't for your so-called plan,

738
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,280
my brother and I wouldn't have come to Dengzhou,

739
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,010
and he wouldn't be missing now.

740
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,120
Zeng Xin is missing too?

741
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,440
Stop pretending.

742
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
Let me tell you,

743
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,440
if he can't be found,

744
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,820
you won't get away with it.

745
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,920
I'll help you find Zeng Xin.

746
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,040
Thanks,

747
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,320
but no thanks.

748
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,800
You'd better stay put

749
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,840
until I take you where you belong.

750
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,120
No matter what,

751
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,160
you and your brother did come to Dengzhou because of me.

752
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,480
I'm responsible

753
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,130
for Zeng Xin's disappearance.

754
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,100
So I'll definitely help you find him.

755
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,680
I may not know martial arts,

756
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,880
but I'm quite clever.

757
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,120
I can help you come up with some ideas.

758
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,600
After I help you find Zeng Xin,

759
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,360
you can send me to jail then.

760
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,600
Of course,

761
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,520
I have my own agenda too.

762
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,040
During this time,

763
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,850
I want to find my father's real killer.

764
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,240
Your father

765
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,960
was indeed murdered.

766
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,680
Beheaded.

767
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,720
It was killed by a strange man in iron armor.

768
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,000
So you came looking for Xie Jingtang

769
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,560
to ask him about that armored man as well.

770
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,570
Seems like you encountered that armored man last night too.

771
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,200
But Xie Jingtang wasn't there at that time.

772
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,960
How did he know

773
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,560
that the armored man could pierce through people's chests from a distance?

774
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,120
What's his relationship with the armored man?

775
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,520
I was just about to find him to ask about this,

776
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,480
but it seems

777
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,120
someone got to him first and took him away.

778
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,320
You suspect

779
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,080
that the armored monster is connected to your brother's disappearance?

780
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,880
I don't know.

781
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,420
I just don't have any leads right now.

782
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,360
Over a hundred people in Dengzhou City mysteriously vanished almost at the same time.

783
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
It's too strange.

784
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,000
I can't help but think about that armored man.

785
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Grotesque in appearance

786
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,200
with strange powers.

787
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,930
And his timing of appearance is quite coincidental.

788
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,620
Between these two things,

789
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,780
there must be a close connection.

790
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,280
Boss

791
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,370
you're back.

792
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,240
You don't look so good.

793
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,460
Don't even mention it.

794
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,760
Would you like me to heat up some water

795
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,090
to make you feel better?

796
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,400
Sure thing.

797
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,640
Daozi.

798
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,800
Don't make the water too hot.

799
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,560
Got it.

800
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,290
I've had enough heat for today.

801
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,890
Here we go again.

802
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,640
It's absolutely true.

803
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,760
Everything I know comes from the beggar boy's drawing.

804
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,960
Where is that drawing?

805
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,890
Take us to see it.

806
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,800
Don't be ridiculous.

807
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,360
I just came back from there.

808
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,000
If the commander of the Qianji Guard hadn't told me,

809
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,680
I wouldn't have known the carpenter was killed by the iron-armored man.

810
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,480
You see?

811
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,640
Nothing to discover, right?

812
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,600
I told you there was no need to come.

813
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,800
We've been searching for so long

814
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,120
and haven't found any clues.

815
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,080
This line looks so out of place.

816
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,880
Why did he draw this separately?

817
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,480
Did he just make a random stroke because he hadn't thought it through?

818
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,040
No.

819
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,400
Something must have been leaning here before.

820
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,680
Look at this mark.

821
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,760
I remember now.

822
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,920
That broken door was leaning there at the time.

823
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,480
I was so scared then

824
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,410
and accidentally knocked it over.

825
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,690
Look at these undulating lines

826
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,760
Don't they look like battlements on a city wall?

827
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,560
So what?

828
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,160
It might represent a city.

829
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,880
A mirage.

830
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,160
This arrow indicates direction.

831
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,600
Although the little beggar didn't draw what the killer looked like,

832
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,880
he drew where

833
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,610
the killer was heading.

834
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,320
No wonder he kept looking up at something.

835
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,160
The armored stranger

836
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,520
is in the city within that mirage.

837
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,680
Childish.

838
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,840
Mirages aren't real.

839
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,280
How could a city float in the air?

840
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,820
Could all those missing people be there?

841
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,720
Hey.

842
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,520
You all believe this?

843
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,000
Fine.

844
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,360
Even if that city is real,

845
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,080
and the armored stranger is there,

846
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,140
and the missing people are there too,

847
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,720
the mirage has disappeared now.

848
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,520
Where are we supposed to find it?

849
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,040
Come with me.

850
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,690
Do you know where the mirage is?

851
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:47,880
You can't do this.

852
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,610
You can't burn bridges after crossing the river.

853
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,880
You need to find someone,

854
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,600
I need to find someone too.

855
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,930
We're in this together.

856
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,000
I admit I'm not good at martial arts,

857
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,680
but in Dengzhou,

858
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,480
there are things you can't accomplish without me.

859
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,060
Can you prepare a few fast horses?

860
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,080
Come out.

861
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,240
You knew to take shortcuts to follow us

862
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,960
and even detected our ambush from the hoofprints.

863
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,520
Seems you're not just a bread seller.

864
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,800
You're not just out for a leisure trip either, are you?

865
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,200
There must be some clues.

866
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,960
He's here looking for his daughter.

867
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,940
Let's go together.

868
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,760
That won't do.

869
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,200
Not everyone can just...

870
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,840
It's fine.

871
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,080
Judging by your skills just now,

872
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,610
you shouldn't slow us down.

873
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,480
Let's go together.

874
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,880
Why the different treatment?

875
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,540
You weren't like this with me.

876
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,380
Where are we going?

877
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,200
