1
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,840
I don't care who you are.

2
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm telling you.

3
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,250
If you offend the Gu family,

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,660
you will definitely come to a bad end.

5
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,120
How did you get this?

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,440
Your family's account book is incredibly detailed.

7
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,240
From court officials at the top,

8
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,360
to servants and doormen at the bottom.

9
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,820
You even have records from over 20 years ago.

10
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,080
So many people,

11
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,920
so many years.

12
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,960
The Gu family certainly knows how to spend money.

13
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,220
No wonder the business is so successful.

14
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,360
What exactly do you want?

15
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,220
I want justice.

16
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,320
Get down!

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Pick up the knife.

18
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,560
Kill him.

19
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,760
Brother Xie,

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,720
I was wrong.

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,520
I was wrong.

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,880
Brother Xie.

23
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,079
Sir,

24
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,920
what are you doing at the Gu residence?

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,440
Saving someone.

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,280
Who are you saving?

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
Saving the young master.

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,240
Sir.

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,490
We're saving...

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,240
who were we saving again?

31
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Kill him.

32
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,520
Young master.

33
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,160
If you do this, there's no turning back.

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,900
There won't be any witnesses.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,320
I'll kill everyone here if necessary.

36
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,690
Brother Xie.

37
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
Useless.

38
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,120
From today on,

39
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,400
we'll stay out of each other's way.

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,530
Let's all forget what happened today.

41
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
How thick is your family's account book?

42
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,100
You haven't forgotten, have you?

43
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,360
We'll keep the rest for you.

44
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
If this thing gets lost,

45
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,250
there will be serious trouble.

46
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,160
Those people in the capital have plenty of ways to protect themselves.

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,160
But your Gu family has caused them so much trouble.

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,440
I'm afraid...

49
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,560
Father, my ears.

50
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Hurry!

51
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,320
Quick!

52
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,520
Get him to the doctor!

53
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,320
Young master!

54
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,000
Why didn't you come when I called you?

55
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,600
Mr. Geng,

56
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,560
you saw everything, right?

57
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,200
What did I see?

58
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,480
I didn't see anything.

59
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,880
Did any of you see anything?

60
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,360
No,

61
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,220
nothing at all.

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,080
How did I end up here?

63
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,880
Where is this place?

64
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,360
I was in the middle of making soup.

65
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,720
My poor memory.

66
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,920
That bastard.

67
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,640
Master,

68
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,600
let's just drop this matter.

69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,659
What else can we do?

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,560
They've got us by the throat.

71
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,600
Master.

72
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,720
Let go of me.

73
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
What trash

74
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,640
dares to come to my Gu family?

75
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,900
You harbinger of doom!

76
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,680
After ruining the Xie family,

77
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,000
you think you can ruin mine?

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
Get out!

79
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,760
Thank you.

80
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,000
We just want you to know

81
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,200
that you're not alone.

82
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
But that ledger,

83
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,840
where did you get it from?

84
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,800
We weren't refusing to help you before.

85
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,530
We truly didn't know what to do.

86
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,000
We needed to secretly detain the Crown Prince,

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,840
but worried the Gu family would make a scene.

88
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,200
Our hands were tied.

89
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440
Until I got that ledger.

90
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,520
You still haven't answered my question.

91
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,600
A ledger like that

92
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,440
isn't something easy to obtain.

93
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
Remember I mentioned someone called Gu Tingmei

94
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
who stole my family heirloom?

95
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
Can you help me get it back?

96
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
You already know who the thief is.

97
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Why don't you just take some people and demand it back?

98
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,960
The Gu family

99
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,290
has powerful connections in the capital.

100
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,160
Yunniang.

101
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,680
I've thought of a way to help Xie Jingtang,

102
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,940
but you need to sneak into the Gu mansion.

103
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,090
Alright.

104
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
It's all over now.

105
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,080
Don't think about it anymore.

106
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,740
The outcome is good after all.

107
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,340
Take some time to recover.

108
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,400
Thank you.

109
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,020
You already said that.

110
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,080
This one is

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,720
especially for you.

112
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,000
Gu Tingmei was right.

113
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
I'm just useless.

114
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,880
I knew you wouldn't be able to kill someone.

115
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,660
Taking a life isn't that easy.

116
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
On my way to the Gu residence,

117
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
I imagined killing him ten thousand times.

118
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,520
But I still

119
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
couldn't do it.

120
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,280
I don't know why.

121
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,840
I wish I could be more like you.

122
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,960
Then I could handle

123
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,620
my own problems in the future.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,480
If you were like me,

125
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,050
you wouldn't have a future.

126
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Besides,

127
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,880
you could never become someone like me.

128
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,360
Do you know how I got this scar?

129
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,540
Twenty years ago, there was a severe drought in the Northwest.

130
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,720
For three consecutive years, there was almost no rain.

131
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,080
The fields dried up.

132
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,340
Even weeds couldn't survive.

133
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,560
Masses of refugees fled south.

134
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
My family was among them.

135
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,050
I was six years old then.

136
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,400
Besides my parents,

137
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,060
I also had two older brothers with me.

138
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
The journey was long and difficult.

139
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
Many people starved to death along the way.

140
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,480
But back then, the dead weren't buried.

141
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,360
After they ran out of dead bodies to eat,

142
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,960
they started eating the living.

143
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,100
Exchanging children for food

144
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,200
was a common practice.

145
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,960
To keep my two brothers alive,

146
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,760
my parents exchanged me with another family's child.

147
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
That day,

148
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,800
I was tied up by that family

149
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,240
and hung upside down from a tree.

150
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,720
That was the first time in my life

151
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,920
I spent so long

152
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,720
looking at this upside-down world.

153
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,360
That family's parents knelt on the ground.

154
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,320
Muttering something to the sky.

155
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,780
I don't know if they're thanking heaven for providing them a meal.

156
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,760
Or mourning their own children

157
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,760
on another tree.

158
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,120
That woman placed a basin under my head.

159
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,120
The man came with a knife.

160
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
I stared at that knife.

161
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,970
But I wasn't thinking about death.

162
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,570
Instead, I thought the knife was dull.

163
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,960
It would hurt terribly when it cuts.

164
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,500
I knew screaming was useless,

165
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,650
so I could only close my eyes

166
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,890
and clench my teeth.

167
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,160
I hoped death would come quickly.

168
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,520
When the knife cut into my neck,

169
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,400
I could feel the blood flowing down.

170
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
At that moment,

171
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,320
I suddenly heard a voice.

172
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,160
Then,

173
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,500
the knife stopped.

174
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,640
I opened my eyes

175
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,720
and saw a man in fine clothes.

176
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
He was standing right where he blocked the sunlight,

177
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,420
his face was in shadow,

178
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,440
I couldn't see what he looked like.

179
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,400
I just felt his whole being was glowing.

180
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,000
Then he gave that family a sheep.

181
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,240
Replace me.

182
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,240
This man is my master,

183
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,400
Cao Jiande.

184
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,600
Before leaving,

185
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,200
I saw that family slaughtering a sheep.

186
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,480
It turned out

187
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,120
I was just a sheep too.

188
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,800
Later, my master sent me to a mountain estate.

189
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,010
There were several masters at the estate.

190
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,640
They taught me to read and write

191
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,370
and trained me in martial arts.

192
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,860
The masters were all very strict.

193
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,240
Being beaten and disciplined was my daily routine.

194
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,760
But I never minded.

195
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,560
Because I knew

196
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,320
I was no longer a sheep.

197
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,040
I stayed at that estate for eight years.

198
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
When I was 14,

199
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
my master sent me down the mountain.

200
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,420
He gave me a book with pictures

201
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,600
and told me to kill everyone in it.

202
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,040
I asked him why.

203
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,680
He said,

204
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,880
'Whatever I order you to do,

205
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,440
never ask why.'

206
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,720
After I killed all 15 people,

207
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,660
I found out they were a gang of mountain bandits.

208
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
From then on,

209
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
I worked for him

210
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,080
and never asked why again.

211
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,800
Because I know

212
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,920
he must have had his reasons.

213
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,980
So you've been desperately seeking revenge for him

214
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,250
because he saved your life.

215
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,810
He was your benefactor.

216
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,960
All these years,

217
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,500
I've done many things for him.

218
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,040
Some were tedious,

219
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,849
some were ruthless and cold-blooded.

220
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,170
I've always lived according to his plans.

221
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,160
Living that way,

222
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,040
I had a purpose.

223
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,839
But now he's dead.

224
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Besides revenge,

225
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,720
I don't know what else I can do.

226
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
So that's why you said

227
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,800
someone like you

228
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,400
has no future.

229
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,980
Only the path forward,

230
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,480
nothing behind.

231
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,960
You claim you have no choice,

232
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,160
but deep down you know

233
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
you've always been living for someone else.

234
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,330
You were tied down by someone else.

235
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,440
But that person is dead now.

236
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,720
That rope is broken.

237
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,260
You need to be yourself again.

238
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,800
You...

239
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,640
there are still many things you can do.

240
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,160
There are so many fun things in this world,

241
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
beautiful things, delicious food.

242
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,200
Aren't they all better than throwing your life away?

243
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Stay alive and do something meaningful.

244
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,600
Wouldn't that be better?

245
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,320
What is meaningful?

246
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,250
When you put it that way,

247
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,280
I really don't know.

248
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,600
But

249
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,770
we'll find something eventually.

250
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,200
So...

251
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,450
Let's search together.

252
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,160
See who finds it first.

253
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,240
Yunniang.

254
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,020
I've noticed you have a bad habit.

255
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,210
Why do you always eavesdrop on others?

256
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,760
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
What did they say?

258
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,170
Got caught, didn't you?

259
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,360
This is what my master used to buy the Xie family heirloom.

260
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,640
Since that item is now in the Iron Armor Man's possession,

261
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,100
there's no need for me to keep this bank note.

262
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,770
I'm returning it to you now.

263
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,290
Cao Sheng

264
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,850
When are we going to kidnap the prince?

265
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,920
Shouldn't you be happy to see me so eager?

266
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,720
You're ready to go now,

267
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,040
but Feng Buhai can't go anymore.

268
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:50,960
Sir,

269
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,620
your water.

270
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,600
Thank you.

271
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,320
Mother.

272
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,220
Time to wash your feet.

273
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,000
Tongtong,

274
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,800
let me do it.

275
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,860
You go to bed first.

276
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,360
Come, Mother.

277
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,480
Guanying,

278
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,090
do you have something on your mind?

279
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,960
No.

280
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
How's the roof repair coming along?

281
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Almost finished.

282
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
I never expected this.

283
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,840
What is it, Mother?

284
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,760
In the past,

285
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,240
you were always a loner.

286
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,640
Except for Xiaobao, you had no friends.

287
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
I used to worry,

288
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,320
if I were gone,

289
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,980
and Tongtong grew up and got married,

290
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,280
you'd be all alone.

291
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,720
But now,

292
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,640
I see you have many friends around you.

293
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,920
Mother,

294
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,720
you don't need to worry anymore.

295
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,000
Although Zeng Qian might be sleeping downstairs,

296
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,840
doing this

297
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,120
isn't it a bit too obvious?

298
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
I can help you,

299
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,080
but some things

300
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,400
need to be made clear.

301
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,290
I thought you were already asleep.

302
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,760
I can't sleep.

303
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,920
Why did you come down?

304
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,680
I heard drinking alone makes your shoulders heavier,

305
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,920
but drinking together makes it better.

306
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Isn't your shoulder heavy because you drank too much?

307
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,850
Just say it if you want to drink.

308
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Is there any left?

309
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,050
Seems like there isn't.

310
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,240
You didn't come down just to drink, did you?

311
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,740
Do you know what's been

312
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,850
the most comforting thing I've heard these days?

313
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,720
It's when you said that no matter how anxious you are,

314
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,580
you won't lose your rationality.

315
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,440
Now I need to tell you something,

316
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
and I hope you can stay rational too.

317
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,160
I'll try.

318
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
You're bleeding.

319
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,960
The wound on Feng Buhai's arm

320
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,740
was burned afterward.

321
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,960
Actually, at first

322
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,160
it was an arrow wound.

323
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,960
So he really is Ye Xie.

324
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,200
After all you've said,

325
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,840
I honestly don't care

326
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,240
whether you're Feng Buhai or Liu Guanying.

327
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,760
I just want to know

328
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,200
why you killed my father.

329
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,500
I didn't kill your father.

330
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,720
Before I joined Tabai City,

331
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,800
I worked at the Zouwu Institute.

332
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,360
One day I received a mission

333
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,320
to protect a hunter at Jiuyuan Mountain.

334
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,560
Missions from the Zouwu Institute are usually conducted in secret,

335
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,080
so I wore black clothes that day

336
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,210
and covered my face.

337
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,760
When I arrived at the mountain, I saw the hunter,

338
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,280
your father,

339
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,240
surrounded by another group of people in black,

340
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,300
severely wounded.

341
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,800
And you

342
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,960
had fainted nearby.

343
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,010
I was still too late.

344
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,690
I killed several of the attackers,

345
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,560
but two of them escaped.

346
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,570
I saw your father lying on the ground, unable to breathe.

347
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Based on my experience,

348
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,800
his airway was blocked by blood clots.

349
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,840
So

350
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,160
I used my knife to open his airway

351
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,440
so he could breathe.

352
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That's when you woke up

353
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,760
and saw what was happening.

354
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,770
Then I went after the two escapees.

355
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,340
But I couldn't catch them.

356
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,680
When I returned,

357
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,760
you and your father were gone.

358
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,880
I rushed to your home

359
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,120
and found it empty.

360
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,560
That's because I woke up in time

361
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,480
and found my father was still alive.

362
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,960
So I took him back home,

363
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,370
but I was worried those men in black would return,

364
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,120
so I had to leave with my father and Axin.

365
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,080
Actually, that day when you ambushed me on the roof,

366
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,480
I already recognized you

367
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,720
as the hunter's daughter.

368
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
If you were innocent,

369
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,320
and knew I came for revenge,

370
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,380
why didn't you explain everything earlier?

371
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,560
I was desperate to find Lin Han

372
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,320
and had no time for explanations.

373
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Later, when Tongtong went missing,

374
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,080
I still needed to work with you all.

375
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,740
If I had rashly told the truth,

376
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
you might not have believed me

377
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,490
and it would only complicate matters.

378
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,040
A few days ago, someone died suddenly in the back courtyard.

379
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,240
Feng Buhai brought Tongtong here

380
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,300
specifically to tell you about this.

381
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,000
But then the prince and others suddenly appeared,

382
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,530
and the plan was disrupted.

383
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,700
How can you prove you're not with those men in black?

384
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,720
I have every reason to think you're lying.

385
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,050
If I had wanted to kill your father,

386
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,800
do you think

387
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,530
he would still be alive?

388
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,100
My father didn't survive.

389
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,610
One day later...

390
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,180
He passed away.

391
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,720
That's because his injuries were too severe.

392
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,850
Over a dozen wounds.

393
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,160
It was beyond saving.

394
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,930
If it weren't for my intervention,

395
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,740
he would have died on the spot.

396
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,360
Who exactly ordered you to protect us?

397
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,320
The head of Zouwu Agency.

398
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,280
Who is the head?

399
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,890
I don't know.

400
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,160
The documents Cao Sheng retrieved from the Crown Prince

401
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,820
were left by the Zouwu Agency.

402
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,600
They bear that person's private seal.

403
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,640
The agency's missions are usually issued through this private seal.

404
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,040
No one knows who he is.

405
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,520
Now that the Zouwu Agency has been disbanded,

406
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,840
finding this person

407
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,160
will be even more difficult.

408
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,840
As for why he ordered me to protect you,

409
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
to be honest,

410
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,940
I'm quite curious myself.

411
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,040
The only explanation is

412
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,180
you're not ordinary hunters.

413
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,250
There are so many hunters in those mountains.

414
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Maybe they've got the wrong person.

415
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,330
About you puncturing someone's airway to save them,

416
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,840
I'll believe you for now.

417
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,490
It seems the grudge between you two

418
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,640
is truly just a thing of the past.

419
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,960
But now,

420
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,520
I need to tell you two things

421
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,160
that I hope will also become

422
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,400
a thing of the past for you.

423
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,800
Since you've already put it that way,

424
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,640
it seems

425
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,720
it's likely to be a grudge.

426
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,680
Whether it's a grudge

427
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,610
or just history,

428
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
I'll be honest.

429
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,140
But you both...

430
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,170
He's doing this on purpose.

431
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I think so too.

432
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,720
I'll keep my eye on him right here.

433
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,040
I want to see

434
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,770
how long he can keep up this act.

435
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,120
I'm sorry,

436
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,360
I fell asleep again.

437
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,400
How long was I out?

438
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
It'll be dawn in half an hour.

439
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,810
Almost three hours.

440
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,400
Daozi came and replaced all the candles.

441
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,960
Is the atmosphere still right for us to continue talking?

442
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,760
Why don't you go back to your room and get some rest?

443
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,880
It's fine.

444
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,840
Go ahead.

445
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,200
I'm sleep-deprived.

446
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,160
I couldn't tell.

447
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,100
Your nose is bleeding.

448
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Just overheated.

449
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,360
It's nothing.

450
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,440
Come on.

451
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,290
Tell me about your past.

452
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,360
No.

453
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,000
Your grudges.

454
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,160
Alright.

455
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,200
I told you before.

456
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
I deliberately let you catch me

457
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,520
to use your position as an assassin

458
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,160
to restrain the Qianji Guards watching my father.

459
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,480
That's true,

460
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,920
but not the whole story.

461
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,160
Actually, your encounter with Ye Xiao

462
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,480
was also my doing.

463
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,160
Let me clarify something first.

464
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,760
I really had no idea back then

465
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,620
that we would become friends now.

466
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,320
Since I became a fugitive,

467
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,159
many bounty hunters have chased me,

468
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,400
but you're the only one who's been relentlessly on my tail.

469
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,460
This makes me very curious about you.

470
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,560
So I had someone look into your background

471
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,000
and discovered you've been searching for someone with a broken left eyebrow

472
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,130
and exceptional martial arts skills.

473
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,320
Judging from how you've been asking about him,

474
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,880
he can't possibly be your friend.

475
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,199
He must be your enemy.

476
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,409
As it happens, I know where this person is.

477
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,600
Before this, I learned that

478
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,929
my father was being escorted to Dengzhou.

479
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,280
I came to Dengzhou early to make preparations

480
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,120
and found that the wanted criminal 'Night Demon'

481
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,840
has a broken left eyebrow and exceptional martial skills.

482
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,639
I suspect he's the person you've been looking for.

483
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,050
So I deliberately lured you near Dengzhou

484
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,340
and let you capture me.

485
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,650
This way you would stay in Dengzhou

486
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,000
and see Ye Yao on the wanted poster,

487
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,260
the very person you've been looking for.

488
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,920
I also happened to know

489
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,000
that Ye Yao had a grudge with Lin Han, the leader of Qianji Guard.

490
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,680
So I deliberately spread the news

491
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,280
that Lin Han was coming to Dengzhou.

492
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,880
So Ye Yao would learn about it 'accidentally.'

493
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,900
Then Ye Yao would go after Lin Han.

494
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,680
And to prevent Ye Yao from falling into someone else's hands

495
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,920
and losing your chance for revenge,

496
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
you would certainly step in to help.

497
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,760
This created the perfect situation to use both of you

498
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,720
to keep the Qianji Guard in check.

499
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,480
How did you find out about me and Lin Han?

500
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,400
Since I learned that Zeng Qian was looking for Ye Miao,

501
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,930
I began investigating him.

502
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,170
At first, I had no leads.

503
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,240
Until I analyzed his methods

504
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,520
and deduced he had military training.

505
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,480
That narrowed down the possibilities considerably.

506
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,320
My father previously served in the Ministry of War.

507
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,180
I used his connections to access military records.

508
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,520
I found someone with a broken left eyebrow

509
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,600
named Feng Buhai.

510
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,880
He previously served in Baili Yuan's Divine Machine Battalion.

511
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,520
After the Battle of Wusuling.

512
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,250
I was transferred to Tabai City

513
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
and then followed Baili Yuan to Huo River to hunt down the remaining troops.

514
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,480
After the Battle of Huo River,

515
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,640
Feng Buhai reported his comrade Lin Han to his superiors,

516
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,840
accusing him of killing their comrade Liu Guanying.

517
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,160
The investigation into Liu Guanying's death led nowhere,

518
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,560
and Feng Buhai subsequently disappeared.

519
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,080
Now it seems

520
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,480
my father intervened

521
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,770
because he didn't want Lin Han's identity to be exposed.

522
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,200
I searched all over Dengzhou

523
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,600
but couldn't find anyone named Feng Buhai.

524
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,200
However, I found someone called Liu Guanying

525
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,400
who makes a living selling vegetable buns.

526
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,130
He also returned from Tabai after retiring from military service.

527
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,290
But wasn't Liu Guanying already dead?

528
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Then there's only one possibility.

529
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
This Liu Guanying

530
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,840
is you,

531
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,320
Feng Buhai,

532
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,400
also known as Ye Xiao.

533
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,840
About me being Ye Xiao,

534
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
I always thought you and Yun Niang

535
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,240
discovered it when you were investigating me

536
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,400
and sneaked into my house

537
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,920
finding my disguise.

538
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,800
So it seems

539
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,960
you've known all along.

540
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
I'm confessing all this to everyone

541
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
because first,

542
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,760
I feel guilty for using you all.

543
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,600
Second, we're now facing a common enemy.

544
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,920
We need to unite and be honest with each other,

545
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,280
with no more secrets.

546
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,320
Of course,

547
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,680
I understand how you feel.

548
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,360
If you can't forgive me,

549
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,280
even if you draw your swords against me,

550
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,800
I'll accept it.

551
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,280
Whether I forgive you

552
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,930
depends on your sincerity.

553
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,520
When I was in the Divine Machine Battalion,

554
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,720
there were ten prohibitions.

555
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Breaking one meant losing a finger.

556
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,120
One of them was

557
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,680
no deceiving others.

558
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,480
Zeng Qian,

559
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,490
may I borrow your knife?

560
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,840
If he hadn't acted in time

561
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,970
That finger of yours is ruined now.

562
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,650
I'll accept the consequences.

563
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,920
Are you done with this drama?

564
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,000
How about another drink?

565
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,720
Feng Buhai,

566
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
so this is what you really look like.

567
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,400
I think he looked better with some scars on his face.

568
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,810
Would you like a few cuts yourself?

569
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,360
Please.

570
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,040
Wait.

571
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,600
I think I have one more confession to make.

572
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,860
You seem to have quite a lot of past deeds.

573
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,920
Young Master Xie,

574
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,650
the person who hijacked your carriage

575
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,000
was me.

576
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
That's not right.

577
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,960
What's going on here?

578
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,240
Zeng Qian,

579
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,920
may I borrow your knife?

580
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,920
Just kidding.

581
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,840
Actually, I've known all along.

582
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,160
I may be slow, but I'm not stupid.

583
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,820
I just wanted to see when you'd tell me yourself.

584
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,120
Let's do this.

585
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,720
Drink three cups as your penalty first.

586
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,650
I'll go to the kitchen and get you some roast chicken.

587
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Start eating.

588
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,760
Is it possible that he actually doesn't know

589
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,440
and is just saying this

590
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,480
to save face?

591
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,160
Here we go.

592
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Soy sauce-flavored roast chicken.

593
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,580
And I've prepared something special

594
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,170
just for you.

595
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,200
Try it.

596
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,720
Please.

597
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,760
Go ahead.

598
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,400
Please do.

599
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,360
Although I'm still injured,

600
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,520
if you need my help.

601
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,680
I do need your help,

602
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,640
but you don't have to go into the mountains.

603
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,920
It's something else.

604
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,280
If I haven't returned by morning,

605
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,640
give this letter to Mrs. Ji

606
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,900
and take her and Tongtong away from Dengzhou immediately.

607
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,250
I wonder if Mrs. Ji still remembers me.

608
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,040
Ever since

609
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,200
she tried to set me up with Erya from the village,

610
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,660
I've never stepped foot in your house again.

611
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,840
Don't worry,

612
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,900
she won't forget that smell of yours.

613
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,600
Listen, with that broken eyebrow of yours,

614
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,240
The county magistrate may be gone,

615
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,240
but there are still many assassins staying at the inn.

616
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,440
You're too conspicuous like this.

617
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,040
They've spent quite a bit of money

618
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,500
trying to get information about you from me.

619
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,570
I'm afraid I might not resist selling you out.

620
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,040
You should cover it up.

621
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,060
Let's talk when I return from the mountains.

622
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,160
Does it need to be this long, sir?

623
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,220
We need to kidnap the prince tonight.

624
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,570
The needle is too short.

625
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,020
I'm afraid we won't have enough time.

626
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,940
Then wait until tonight to inject it.

627
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,240
We can't have any mistakes during the day either.

628
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,640
Can't be like last night.

629
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,400
Last night you also

630
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,080
slept for six hours.

631
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,050
If you use such a long needle this time,

632
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,960
then next time won't you...

633
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,420
The arrow is on the string.

634
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,200
Don't worry about it.

635
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,520
What?

636
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,600
We need the element of surprise.

637
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,760
No, no.

638
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,640
I'm just afraid

639
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,800
this needle is too long

640
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,600
and it will take time to inject.

641
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,160
It will be very painful.

642
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,160
Bear with it a little, young master.

643
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,450
You wanted to see me?

644
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,740
Have a seat, Tongtong.

645
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,320
Tongtong,

646
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,280
do you prefer the mountains or the seaside?

647
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,280
The seaside,

648
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,900
I've never been there.

649
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,980
What's this about?

650
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,010
I happen to have several houses there.

651
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,000
Tongtong,

652
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,680
I...

653
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,380
I need to go out for some business.

654
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,800
If I don't come back,

655
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,560
Uncle Bao will come for you and Grandma.

656
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,780
Go with him when that happens.

657
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
What do you mean you won't come back?

658
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,520
It means

659
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,180
we'll meet again somewhere else.
