1
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,100
You went too hard just now.

2
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,520
Of course I did.

3
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,610
I'm not complimenting you.

4
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,720
I was afraid to tell you,

5
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,380
worried you'd risk your life.

6
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,600
You're already injured,

7
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,200
and now this.

8
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm fine.

9
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,880
So the Armored Man is just like your master Cao Jiande,

10
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,740
both wanting my family heirloom.

11
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,680
My father also knew about his family heirloom.

12
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,010
My master just secretly

13
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,520
asked me to post a reward to find this thing.

14
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,240
He didn't tell me anything else.

15
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,160
He told me

16
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,200
to verify if it's authentic,

17
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,320
the most direct way is to try to damage it.

18
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,579
If it remains completely undamaged,

19
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,680
then it's the real thing.

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,940
So our family heirloom is impenetrable.

21
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,530
That's why you asked me to bring a hammer to the exchange.

22
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
How's your wound?

23
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,960
Are you okay?

24
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,600
It's nothing.

25
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,560
Just a scratch.

26
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,880
Young Master,

27
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,480
it's time to remove the needles.

28
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,250
It hurts so much!

29
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,960
I told you to give me some time.

30
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,220
Let me prepare myself.

31
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,800
I won't do this again next time.

32
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,660
You said the same thing last time.

33
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,210
Are you alright?

34
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Why did you come back?

35
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
You've been busy lately.

36
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,650
Even though you kept it from me,

37
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
I know something's wrong.

38
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,960
If there's trouble, I can help.

39
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,760
Help?

40
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,380
Do you know you almost made things worse?

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Your father is already dead.

42
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,760
Now you're all Grandma has left.

43
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,960
My father isn't dead.

44
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,560
At least that's what Grandma believes.

45
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,220
And you can't be in danger either.

46
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,840
Please take Tongtong back home.

47
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,490
Let's go.

48
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
Oh, Tongtong.

49
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,200
Tell Grandma

50
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,400
the roof isn't fixed yet.

51
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,520
I'll be back later.

52
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,320
You're fixing more than just the roof, aren't you?

53
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,200
It's obvious.

54
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,460
That armored man wasn't after Tongtong.

55
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
His target

56
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,810
was my family heirloom.

57
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,840
That thing has been in my home for so many years.

58
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,780
If my father hadn't told me it was a family heirloom,

59
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,240
I really don't see anything special about it.

60
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,920
Now it's suddenly become a hot commodity.

61
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,720
So many people fighting over it.

62
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,360
I thought not many people knew about my family heirloom.

63
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,220
But now it seems

64
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,600
quite a lot of people know about it.

65
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,480
And they seem to

66
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,450
know more about it than I do.

67
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,680
The Iron Man didn't use invisibility this time.

68
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
My heirloom didn't light up either.

69
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,320
Does it only light up when he's invisible?

70
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,180
And stays dark when he's visible?

71
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
There's another possibility.

72
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,330
That light might have nothing to do with the Iron Man.

73
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,680
But that time Feng clearly saw him,

74
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
and the heirloom was glowing.

75
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,159
There's something else strange though.

76
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,560
Today when you were protecting Tongtong,

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,840
the Iron Man's blade was right at your back

78
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,120
but suddenly stopped.

79
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,880
Was it

80
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,090
that a father protecting his daughter moved him?

81
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,440
Maybe

82
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,300
he has children of his own.

83
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,840
What's wrong?

84
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,840
Can't bad guys have children too?

85
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,640
How are you sure he's even human?

86
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,000
Right.

87
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,760
He has a tail,

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,880
and it's quite long too.

89
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,280
We call him Iron Man

90
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,340
because his shape resembles a human.

91
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
But what's hidden inside his armor,

92
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,440
none of us knows.

93
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,170
What's wrapped inside,

94
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,520
could it be some kind of monster?

95
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,280
Anyway,

96
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,480
let's retreat first.

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I'll go back and treat their wounds.

98
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,400
Especially Lin Han.

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,640
I just got her almost healed,

100
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
and now

101
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,760
she's got new wounds on top of old ones.

102
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,290
Let's go.

103
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,020
Aren't you coming?

104
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,320
You all go back first.

105
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,380
I need to rest a bit.

106
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,240
I don't feel like moving either.

107
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,860
Then I'll go ahead.

108
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,770
Be careful, you two.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,040
You should explain the Iron Man situation to Zeng Qian.

110
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,080
If she really forces her way into Wuji Temple

111
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
and encounters the Iron Man,

112
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
she might never return.

113
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,440
It's extremely dangerous.

114
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,240
Young Master,

115
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,040
Zeng Qian is missing.

116
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,760
When did this happen?

117
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
I just went to deliver something to her

118
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,120
but found her room empty.

119
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,160
What's wrong? Why the rush?

120
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,080
Zeng Qian might have gone to Wuji Temple to find Zeng Xin.

121
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,280
Isn't that suicide?

122
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,240
Yunniang, prepare the horses.

123
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,770
Alright.

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,320
You'll be dead too if you go.

125
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,580
Then what should we do?

126
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,180
Well...

127
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,540
Let's go together.

128
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,880
I'll take back our family heirloom too.

129
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,000
What's wrong?

130
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,170
Where have you been?

131
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,860
I was resting in the backyard.

132
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,400
You thought I went to Wuji Temple?

133
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,330
Don't worry.

134
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,820
Although I'm anxious,

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,460
I haven't lost my mind yet.

136
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,970
I must say, you're so disloyal.

137
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,640
We were about to storm Wuji Temple,

138
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,100
and you didn't even budge.

139
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,720
Her bow and arrows are still in the room.

140
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,180
Come in and sit for a while.

141
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,400
This door of mine really needs fixing.

142
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,450
Get some rest early.

143
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,160
Young Master,

144
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,600
didn't you notice her bow just now?

145
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,800
Anyway,

146
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,970
whether she's that little girl from back then or not,

147
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,920
you clearly care about her.

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,520
But don't worry.

149
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
I feel that

150
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,000
she's quite sensible.

151
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
That's now.

152
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,960
The future is uncertain.

153
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,840
What else can we do?

154
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,120
That's the Emperor we're talking about.

155
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,960
Besides, he has that iron-armored monster.

156
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,560
No, wait.

157
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,360
It might not even be human.

158
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
Mr. Ma,

159
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,760
eat up.

160
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,640
Look at all these dishes you ordered so early in the morning.

161
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,370
Drinking already at this hour?

162
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,640
My bad.

163
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,460
Come on, Mr. Ma,

164
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,800
have you heard?

165
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,970
The Crown Prince

166
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,180
is in Dengzhou.

167
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,840
Not just the Crown Prince in Dengzhou.

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,640
The Emperor and the Prince of Jingnan are there too.

169
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,400
It seems

170
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
something big is about to happen.

171
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,920
Ma Jindao,

172
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,610
what are you talking about?

173
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,640
Is it about the Emperor being in Dengzhou?

174
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,600
Look at you,

175
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,880
still keeping secrets.

176
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,760
Just look outside.

177
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,960
Everyone in the streets knows about it.

178
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,360
We didn't spread this news.

179
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
How did they find out?

180
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,600
Do you ministers know

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,980
about the Prince of Jingnan coming to Dengzhou?

182
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,160
I've only heard rumors in town,

183
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,040
and have sent someone to verify.

184
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,280
The Emperor ordered the Prince of Jingnan to guard the border.

185
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,880
Why would he suddenly appear here?

186
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,650
Shouldn't you ask the Ministry of War about that?

187
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,040
If the Prince of Jingnan is in Dengzhou,

188
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,780
and the Emperor plans to stay here for several days,

189
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,160
should we summon troops from nearby?

190
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,280
In case he has ill intentions.

191
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
I believe

192
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,280
before we clarify the King of Jingnan's intentions,

193
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
we shouldn't be overly suspicious.

194
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,480
Report!

195
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,360
Your Majesty,

196
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,690
the King of Jingnan requests an audience.

197
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,000
Let him in.

198
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,970
Yes, sir.

199
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,040
Long live the Emperor!

200
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,810
I congratulate Father on your rejuvenation.

201
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,170
You may rise.

202
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,620
Thank you, Father.

203
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,560
I didn't have much time left.

204
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,080
I never thought I'd have a chance to be reborn.

205
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,080
It's truly a blessing from heaven.

206
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,210
Compared to before,

207
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,200
I now feel full of energy,

208
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,460
like a young man again.

209
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,680
This former body of mine

210
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,800
is of no use anymore.

211
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
I will arrange for the imperial guards today

212
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,520
to escort Your Majesty's body back to the capital.

213
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,090
What royal body?

214
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
It's merely an empty shell.

215
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,880
This legendary art of rejuvenation

216
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,840
sought by countless emperors throughout history

217
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,880
has been obtained by Father Emperor.

218
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,920
This is a great blessing for the empire

219
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,850
and good fortune for all subjects.

220
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,760
That I can witness this miracle with my own eyes

221
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,290
is truly my greatest honor.

222
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,640
Thirteen.

223
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,080
Shouldn't you be stationed at the northern frontier now?

224
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,880
Father Emperor came to Dengzhou in secret

225
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,840
with only a few trusted ministers

226
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,560
and several hundred imperial guards.

227
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,640
This place is only hundreds of miles from General Baili Yuan's residence.

228
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,840
I was concerned for Father Emperor's safety

229
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,970
and came specifically to protect you.

230
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
And how many men did you bring with you?

231
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,640
I came alone,

232
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,760
without a single soldier,

233
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,890
please see the truth, Father Emperor.

234
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,240
Brother Thirteen, though you're the bravest of our warriors,

235
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,700
with your strength alone,

236
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
how could you possibly protect him?

237
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,980
And how did the Crown Prince protect him?

238
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,080
I heard two rustic men broke into the Taoist temple two days ago

239
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,740
and abducted Father Emperor.

240
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,640
Enough.

241
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Brothers,

242
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,050
stop taking jabs at each other.

243
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,640
The entire city of Dengzhou now knows

244
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,770
that the three of us, father and sons, are gathered here.

245
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,520
But My rejuvenation

246
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,290
should still be kept quiet.

247
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,250
After We leave Dengzhou

248
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,760
and return to the capital,

249
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,560
We will announce it to the world.

250
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,440
The whole country will celebrate.

251
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,520
Father is wise.

252
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,000
Your Majesty is wise.

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,080
Long live the Emperor!

254
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,360
You're wasting my medicine.

255
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,760
How much?

256
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,880
It's not about money.

257
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,040
I just don't understand.

258
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,120
What spell did Cao Jiande cast on you?

259
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,440
Making you so blindly loyal.

260
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Even if he treated you extremely well,

261
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,100
even if you want to avenge him,

262
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,130
you still need to know your limits.

263
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,260
I heard from Yunniang before,

264
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
you buried yourself in sand for two days and nights

265
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,880
to assassinate a rebel leader.

266
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,280
At least that showed courage and strategy.

267
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,360
But now?

268
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,250
You only have courage left.

269
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,200
You clearly can't win but still fight so desperately.

270
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,859
Is that what you call revenge?

271
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,760
It's clearly seeking death.

272
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,720
Young Master.

273
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,280
What's the matter, Mr. Advisor? Why so urgent?

274
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,079
Young Master.

275
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,640
This...

276
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,040
I found this while sorting through the Master's belongings.

277
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,839
I think this is quite important.

278
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,560
This is the letter from the prefecture office.

279
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,400
It mainly reminds the Master

280
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
to be cautious with his affairs lately.

281
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
It also specifically mentions the Emperor,

282
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,500
and the Crown Prince and Prince of Jingnan's matters in Dengzhou.

283
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,920
Everyone in town knows about this now.

284
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,440
But I didn't leak it.

285
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,440
A court runner found this letter.

286
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,090
It passed through several hands before reaching me.

287
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
So Father knew about this all along.

288
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,560
No wonder he kept saying that day

289
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,400
that we've offended someone powerful.

290
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,280
And told us to send Zeng Xin back.

291
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,920
Do you know what kind of people

292
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,120
are in that Wuji Temple?

293
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,240
If we don't return the person,

294
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,000
we'll all be in grave danger.

295
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,920
Young Master.

296
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,500
I'll go first then.

297
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
If you need anything,

298
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,400
just call me.

299
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,400
Being sad won't help.

300
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,280
What else can I do?

301
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,280
I don't know.

302
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,480
I just wanted

303
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,840
to comfort you.

304
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,780
You're really bad at comforting people.

305
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,760
Indeed.

306
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,520
I miss my father.

307
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,800
I used to be so willful.

308
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,440
Acting recklessly.

309
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,160
All because

310
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,770
I felt that no matter what I did,

311
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
my father would always cover for me.

312
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,800
Although we argued all the time,

313
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,200
in my eyes,

314
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,880
he was always as reliable as a mountain.

315
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
But now,

316
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,480
that mountain

317
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,640
is gone.

318
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Thinking about these past 30 years,

319
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,370
I've only made trouble,

320
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,760
never did anything worthwhile.

321
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,440
I'm truly worthless.

322
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,800
Being worthless

323
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,200
is still better than having no control over your life.

324
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,240
I'm so useless.

325
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,530
Now I've lost the family heirloom too.

326
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,140
That was the only thing my father left me.

327
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,010
Where are you going?

328
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,440
Back to the county office.

329
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,720
To pack up my things.

330
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,450
That place is no longer my home.

331
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,600
What are you doing?

332
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,040
Hurry up and write the divorce papers.

333
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm going back to my parents' home tonight.

334
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
Let's part on good terms.

335
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,360
It's barely been seven days since my father's death.

336
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,040
If you leave now,

337
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,370
people will laugh at us.

338
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,560
Your father is dead.

339
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,080
This county office will change hands sooner or later.

340
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,810
Why should I stick around here?

341
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,740
Move aside.

342
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,360
Come back.

343
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,660
Let's have a drink.

344
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,360
Sure.

345
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,090
Let's go.

346
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,440
She's out.

347
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
What took so long?

348
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,090
I was packing my things.

349
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,280
Got everything?

350
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,320
Great.

351
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,480
Go back.

352
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,540
What are you doing?

353
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,170
Brother Xie.

354
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,040
I mean no harm.

355
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
I just want to escort your wife back to her family.

356
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,840
Rest assured.

357
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,820
I'll certainly persuade her to return soon.

358
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,920
What if she doesn't want to come back?

359
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,800
Then I'll reluctantly

360
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,000
take care of her for you.

361
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,860
About your father's passing,

362
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,960
my condolences.

363
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
We're practically brothers.

364
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,360
I'm almost like a son to Magistrate Xie.

365
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,580
I should pay my respects at his grave.

366
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,640
But taking care of your wife

367
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
will be my way of showing respect.

368
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,600
Gu Tingmei

369
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,680
Not accepting it, huh?

370
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,480
Xie Jingtang

371
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,160
I used to show you respect

372
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,920
because of your father.

373
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,060
You really think I can't beat you?

374
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,560
Your father is dead.

375
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,890
My father is the Deputy Magistrate

376
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
and now he's the Acting Magistrate.

377
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,520
Once the official document arrives,

378
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
he'll be the new County Magistrate.

379
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
Keep your tail between your legs

380
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,440
and get lost.

381
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,040
Next time we meet, I won't be so polite.

382
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,560
Lao Che, Dongzi, help me.

383
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,210
You don't really think we consider you a brother, do you?

384
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,040
You're always ordering people around.

385
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,700
Without your father, you're nothing but trash.

386
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,480
Look at you now, all alone

387
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,320
without a single friend.

388
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,600
By the way.

389
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,840
Do you know how those people from Wuji Temple

390
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,280
managed to find you?

391
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,080
When they were investigating Qianhuo Shop,

392
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,200
I was there.

393
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,080
I was the one who told them about what you did.

394
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Brother Xie.

395
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,440
Let me go.

396
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,480
Let go of me.

397
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,040
Release me.

398
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,280
Calm down.

399
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,160
Let me go.

400
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,880
Father Emperor sent for me

401
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,840
for what matter?

402
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,780
About your thirteenth brother coming to Dengzhou,

403
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
what do you think?

404
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,640
The Prince of Jingnan is concerned about Father Emperor's safety

405
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,240
and wishes to stay by his side

406
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,810
to fulfill his filial duty.

407
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,560
There are no outsiders here.

408
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,680
You don't need to hold back your words.

409
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,280
I do have a request.

410
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,120
In recent years,

411
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,840
the Prince of Jingnan has amassed military power

412
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,700
largely because the Emperor has been in poor health

413
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,800
and Baili Yuan controls his own territory,

414
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,060
requiring someone to maintain balance.

415
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,720
Now that the Emperor has successfully rejuvenated himself,

416
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,320
we can take this opportunity

417
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,560
to eliminate him.

418
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,780
What your thirteenth brother said that day -

419
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,040
don't you understand yet?

420
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,120
He said, 'I came to Dengzhou secretly,

421
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,800
bringing only a few important ministers

422
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,660
and some guards and attendants.'

423
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,960
What he implied was

424
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,690
that although I have rejuvenated myself,

425
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,000
it hasn't been announced to the world yet.

426
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,460
Those who recognize this body as the Emperor

427
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,490
are only these people present.

428
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,520
If we rashly eliminate him,

429
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,200
his subordinates

430
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,240
might not recognize me as Emperor

431
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,360
and could rebel.

432
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,280
The matter of eliminating the Prince of Jingnan

433
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
can be unrelated to Father Emperor.

434
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I will take the initiative on my own.

435
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,050
When the time comes, to appease public anger,

436
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,600
Father can simply strip me of my Crown Prince title.

437
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,400
Even if you punish me with death.

438
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,850
For the sake of our kingdom,

439
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,720
I have no regrets.

440
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,890
You have such filial devotion,

441
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,120
I am deeply comforted.

442
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,280
But the empire,

443
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,920
how can it compare to flesh and blood?

444
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Thank you for your compassion, Father.

445
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,780
It's not strange that you think this way,

446
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,840
but

447
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,520
are you afraid I have the same thoughts?

448
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,720
So tell me about this matter first.

449
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,840
To dispel my thoughts.

450
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,080
I wouldn't dare, Father.

451
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,010
I wouldn't dare.

452
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
I've already said

453
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,120
The empire cannot compare to family ties.

454
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,680
I was only joking just now.

455
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,280
Since your thirteenth brother came alone,

456
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,160
His sincerity is commendable.

457
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,960
There's no need to worry for now.

458
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,760
However,

459
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,620
Thinking about staying in Dengzhou City for some time,

460
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,480
I increasingly feel that

461
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,840
The vegetarian meals at this Taoist temple

462
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,280
Are truly quite bland.

463
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,340
Nearby Yangjialing is famous throughout the land for its celestial horses.

464
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,500
I tried them once when I passed by many years ago.

465
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,860
I miss it very much.

466
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,360
You two brothers go hunting and bring back some game.

467
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,000
Yes.

468
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,320
That's all I saw.

469
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,600
I understand.

470
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,760
The Crown Prince and the Prince of Jingnan have gone to Yangjialing with their men.

471
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,290
Judging from their attire,

472
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,850
they must be going hunting.

473
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,360
But this friend of yours seems quite useful.

474
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,020
Introduce me to him sometime.

475
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,730
Come, everyone.

476
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,240
Let me introduce myself.

477
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,280
I am Bao Mingliu,

478
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,760
known as Brother Bao.

479
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,800
If you need anything, you can find me at this place.

480
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,840
I thought he was your friend.

481
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,240
So you need to be careful.

482
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,760
He might only care about money, not people.

483
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,080
That's Brother Bao.

484
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
He's the one who renovated that inn.

485
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,320
Can we take advantage of their hunting trip

486
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
to try getting into the Taoist temple again?

487
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Brother Bao said those who went hunting

488
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,410
are only a few dozen men.

489
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,600
I have a risky plan:

490
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,840
kidnap the Crown Prince.

491
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,850
That would get our entire families executed.

492
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,400
For Axin,

493
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,440
I'm willing to pay any price.

494
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,810
I've been thinking these days,

495
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,250
since we can't get into the temple,

496
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,580
we should find a way

497
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,620
to make those inside come out.

498
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,680
This hunting trip by the Crown Prince and others

499
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,610
is the perfect opportunity for us.

500
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,400
The Crown Prince is not only the heir,

501
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
but he must also know a lot about the rejuvenation process.

502
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,000
But we know nothing about it.

503
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,520
There must be specific methods for rejuvenation.

504
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,640
If we capture the Crown Prince,

505
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,240
solve the mystery,

506
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,370
and learn the truth,

507
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,000
we can find the real Zeng Xin.

508
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,600
But the Crown Prince went up the mountain with so many people.

509
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,040
Do we have enough people?

510
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,290
From what I know,

511
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,600
Yangjialing has dense forests

512
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,730
and unique terrain.

513
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,440
In such conditions,

514
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,360
one person can seem like dozens,

515
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,480
and dozens might effectively be just one.

516
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,760
But just the four of us won't be enough.

517
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,800
We also need

518
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,640
Xie Jingtang.

519
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,160
Help me kill someone.

520
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,980
Is it Gu Tingmei again?

521
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,720
We have a more urgent matter now.

522
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,840
The Crown Prince and his party are going hunting in the mountains.

523
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,720
We need to capture him.

524
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,400
We need your help.

525
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
You help me first.

526
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,340
If it's too difficult for you,

527
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,540
you don't have to kill him.

528
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,930
Just bring him to me.

529
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,120
I'll do it myself.

530
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,930
Is that acceptable?

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,360
We can help you,

532
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,760
but as you said yourself,

533
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,600
the Gu family's influence is not to be underestimated.

534
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,080
If we rashly offend them,

535
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,320
it could jeopardize our current plans.

536
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,280
So we can't rush this.

537
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,320
Let me think of a solution.

538
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,520
I can't wait.

539
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,920
Do you know back then,

540
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,730
why the Crown Prince caught us so quickly?

541
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,220
It was Gu Tingmei who betrayed us.

542
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,360
He got my father killed.

543
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,480
A father's murder.

544
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,960
I can't wait.

545
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,210
I'm just asking you to help me deal with a mere Gu Tingmei,

546
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,280
while you're asking me to help kidnap the Crown Prince!

547
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,340
Do you know how serious that crime is?

548
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,890
But I'm telling you,

549
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
I don't care.

550
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,320
I can help you,

551
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,970
as long as I can have my revenge.

552
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,880
I'll accept execution if necessary.

553
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
What I mean is we need to plan carefully before acting,

554
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,540
not act rashly out of impulse.

555
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
Let me think

556
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,130
if there's a way to satisfy both needs.

557
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,970
After all this talk,

558
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,420
you just don't want to help me.

559
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,240
When you asked for my help,

560
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,880
when did I ever hesitate?

561
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,380
Now that I need you,

562
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,840
it's all excuses.

563
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
To help you,

564
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,800
even my father...

565
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,840
Gu Tingmei said

566
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,680
I don't have a single friend.

567
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,920
He was right.

568
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,440
Looks like your plan needs to be put on hold.

569
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,929
Let me talk to him again.

570
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,159
What I mean is

571
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,199
I can't help you either.

572
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
As I said before,

573
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,159
kidnapping the Crown Prince would get nine generations of your family executed.

574
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,360
I have Tongtong to think about.

575
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,280
And Aunt Ji too.

576
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,920
It's okay.

578
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,199
I understand.

579
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,719
I did it for my family.

580
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,200
They did too.

581
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,680
Clerk,

582
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,080
bring more wine, please.

583
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,760
Young master,

584
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,680
we're out of wine.

585
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,520
Don't lie to me.

586
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,660
After you drank with the master last time...

587
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
He told me to give away what was left.

588
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,000
He said

589
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,770
you don't want him to drink,

590
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,610
so he'll try to quit.

591
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,280
Young Master.

592
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,680
Wait a moment.

593
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,680
Young Master.

594
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,520
Let me borrow your knife.

595
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,490
Tell Gu Tingmei to come out!

596
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,800
Get him out here!

597
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,530
Tell him to come out!

598
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,170
Where's your young master?

599
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,890
Tell Gu Tingmei to come out!

600
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,160
Who are you?

601
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,560
Who do you think I am?

602
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,740
What do you think I'm here for?

603
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,610
Where is Gu Tingmei?

604
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,490
Tell Gu Tingmei to come out!

605
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,800
Get him out here!

606
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
Come out!

607
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,840
Come out now!

608
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,760
Gu Tingmei!

609
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,320
Come out!

610
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,840
Stop!

611
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,240
You're asking for death!

612
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,120
Isn't this Xie Jingtang?

613
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,080
Acting so tough!

614
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,200
What did I tell you last time?

615
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
Do you have a bad memory?

616
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,620
Or are you just not listening?

617
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,480
Those ears of yours seem useless!

618
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,120
That hurts!

619
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,840
Good, it's supposed to hurt.

620
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,440
I'm not using much force.

621
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,640
Have to cut slowly.

622
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,440
Bear with it a little.

623
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,440
If you've got the guts, just finish me off quickly.

624
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,120
If you die quickly, then I won't be happy.

625
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,820
Who goes there?

626
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,880
How dare you break into the Gu mansion!

627
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,210
Do you have a death wish?

628
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,440
Am I dreaming?

629
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,400
It's real.
