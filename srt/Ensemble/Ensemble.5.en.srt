343
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,929
(Sena) Sorry I don't know anything either...

344
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,867
(Shoko) Thank you for keeping me waiting. (Ui) Thank you.

345
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,870
(Shoko) I also picked up Sena's favorite young corn.

346
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,371
(Sena) Thank you.

347
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,373
(Sakura) Hey, hey, look. (Sena) Huh?

348
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,376
(Sakura) Tamiya-kun occasionally sends photos.

349
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,379
(Sena) We're still good friends now, I'm glad.

350
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,882
(Sakura) I want to ride a balloon again! Let's go with Dad too.

351
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,885
(Ui) Yes. >> That's fine!

352
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,387
Ah, let's go with four of us next time.

353
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,891
(Ui) Yes, if everyone's plans are right.

354
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,894
(Shop clerk) Sorry for the wait, sorry.

355
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,396
Wow, it's here! (Sakura) Amazing!

356
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,398
(Shoko) I want everyone to eat.

357
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,400
(Sena) It's impossible for four of us to eat all of this.

358
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,402
>> If it's still there, you can just take it home.

359
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,405
(Sena) Stop asking for it with the assumption that I'll take it home anyway...

360
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,908
(Ui) But I haven't eaten since morning and am hungry.

361
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,910
Looks tasty. (Shoko) Is it true?

362
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,913
Ah, are you going to eat pizza? Pizza. >> Ah, wait and take a photo!

363
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,416
Sorry please take a picture.

364
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,485
With this...

365
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,357
(Whisper) Preparing for a big meal.

366
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,861
(Shoko) Sena-chan is after all, Ui-kun and Sakura-chan →

367
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,864
You look happiest when you're together.

368
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,866
(Sena) Mum just wants to see it like that.

369
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,868
>> Mom knows!

370
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:06,372
You need Ui-kun in your life!

371
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:10,944
I'm sure I'll be happy if we can all become a family together.

372
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,380
You know that Sena-chan is.

373
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,382
In living →

374
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,886
There is something more important than love or love.

375
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,955
Hehe.

376
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,392
(Kanako) Look, this is so nostalgic!

377
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,394
I want to go again.

378
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,397
(Madohara) Kanako There's a story.

379
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,467
>> This aquarium was fun, wasn't it? (Matohara) Listen carefully.

380
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:42,408
(Matohara) I liked Kanako but →

381
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,978
That wasn't romantic feelings.

382
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:50,850
That's what I liked with that feeling →

383
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,919
I've never seen it before.

384
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,357
So I don't think we should be together.

385
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,427
>> So it's fine if we can't see you again.

386
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,867
You've never had all the time together up until now.

387
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,369
(Matohara) Why that's what it is...

388
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,871
>> Get calm.

389
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,940
Think again.

390
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,382
(Matohara) Is it a settlement? (Eto) Yes.

391
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,884
(Eto) If you agree, we will withdraw our lawsuit →

392
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,888
Furthermore, we will pay a settlement of 10 million yen.

393
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,891
(Sena) Are you sue me and propose a settlement?

394
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,893
(Eto) Nagumo's current status →

395
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,895
I have a married wife.

396
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,897
(Matohara) Marriage? >> Yes.

397
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,401
I got married shortly after I broke up with Honoka.

398
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,403
(Matohara) Nagumo is a different woman than Honoka →

399
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,406
Does that mean they were dating at the same time?

400
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,842
>> Yes, just like Honoka-san →

401
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,846
I was living in an apartment with my current wife.

402
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,849
(Matohara) It also says "wife" here...

403
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,353
(Sena) In other words, she rents an apartment at the same time as two women →

404
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,856
Does that mean that you wrote in both contracts with your wife?

405
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:07,860
>> For him, he writes his wife in the lease agreement →

406
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:11,364
It means there is no special meaning.

407
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,366
So, who is Honoka?

408
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:16,936
This means it wasn't a common-law relationship.

409
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:22,875
Just... →

410
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:26,879
As a representative of a company, Nagumo will be in court that will damage the image →

411
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:30,383
I would like to avoid it if possible.

412
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,388
If you could promise not to mention this matter at all in the future →

413
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:40,893
I would like to end this by paying the settlement.

414
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,897
I apologize for the fact that I was dating another woman.

415
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:49,836
I think the settlement amount is not bad either.

416
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,406
Please consider it positively.

417
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,348
(Sena) Nagumo was married shortly after Hoka-san broke up.

418
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:05,852
It seems that the relationship period was also overlapping.

419
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,354
>> What? that….

420
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:10,356
(Matohara) "Nagumo had no intention of getting married" →

421
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,358
...but you said that →

422
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,360
Has there ever been any discussion about that?

423
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,363
>> You can understand without talking, since we've been together for five years.

424
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,368
(Matohara) Doesn't it mean that you've never checked it properly?

425
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,872
I don't think the other party is a common-law marriage.

426
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,874
This lease agreement is also available →

427
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,377
It's no longer a powerful evidence →

428
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,880
Isn't it okay to reconcile?

429
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,948
(Sena) Matohara-kun.

430
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:45,391
>> If... if we accept the settlement →

431
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:50,329
That means I wasn't my wife, right?

432
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,832
(Sena) That's what happened in the other party's settlement proposal.

433
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,834
>> If so, it won't be accepted.

434
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,836
There are witnesses over here.

435
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,338
(Sena) But Honoka... >> I was my wife!

436
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:02,842
It's been said that he's been living with him for five years -

437
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,911
I can't accept it.

438
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,348
(Matohara) Are you really going to be tried?

439
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:13,352
I don't think I'll ever win.

440
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,355
Koyama-san!

441
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,424
(Sena) Ha...

442
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,862
I want to snuggle with Honoka.

443
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,364
(Matohara) But...

444
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,366
(Sena) Witnesses will also come.

445
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,435
You have to fight until the end.

446
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,013
(Sena) Next, we will show you Exhibit No. 2.

447
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:47,453
(Sena) Sakimoto-san At this party you participated in →

448
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,956
What did you perceive of the relationship between Honoka and Nagumo?

449
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,958
>> I thought it was a common-law relationship.

450
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,960
(Sena) Why did you think so?

451
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,462
(Sakimoto) Even if everyone knows that he wrote "wife" →

452
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,966
Nagumo was not denying it and was having fun.

453
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:03,469
(Sena) This makes me think that Nagumo also had a will to marry him.

454
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,538
That's all.

455
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,978
(Judge) should begin cross-examination of the plaintiff's agent.

456
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,980
(Eto) Yes.

457
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,982
You were at a party five years ago →

458
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,985
Nagumo and Honoka had a common-law relationship →

459
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,554
Did you really recognize it?

460
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,991
yes.

461
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,993
I see.

462
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:31,063
Now, we will submit new Iku No. 6 as evidence of impeachment.

463
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,502
picture….

464
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:40,006
(Eto) This is Sakimoto-san immediately after the party →

465
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:44,010
This is the email screen where you interacted with other participants.

466
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,012
Eh, I'll read it out.

467
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:49,015
"Honoka-chan was really happy lol."

468
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,450
(Participant's voice) "Is Honoka really Nagumo's wife?"

469
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,452
(Participant's comments) "I watched it thinking I was just a lover."

470
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,455
(Participant's voice) "I feel like I'm alone and excited."

471
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,458
(Eto) "Poor... ha ha."

472
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:02,461
And at the end of the exchange, Sakimoto-san →

473
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:05,464
He replies "That's true."

474
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,466
(Buzzing)

475
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,968
What is this...

476
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,971
(Eto) At the time, you two were in a common-law relationship →

477
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,541
Maybe you didn't think about it?

478
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:20,479
That's probably... maybe.

479
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,481
(Eto) Well then, once more →

480
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,984
Please remember carefully and answer.

481
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,987
Those who were convinced that the two were common-laws:

482
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,556
Have you been there?

483
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,998
Probably →

484
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,000
not here.

485
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,002
(Eto) Nagumo gives Honoka →

486
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,004
That's what I didn't think of as a wife →

487
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:49,508
It must have been a well-known fact.

488
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,510
That's all.

489
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,948
(Nagumo) I'm trying to choose a marriage partner →

490
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:58,451
I lived with the two at the same time.

491
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,454
I spent five years living with Honoka, but →

492
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,457
It seemed he wanted to maintain the status quo.

493
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,960
When you think about walking through life together →

494
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,963
Choose the person who says "I want to get married" →

495
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,965
Isn't that obvious?

496
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,968
What is that...

497
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,970
It's too bad! (Sena) Honoka-san.

498
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,973
>> I'm just →

499
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,476
I'm happy to be by your side...

500
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,479
(Judge) Please refrain from making comments unless you are being asked.

501
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:30,483
I'm proud to be able to support your work →

502
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,487
I'm happy...

503
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:38,991
So I'm going to stop wanting anything more...

504
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,494
Honoka hasn't said anything specific.

505
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,563
(Honoka) I thought he would understand without talking.

506
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,501
(Honoka) I →

507
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,569
You're your wife.

508
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,505
(Judge) Stay quiet!

509
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,943
That's what they thought.

510
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,445
Wife Wife →

511
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,448
In the end, the goal is to divide the assets, right?

512
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:15,461
♪～
