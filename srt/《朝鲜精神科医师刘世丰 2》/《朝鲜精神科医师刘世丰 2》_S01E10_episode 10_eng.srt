1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:09,930

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,370

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,050

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,190

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,020

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,000

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,300
Having trouble breathing?

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,990
Aigoo, it's about time you're quiet!

9
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,420
No!

10
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,930
Lady Eun Woo.

11
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,000
Lady Eun Woo.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,530
Lady Eun Woo!

13
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,820
Please.

14
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,540
P-Please.

15
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,770
Please stop it now!

16
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,230
You... You asshole!

17
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,530
One,

18
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,710
two,

19
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,370
three.

20
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,770
Physician Yoo.

21
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,420
Lady Eun Woo.

22
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,460
Physician Yoo.

23
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,200
♫  In my foolishness, I kept my feelings from you  ♫

24
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,870
You saved me

25
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,520
yet again this time.

26
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,850
No.

27
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,050
You saved me, Lady Eun Woo.

28
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,610
♫  Fluttering in the wind gently   ♫

29
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,490
I gave you acupuncture with this hand.

30
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:39,290
♫  If I can send the feelings that seep out of my heart  ♫

31
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,360
You did great.

32
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,650
Great job.

33
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,610
♫  Spending my days loving and missing you  ♫

34
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,020
♫  The one thing that remains constant  ♫

35
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,140
♫  The one I love is you  ♫

36
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,900
♫  The very words "I love you"  ♫

37
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,590
♫  I've shouted from my heart hundreds of times  ♫

38
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:16,220
♫  But I can't say aloud, so I'll wait one more day  ♫

39
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,440
I won't let them get away with this!

40
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,190

41
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,470
Aigoo, shit!

42
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,720
Stop wasting your energy since you're already wounded.

43
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,990
Move it!

44
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,220
I can't move aside in fear of you

45
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,490
dying without getting punished!

46
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,690
Stop running your mouth!

47
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,640
Why would I get punished?

48
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,510
That physician's the one who needs to be punished.

49
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,900
His Majesty has just ordered to investigate you thoroughly for making false accusations.

50
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,800
I'm arresting you, Ahn Hak Soo.

51
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,810
I will not die yet.

52
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,620
You'll be acting tough even when you're dead.

53
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,740
Unless you want to lose more blood, shut your mouth.

54
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,160
Looks like you're fated to live since you met a great physician.

55
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,980
You laugh?

56
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,300
You could die right now, you punk.

57
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,320
Hey, Jeon Kang Il!

58
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,500
Stay awake!

59
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,380
Jeon Kang Il!

60
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,710
Physician Yoo.

61
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,000
I am really fine now.

62
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,270
I can walk on my own.

63
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,560
How did you dare to

64
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,570
follow him that late at night by yourself?

65
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,310
Do you not think of me?

66
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,590
I was so worried about you.

67
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,810
I thought we would never be able to find you.

68
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,100
I saw traces of blood at the municipal office building

69
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,060
and got worried sick that something

70
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,620
might have happened to you.

71
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,090
My hands and feet are still shaky.

72
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,180
How are you going to walk down the mountain

73
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,040
when your hands and feet are shaky?

74
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,920
I cannot let you down, even if it is uncomfortable.

75
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,840
Fine, then.

76
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,590
In that case, I am going to stick to this broad and cozy back for life.

77
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,010
Was that supposed to be a threat?

78
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
Yes.

79
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,650
Did it not work?

80
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,000
No.

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,220
It did not work.

82
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,610
I am never letting you down.

83
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,980

84
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,990
His pulse is stable now, and his wound is closing.

85
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,420
Why is he still not waking up?

86
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,030
That is my question.

87
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,180
I have so many questions once he awakes.

88
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,200
This guy isn't that weak.

89
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
He'll wake up.

90
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,380
Perhaps he might be having a long dream.

91
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,180
When you hate someone,

92
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,770
it takes quite a toll on your body.

93
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,750
Perhaps he's struggling to erase those memories in his dreams,

94
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,160
and that's why he can't wake up.

95
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,950
Yoo Se Yeop.

96
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,700
How dare you question my qualifications as a physician?

97
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,310
 What kind of acupuncture did you give to cause her pulse to stop?

98
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,400
 He slipped while trying to show off.

99
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,520
 How absurd.

100
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,370
That physician from back then?

101
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,590
 My name is Jeon Kang Il.

102
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,840
 A physician who cannot save their patients,

103
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,320
 are they qualified to be a physician?

104
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,700
So that's why he was hostile.

105
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,010
Are you awake now?

106
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,960
I remembered

107
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,980
where I had met you from.

108
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,600
It was when I was unable to be considerate of others.

109
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,900
I was fighting to erase

110
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,000
my memories of you the entire time I lay here.

111
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,500

112
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,510
Physician Gye, please take good care of Lady Eun Woo.

113
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,750
She keeps acting lively, but her meridians are...

114
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,430
Of course, we'll take care of Young Lady.

115
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,820
Don't even worry.

116
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,590
You just go and save yourself properly.

117
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,390
You save yourself first, then save each other.

118
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,470
After that, you can save patients.

119
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,510
Even His Majesty is getting prepared.

120
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,240
They were false accusations, were they not?

121
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,810
Due to your internal strife,

122
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,190
you envied and ousted the skilled Physician Yoo.

123
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,800
Now, obsessed with this false petition,

124
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,680
you prevented him from treating the people!

125
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,520
How can I trust such a Royal Clinic

126
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,870
with the well-being of the Royal Family?

127
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,950
Your Majesty, we must identify whose fault it is—

128
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,490
I am just about to do that.

129
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,980
Former Royal Physician Jeon Kang Il, raise your head.

130
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,380
Tell me about the murder at Sorak County as it is.

131
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

132
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,980
Sorak County Governor Ahn Hak Soo, after submitting a false petition to frame Yoo Se Yeop,

133
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:18,170
blackmailed and threatened a woman to seduce Yoo Se Yeop to make it look true.

134
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:24,350
When things did not go as he wanted... he murdered the said woman.

135
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,400
How come that you know about this in such detail?

136
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,560
Your lowly servant is ashamed, but I helped him to submit the said false petition.

137
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,000
 Those lowly beings are better off dead.

138
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,300
 They died because they deserved to die.

139
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,710
 A person died because of us.

140
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,780
 Let's try denying it until the end.

141
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,000
 You see, it's always the weak ones who deserve punishment.

142
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,320
 Honestly, what did I even do wrong?

143
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,540
 You need to beg the dead woman for forgiveness, at least.

144
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,400
 I am going to confess my sins to His Majesty and accept punishment.

145
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,910
Ahn Hak Soo, who committed murder, will be beheaded.

146
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,780
Former Royal Physician Jeon Kang Il,

147
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,520
since you contributed greatly to solving the case,

148
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,940
you will meet a lighter sentence and be exiled.

149
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,800
Additionally, the Royal Clinic, which was manipulated by him,

150
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,810
will have its personnel replaced,

151
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,130
from top to bottom in its entirety,

152
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,050
for its responsibilities.

153
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,090
Enter, Chief Royal Physician Yoo Se Yeop, and hear my decree.

154
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:00,150
The new Chief Royal Physician will be appointing new personnel to the Royal Clinic.

155
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,020
Physician Jeon.

156
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,470
Since your pulse is stable and your complexion peaceful,

157
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,140
you are very healthy.

158
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,680
I am relieved to have you by my side.

159
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,120
It hasn't been easy for you, has it?

160
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,260
I am sorry for making you worry, Your Majesty.

161
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,700
This is all because you are still unmarried, isn't it?

162
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,090
Hey, now. Do not just smile.

163
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,350
You need to consider marriage seriously now.

164
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,650
I will look for a bride for you.

165
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:01,050
Your humble servant has a woman he loves.

166
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,180
You cannot!

167
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,280
Even after that experiencing ordeal.

168
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,510
A marriage with a widow, on top of that.

169
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,280
I cannot allow it.

170
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,430
Your Majesty, there is one request I have besides marriage.

171
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,590
- Se Yeop. 
 - Your Majesty.

172
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,190
That woman is a great physician.

173
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,910
I implore you to hire her, so she can practice medicine

174
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,200
in the Royal Clinic, and protect her, please.

175
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,750
What do you mean by that?

176
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,450
If you and that female physician are together,

177
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,800
the remaining disgruntled individuals in the Royal Court will get to you.

178
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,160
As soon as the Royal Clinic is reformed,

179
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,160
I will be going back to Sorak County.

180
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,040
Will your love be fulfilled even if you are not together?

181
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,570
Yes.

182
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,570
That person being safe,

183
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,940
being happy, and growing up like that as a person,

184
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,900
are my biggest happiness.

185
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,100
Lady Eun Woo!

186
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,910
- Physician Yoo! 
 - Oh, my, Young Master!

187
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,400
- How long has it been? 
 - Aigoo.

188
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,090
Your face is looking even better!

189
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,430
What is this?

190
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,220
I made them myself when I was studying for the medical exam.

191
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,280
Whoa, so nicely organized.

192
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,710
You could go and open a tutoring group in Hanyang.

193
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,700
You can be my first student to succeed, Lady Eun Woo.

194
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,340
Lady Eun Woo, you cannot just learn from me anymore.

195
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,530
You need to go out to the bigger world and learn higher medicine.

196
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,780
Please take the female physician exam.

197
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,730
I came back after putting everything down.

198
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,350
So now it is time for you to go.

199
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,250
Physician Yoo.

200
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,310
Have I just given you a burden with unnecessary words?

201
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,190
No.

202
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:29,720
It is clearly an incredible thing for me to leave you and

203
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,880
learn higher medicine in the bigger world.

204
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,560
However,

205
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,130
for some reason, a corner of my heart feels empty.

206
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,570
Lady Eun Woo, you are a special person.

207
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,330
You are also a special physician.

208
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,270
Even before you were a physician, you saved my life and

209
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,350
you will save even more people in the future.

210
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:03,870
Is that why you always give me such hard assignments?

211
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,530
Because there is no one who can do it besides you.

212
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,420
Your heart that feels empty for now

213
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:20,720
will be filled with a larger warmth after much time passes by.

214
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,470
I hope... that will be the case.

215
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,870

216
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,410
You are appointed as the head of the

217
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,400
Office of the Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Queen's Pavilion under the Royal Clinic.

218
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,070
You had a perfect score on the exam.

219
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,030
The Queen is with a child,

220
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,390
but the Royal Clinic is worried about gestosis.

221
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,840
Until the prince is born, please take care of the Queen's health.

222
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

223
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,700
I will tend to Her Majesty with all my heart.

224
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,360
Lady Eun Woo!

225
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,830
Physician Yoo!

226
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,700
How were you able to come back?

227
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,740
His Majesty called me on an urgent note.

228
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,430
Do you know what it is about?

229
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,710
I was told Her Majesty the Queen is pregnant.

230
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,390
Is it not good news for the Royal Family?

231
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,350
Is something wrong?

232
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,600
The Royal Clinic suspects gestosis, apparently.

233
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,940
She needs to be careful since it is her first pregnancy.

234
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,510
Please go to him quickly.

235
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,570
His Majesty is gravely worried.

236
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,700
Okay.

237
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,760
Until the child is born safely, I will need to stay at the Royal Clinic.

238
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,320
You should do that.

239
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,570
I will also help.

240
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,190
Yes.

241
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,510
His Majesty has an infectious fever again.

242
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,330
I am worried that he is having one illness after another lately.

243
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,360
What about using Sini powder

244
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,590
while protecting his body with velvet extracts?

245
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,640
Sini powder?

246
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,350
Starting with rhinitis, which causes a stuffy nose,

247
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,360
His Majesty's symptoms worsen into an infectious fever and cold every time.

248
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,950
So we need to use fever reducers,

249
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,190
but also protect his body, which is weakened from the cold.

250
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,450
That being so, let us try applying Physician Seo's treatment.

251
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,690
I also agree that we cannot rely solely on fever reducers anymore.

252
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,210
Worries about my first pregnancy,

253
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,830
worries about the suspected gestosis,

254
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,450
and worries about a possible breech birth due to the abnormal pregnancy.

255
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,270
I am full of worries and concerns all day.

256
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,300
Your Majesty, please do not worry too much.

257
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,780
Worries can actually be harmful.

258
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,800
Have you seen a case similar to mine in person?

259
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,470
Yes.

260
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,560
There was a patient who suffered all night because the child would not come out

261
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,120
due to gestosis and breech position,

262
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,550
and even got the treatment by a physician delayed by half a day.

263
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,430
So what happened to her?

264
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,630
Did the mother and the child both live?

265
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,150
Yes. She gave birth safely and

266
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,620
I hear they are both alive and well.

267
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,670
Therefore, please do not fear too much.

268
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,140
According to an acquaintance of mine,

269
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,400
you will actually do well on what you worry about.

270
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,140
It's what you don't worry about where bad things happen.

271
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,610
Did Physician Yoo Se Yeop say that?

272
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,030
How did you know?

273
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,350
You two are such a good pair, but...

274
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,420
it is a shame.

275
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,880
Not at all, Your Highness.

276
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,280
I somehow ended up experiencing the sorrow of becoming a young widow,

277
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,960
but I met many good people thanks to that and

278
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,510
I became a lifesaving physician.

279
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,240
And I also got to work in saving lives like this.

280
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,970
Giving birth to my own child and raising them is great,

281
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,120
but I think it is also a physician's perk to be

282
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,570
able to treat patients, thinking of each one as your

283
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,090
own child and family.

284
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,360
I will also think of you as my family and

285
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,220
treat you with all my heart.

286
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,490
So please do not worry too much.

287
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,060
Thank you.

288
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,010
- What are you doing here alone? 
 - Whoa!

289
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,530
I was going to give it to you secretly.

290
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,510
But it's so obvious who gave it to me.

291
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,540
Please open it once I leave.

292
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,870
I... I want to check right now.

293
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,230
♫  On a cold starry night  ♫

294
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,210
♫  I think of you more than ever  ♫

295
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,860
This is a clock, isn't it?

296
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,550
I am curious why you gave me such a valuable thing.

297
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,100
Firstly, I received my first pay.

298
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,050
First pay?

299
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,860
Yes.

300
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,410
Therefore, I wanted to give you something meaningful.

301
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,170
Although we do not know

302
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,920
where we will be headed yet,

303
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,180
but I hope we will find the way someday and

304
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,740
I hoped to be together forever.

305
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,670
So I am gifting you time.

306
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,740
♫  Where have you gone  ♫

307
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,650
For the rest of my life,

308
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,700
I will cherish them.

309
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,310
The time spent with you

310
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,640
and this clock.

311
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:22,280
♫  You don't have to hurt anymore  ♫

312
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:29,590
♫  If we can start over again  ♫

313
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:40,150
♫  I will take the first step toward you  ♫

314
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,760
What did you say? The Queen is

315
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,270
having a difficult delivery?

316
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,020
I must go right now and see how she is.

317
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,670
The baby was expected to come out feet first due to the breech position and

318
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,400
gestosis was a concern.

319
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,200
Therefore, we have been cauterizing the bladder meridian and using the eight herb extract.

320
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,920
That expectation was correct.

321
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,240
The breech position is causing a difficult delivery.

322
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,760
Prepare the replenishing medicine and ginseng soup.

323
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,400
- Hurry! 
 - Yes, Sir.

324
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,510
A little more. Just a little more, please!

325
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,830
I must give acupuncture.

326
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,540
Please go ahead.

327
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,090
Just... Just a little more!

328
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,750
Your Majesty!

329
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,860
Your Majesty, you cannot!

330
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,220
You cannot let yourself go!

331
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,660
Your Majesty!

332
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,560
I will give her acupuncture to her scalp, between her eyebrows, and above her upper lip.

333
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,840
Okay.

334
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,470
- One. 
 - One.

335
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,890
- Two. 
 - Two.

336
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,540
- Three. 
 - Three.

337
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,190
Your Majesty. Your Majesty, are you all right?

338
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,120
- Is it the replenishing medicine? 
 - Yes.

339
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,940
Give it to Physician Seo.

340
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,310
Your Highness, have some of this.

341
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,180
Your Majesty, please hang in there a little more.

342
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,760
You can do this.

343
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,210
Your Majesty.

344
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,880
His Majesty. Your Majesty.

345
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,160
His Royal Highness, the prince!

346
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,620
You did great.

347
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,840
You did really great.

348
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,710
Your Majesty, you just need to recover well, and you will be healthy.

349
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,630
It is all your achievement.

350
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:04,260
How did you learn such high medicine as a woman?

351
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,610
I learned it all from the Chief Royal Physician.

352
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,670
She did all of it on her own.

353
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,520
I merely watched from her side.

354
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,540
Your Majesty.

355
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,700
Physician Seo is a young widow,

356
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,800
who can never have a child of her own,

357
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,970
but she dedicated herself further to studying obstetrics,

358
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,170
gynecology, and pediatrics, thinking of all children as hers.

359
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,380
Therefore, she saved the prince and me.

360
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,110
Is it not a heartbreaking thing?

361
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,970
As such, I have a request.

362
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:47,310
Please restore Physician Seo's status as before marrying and

363
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,240
bestow upon her a ranking fitting her achievement.

364
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,050
That would be compensation for saving the prince and me.

365
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,200
However, that is...

366
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,530
 Did you expect this to happen?

367
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,470
You are a person who saves herself.

368
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,640
Also, not only will you save yourself,

369
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,390
but you will save my people and my citizens.

370
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,400
Therefore, I will do as the Queen said.

371
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:32,490
So please take good care of the Royal Family

372
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,080
and the people from now on.

373
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,170
Additionally, one of those people would be

374
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,950
Chief Royal Physician.

375
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,410
Do not forget that.

376
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,190
I am deeply thankful, Your Majesty.

377
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,740
Your Majesty.

378
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,440

379
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,400
Physician Seo Eun Woo has helped

380
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,880
with the birth of the prince who will become the crown prince,

381
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,670
and saved the Queen's life.

382
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,910
Therefore, rewarding her contributions to treating the Royal Family and the people,

383
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,980
she will be assigned the role of Chief Female Physician, an equal ranking as a Cabinet Minister.

384
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,700
Additionally, her false marriage done deceptively will be legally reset and

385
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,500
her status prior to marriage

386
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,290
restored.

387
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,520
The time is now. There.

388
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,250
Why are the medicinal herb prices rising so much?

389
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,540
I need to be making some profit here.

390
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,020
What the heck are they stuffing themselves with?

391
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,630
Gye Ji Han!

392
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,110
Stop with your temper and come here.

393
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,310
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

394
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,640
Here.

395
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,550
I'm good with folding these.

396
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,000
There! Done.

397
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,220
Physician Gye is very good.

398
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,440
Rub the parts that are stained and

399
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,670
flatten the parts that are wrinkled.

400
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,060
That's all you need to do.

401
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,880
Just do that from now on, too, okay?

402
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,320
There.

403
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,650
I also had

404
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,430
days when I was shining.

405
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,230
Your days are still shining.

406
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,220
Nice and shiny. You're the prettiest.

407
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,140
That's right.

408
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,800
I didn't know I'll get to live such days again.

409
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,920
 Poong!

410
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,400
 Poong!

411
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,430
I had become... a flower under the fences

412
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,240
of Gye Soo Clinic here.

413
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,920
You're a person who saves.

414
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,430
Giving water,

415
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,670
and light.

416
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,830
You make flowers bloom.

417
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,840
Aigoo, Granny, what's wrong? Why are you doing this?

418
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,570
Because it feels like it'll snow.

419
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:03,050
Before it snows, tell Poong and his bride to come.

420
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,760
 Poong!

421
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,150
Aigoo, I told you, Physician Yoo isn't here yet.

422
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,440
He'll come today.

423
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,330
So give me the flowery makeup today.

424
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,200
Pretty and prettier.

425
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,770
I got it.

426
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,420
Pretty and prettier.

427
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,090
Take a look.

428
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,240
How is it? Do you like it?

429
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,940
You're so beautiful.

430
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,640
So beautiful. It came out great!

431
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,930
 Everyone, come out. It's snowing outside!

432
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,730
- Aigoo, what's all this? 
 - Whoa!

433
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,340
- Whoa. 
 - Look at that!

434
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,720
Aigoo, aigoo.

435
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,150
It's really snow!

436
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,540
Take that!

437
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,450
Oh, my!

438
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,050
My back!

439
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,900
Last night, I saw Granny in my dreams.

440
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,480
It couldn't be a sign of something bad, right?

441
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,710
Of course not.

442
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,950
She came out in your dream because you missed her too much.

443
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,150
Since we bought all these treats,

444
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,660
she will greet us in health.

445
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,120
Yes.

446
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:10,650
Lady Eun Woo, by the way, I love you a lot.

447
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,190
Whoa, I was going to say it first.

448
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,860
You can just say it quickly right now.

449
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,450
Aigoo, what do we do?

450
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,370
M-My hand's stuck! My hand's stuck!

451
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,620
My hand! Aigoo!

452
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,920
One, two, three! Whoa.

453
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,110
How silly.

454
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,820
You're the most precious people in the world.

455
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,840
The chestnuts are all done!

456
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,820
Hurry up and come!

457
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,090
- There.
- It's so hot!

458
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,030
My Jang Goon!

459
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,920
Castor Beans!

460
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,020
Young Master!

461
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,970
- Poong! 
 - Young Lady!

462
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,950
Poong!

463
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,790
Poong.

464
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,470
You have been healthy, right?

465
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,300
Of course.

466
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,030
- What's that? 
 - You...

467
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,220
Hey!

468
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,180
- Did he just throw that? 
 - Aigoo.

469
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,080
L-Look at him go. So silly!

470
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,650
Come on now.

471
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,900
Wait, wait, wait.

472
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,240
Wait!

473
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,110
Tiring, wasn't it?

474
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,090
Coming all the way here.

475
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,730
Not tiring at all.

476
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:15,600
I guess we all need to sleep together tonight.

477
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,910
Since it's snowing.

478
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,600
- Ip Boon. 
 - Yes?

479
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,390
You...

480
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,630
must never lose your dream, okay?

481
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,150
Yes.

482
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,720
By the way, Granny, I think I have a new dream now.

483
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,400
Jang Goon,

484
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,260
my dearest boy.

485
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,830
There.

486
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,490
You go and do all the studying you want, okay?

487
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,940
Yes.

488
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,950
Granny, g-give me mine, too. Quickly.

489
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,010
Man Bok.

490
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,580
They're beans. Castor beans.

491
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,410
You, Castor Bean.

492
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,280
Reliable one.

493
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,150
Make sure to protect everyone, okay?

494
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,410
What?

495
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,090
Namhaedaek.

496
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,380
Seriously.

497
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,130
You're the most awesome.

498
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,060
Thanks to you, I ate well and have a good time here.

499
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,520
Is there something you want to eat?

500
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,210
Should we have rice cakes tomorrow?

501
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,960
I love it!

502
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,210
How dare you!

503
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,760
Se Poong,

504
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,690
Eun Woo.

505
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,740
You did well to stay alive, right?

506
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,460
You did well.

507
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,080
Isn't that true?

508
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,650
Yes.

509
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,150
You taught me, didn't you?

510
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,800
That you have to stay alive and wait.

511
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,140
Live another day, to save another life.

512
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,530
Aigoo, how old are you, seriously?

513
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,430
Jang Goon.

514
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,700
 Don't be sad, all of you.

515
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,200
 When the year's first snow falls,

516
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,540
 just think that I'm falling onto you.

517
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,270
 I don't want memorial services.

518
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,250
- You lost. 
 - Aigoo.

519
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,750
 If you must remember me,

520
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:25,180
 do so with a feast, not a memorial table.

521
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,750
Granny.

522
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:47,890
 Make sure to play some good music, so it won't be sad, okay?

523
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,650
Granny.

524
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:56,300
Where are you going?

525
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,210
Hyung pushes from the back like this

526
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,330
- and then... You need to pull me from the front. 
 - That's right.

527
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,250
- Give him a tug. 
 - Why am I the only one pushing?

528
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,630
- Aigoo, we're here! 
 - Pull me.

529
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,650
Have you been well?

530
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,200
Granny! We're here!

531
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,100
He has a beggar living in his stomach, I tell you.

532
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,790
- Lady Eun Woo. 
 - Physician Yoo,

533
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,120
you need to drink ginger water.

534
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,410
O-Okay, just water for now.

535
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,230
Lady Eun Woo, this is alcohol.

536
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:49,970
Whoa, n-no, do not drink—

537
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,490
- Are you okay? 
 - O-Oh.

538
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,140
According to Great Pharmacopoeia,

539
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,930
a cold stomach causes hiccups.

540
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:24,230
Therefore, if you rub clove oil on Middle Epigastrium...
  (T/N: Meridian on the abdomen)

541
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,050
Clove oil?

542
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:29,200
I am sure we have clove oil.

543
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,500
Middle Epigastrium?

544
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,960

545
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,310
No.

546
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,860
No, no.

547
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,690
I do not think I can.

548
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,400
We need some other method.

549
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,170
According to other various medical books,

550
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:58,410
you can cauterize or warm up the energy path meridian.

551
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,950
The one by the liver,

552
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,020
or the one by the leg?

553
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,420
The one by the liver.

554
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,340
Warm it up.

555
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,300
With your hand.

556
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,250

557
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,300
This cannot do, Physician Yoo.

558
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,190
What did he say? Great Pharmacopoeia?

559
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,780
I thought tonight would be a lost cause when he was talking about that.

560
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,020
Aigoo, that wasn't even the real crisis.

561
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,810
What if he drank alcohol?

562
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,050
That's why we should've taken out the alcohol completely!

563
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,490
If you hiccup for a long time, you'll die.

564
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:04,380
- We need to bring him moxibustion— 
 - Aigoo, don't worry, Jang Goon.

565
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,230
Chief Female Physician is next to him.

566
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,890
Do you think she would kill him?

567
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,600
No one knows that.

568
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,400
Whether she'd kill him or let him live tonight.

569
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,010
Aigoo, don't listen to her, Jang Goon. Let's go.

570
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:16,240
What—

571
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,640
Aigoo, well,

572
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,750
anyhow, they turned the light off,

573
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,300
- so we can rest easy. 
 - Yes, we should go now!

574
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,840
- Yes, let's go. 
 - Let's prepare a late-night snack table on this wedding night!

575
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:39,290

576
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:55,740
 Father, there's someone outside.

577
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,500
Father!

578
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,650
It's rice!

579
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,770
There are medicinal herbs, too!

580
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,820
It must be Grandma's.

581
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,630
The night goblin must've stopped by.

582
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,950
It's Doctor Robin Hood, right?

583
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,700
I want to see him!

584
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,870
 Whoa, there's rice!

585
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:23,260
 - Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

586
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,580
My goodness, you're as skilled as the rumors say.

587
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,180
- Goodness gracious. 
 - What great fortune you have.

588
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,100
You will be fine as long as you eat well.

589
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,510
Do not worry too much.

590
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,270
You may leave.

591
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,030
Next.

592
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,570
What ailment brings you here?

593
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,630
My stomach feels terrible.

594
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,950
- Come back any time if you need more. 
 - Thank you.

595
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,510
I will give you a single herb soup.

596
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,770
Please wait here a moment.

597
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,160
Physician Gye!

598
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,900
You punk.

599
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,890
Who said you could copy me?

600
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:08,730
I guess I did well to save your life.

601
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,810
Take a look.

602
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,040
Doesn't this make me a physician who saves many lives, too?

603
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,360
Look at how shameless you've become.

604
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:23,810
Very well. From now on, live your life building a good fortune.

605
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:26,640
Yes, that's the plan.

606
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,220

607
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,650
Physician Jang, what do you think?

608
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:40,820
When your stomach is hot, and you feel thirsty, and you can't eat due to nausea and hiccuping,

609
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,690
you must use exactly 1.875 grams of ginseng licorice.

610
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,020
But before that,

611
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,150
I shall administer acupuncture.

612
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,930
Such a skilled doctor!

613
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,130
I feel so refreshed.

614
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,720
What ailment brings you here?

615
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,630
I just can't fall asleep these days.

616
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,610
Tell me how this drawing makes you feel.

617
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,690
Slowly, as it comes to you.

618
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,060
You must train your mind and body,

619
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:21,500
so your body and soul become healthy.

620
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,540
Think about someone you hate.

621
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,990
All right, keep up with me.

622
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,790
Inhale the anger.

623
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:49,010
All right, are you all ready to eat voraciously?

624
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:50,440
 No.

625
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,120
 I don't want to eat.

626
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,040
Even though this fox is trying to eat the rabbits?

627
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,730
Who can help hide the rabbits?

628
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,670
 Me! Me! Me!

629
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,160
Hurry and hide them.

630
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,780
Hurry.

631
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:10,130
 Channel Manager: a_hauth_238

632
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:14,300

633
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,510
Welcome!

634
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,370
What can I get the two of you?

635
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,290
- Jeho-tang, please. 
 - Jeho-tang, please. 
  (Cold drink made with honey and several ingredients)

636

animarina_677 (General Editor) 
trangstar888 (Chief Editor)

638
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,960
Look here! What's wrong with you?

639
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,530
What's wrong? Someone help! Please help!

640
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,290
Was it something he ate that made him like this?

641
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,090
I don't think he can breathe.

642
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,340
 To all the language moderators and their translators, thank you for being part of our team!

643
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,280
 Oh my goodness.

644
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,360

645
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,800
Please.

646
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,660
Hand it to me.

647
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,350
Hurry.

648
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,070
Here.

649
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,930
Put the needle between his eyebrows.

650
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,420
Do you do acupuncture with words?

651
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,460
One,

652
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,730
- two, 
 - Two,

653
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,030
- three! 
 - three!

654
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,020
He's alive! Aigoo, he's alive!

655
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,070
- Aigoo, he's a skillful physician! 
 - What a skillful physician!

656
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,870
Aigoo, he's a skillful physician.

657
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,000
He's so skillful!

658
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,830
It must be problematic to be a physician

659
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,320
with a hand like that, isn't it?

660
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:05,430
I was just going to quit being a physician and become a lawyer.

661
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,070
Your countenance is not exactly trustworthy,

662
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,050
so how are you going to be a lawyer?

663
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,110
You also look like a sissy with a pretty face,

664
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,060
but you are still a physician, aren't you?

665
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,760
Your name is?

666
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,000
My name is Baek Gwang Hyeon.

667
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,490
Baek Gwang Hyeon.

668
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,480
I can fix that hand of yours for you.

669
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,610
You?

670
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,240
My hand?

671
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,580
No, thanks.

672
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,910
A half-wit who cannot even give needle treatment.

673
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:46,480
I guess he is not hungry enough yet.

674
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,690
When you change your mind,

675
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:53,560
you can feel free to come visit the clinic by the Gye Soo tree  (Laurel tree) .

676
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,070
Gye Soo tree?

677
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,080
Wait, are you perhaps—

678
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,060

679
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:27,230

680
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:33,230

681
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,090

682
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,580
Physician Yoo!

683
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,890
Why didn't you sleep in?

684
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:37,510
You look very tired these days, my wife.

685
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:40,100
Should I feel your pulse?

686
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:43,640
You can't.

687
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:48,240
What are you two doing so early in the morning?

688
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,030
Aigoo, seriously. We need to start the treatments right away.

689
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,680
Are you getting anything from her pulse?

690
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,400
Like good news, you know?

691
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,520
Aigoo, Namhaedaek, seriously!

692
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:02,400
Aigoo, what are you all doing, not getting ready?

693
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,220
- Father! 
 - Physician Gye!

694
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,660
I missed you.

695
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,860
Aigoo, Jang Goon, have you been well?

696
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,480
You're big enough to get married.

697
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,190
Aigoo, I should be the one to get married now.

698
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:21,030
Seeing how you got fat, you've been eating three bowls of rice per day, huh?

699
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,660
Father, you're the one who's looking handsome.

700
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,440
Am I getting a stepmother now?

701
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:32,530
I think it'll be faster for Half-wit and Young Lady to start a family.

702
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:38,960
We were going to ask you for good medicine anyway.

703
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,860
What kind of medicine?

704
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:44,300
Physician Gye...

705
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:50,720
What is your ailment?

706
01:02:51,820 --> 01:03:00,780

707
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,140
 I will look into your heart as well.

708
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:13,120
♫  You don't have to hurt anymore  ♫

709
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:20,520
♫  If we can start over again  ♫

710
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:29,220
♫  I will take the first step toward you  ♫

711
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:39,000
♫  You don't have to suffer so much anymore  ♫

712
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:52,860
♫  I love you for staying by my side just like now  ♫

713
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:57,070
♫  Show me how you feel  ♫

714
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:06,400
