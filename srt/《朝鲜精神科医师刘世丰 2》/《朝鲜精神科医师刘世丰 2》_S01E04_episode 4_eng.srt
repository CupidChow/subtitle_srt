1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:08,230

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,300

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,910

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,980

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,160

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,980

7
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,170
Give the needle treatment right here.

8
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,160
Why? Are you not able?

9
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,380
You used to be called the Divine Acupuncturist, right?

10
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,470
If you cannot insert a needle,

11
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,530
then you are no longer a physician.

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,210
I...

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,440
no longer give acupuncture.

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,840
You led a patient to suicide with neglect and misdiagnosis.

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,110
This is more than enough as a reason for the inspection.

16
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,610
It is not Physician Yoo's fault.

17
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,420
Saying the cause of every disease is the heart, and treating just with words,

18
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,300
is he really not wrong?

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,270
Do you think so?

20
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,510
 I...

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,550
 no longer give acupuncture.

22
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,300
You don't?

23
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,510
You mean, you can't.

24
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,390
What happened to your precious face?

25
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,810
Help yourself and eat some of this first.

26
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,370
I am fine.

27
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,420
So why go through this trouble in the countryside?

28
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,070
Come to the palace with me.

29
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,320
That is where you belong.

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,700
I have no intention to

31
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,140
marry you, Your Highness.

32
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,770
Do as you please.

33
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,800
Let's see who will win in the end.

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,300
What is this?

35
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,100
It is my patient's suicide note.

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,560
This is a suicide note?

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,640
You were arrested because of this?

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,050
Yes.

39
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,320
Stubborn as an ox!

40
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,600
If only you change your mind,

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,240
I can send the inspection team back any moment!

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,480
Stop being so stubborn and come to Hanyang with me!

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,810
Irrelevant to the inspection,

44
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,390
my patient is in critical condition.

45
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,940
As such, I cannot go anywhere.

46
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,380
- You are such a— 
 - Your Highness!

47
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,140
Let us be on our way now.

48
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,560
Righteous and pure-hearted man,

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,270
you have the perfect character to be a Princess's husband.

50
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,990
Don't you think?

51
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,590
Y-Yes.

52
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,410
Eat all of this and recover your spirits.

53
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,290
Also, don't worry, I will save you.

54
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,120
Please have some.

55
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,400
Your High–

56
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,760
Look at the sun coming up.

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,500
Holding him overnight, gosh.

58
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,170
My goodness.

59
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,920
The kid is looking pale and drained.

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,430
Physician Yoo.

61
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,870
Your face became haggard overnight.

62
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,420
Take your time and eat this.

63
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,730
I heard the inspector bastard harassed you, huh?

64
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,350
Gosh, that rotten bastard. His suspicions are ridiculous!

65
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,890
Hurry up and eat.

66
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,890
Once So Cheon wakes up, everything will be cleared up.

67
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,530
You need to eat and recover to fight.

68
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,000
I should not be doing this, I must go to the clinic immediately.

69
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,260
Gosh, he should eat before going.

70
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,730
Eat it on the way, then. Hurry.

71
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,930
Even the sun is rising now. Those bastards.

72
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,880
Physician Gye.

73
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,400
Yes, she got a lot better.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
She just needs to wake up now.

75
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,730
Perhaps it is fortunate.

76
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,440
Her skin is starting to heal, since she does not scratch in her sleep.

77
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,010
What could have happened to this child?

78
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,670
Please wake up soon and tell me.

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,750
Here. Drink up.

80
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,150
You look just like a patient right now.

81
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,090
I don't want to.

82
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,780
How can you offer alcohol when I cannot drink?

83
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,980
Especially when I'm supposedly a patient?

84
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,130
Fooled you, huh? It is a smoked-plum drink.

85
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,050
You are right.

86
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,760
So Cheon will wake up soon.

87
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,780
You do not need to guard her by yourself like that.

88
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,160
You even came to the municipal office to pick me up this morning.

89
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,940
Do you worry about me that much?

90
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,100
I guess you cannot do without me anymore.

91
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,550
You alone get to relax, and I have to run around everywhere.

92
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,040
That makes me sick. So what?

93
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,680
Right.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,300
That is more like you, Physician Gye.

95
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,330
Young Lady.

96
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,150
Young Lady!

97
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,650
This way!

98
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,290
You will really get me killed.

99
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,050
The new governor is different from your father.

100
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,720
He is seriously wicked.

101
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,590
All right. So I need to take a quick look.

102
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,560
I need to put it back right away!

103
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,110

104
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,230

105
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,450

106
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,430

107
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,540
So, it's indeed So Cheon's handwriting.

108
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,660
Does that mean, it really is So Cheon's suicide note?

109
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,950
What are you looking for?

110
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,570
A way to capture Yoo Se Yeop's heart.

111
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,710
Your Highness, it's dangerous!

112
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,660
What exactly are you looking for?

113
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,970
Careful.

114
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,040
Look here! I knew it was this one.

115
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,750

116
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,140

117
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,680
Yoo Se Yeop, come out quickly.

118
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,050
The thing that you saw is not a suicide note.

119
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,670
What do you mean by that?

120
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,150
If I tell you, what will you do for me?

121
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,670
If you are seeking something in return, I cannot accede.

122
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,420
You are just as suffocating as ever.

123
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,630
Gosh, I can just tell you free of charge, then.

124
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,090
I am not seeking something in return.

125
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,770
- I am making a request. 
 - A request?

126
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,490
You know how to do that?

127
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,000
 Really?

128
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,390
I will tell you in kind, warm words.

129
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,230
Do you really have no interest in marrying me?

130
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,290
Oh, my!

131
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,870
Just as you saved me, I also want to save you.

132
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,200
Whoa! Gosh.

133
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,530
Lady Eun Woo!

134
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,430
You always appear at these moments and hold me back!

135
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,260
I am deeply sorry. Well,

136
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,790
I came to get a chair, but...

137
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,150
I-I left it at the bookstore—

138
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,400
No, at the m-municipal office building.

139
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,620
- So Cheon's house! 
 - Right.

140
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,940
I-I will go to S-So Cheon's house.

141
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,140
Lady Eun Woo. Lady Eun Woo—

142
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,660
If you leave without answering me again,

143
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,260
I will throw you out along with her!

144
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,230
Your Highness, why are you doing this to me?

145
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,300
You have not finished listening to me!

146
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,600
I said I would save you.

147
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,910

148
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,220
- Gosh. 
 - There is nothing to even think about!

149
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,690
Who is serving as Physician Yoo's hands at the moment?

150
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,620
Lady Eun Woo is serving as Physician Yoo's hands!

151
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,600
That means they are as good as one body without a need to argue.

152
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,050
Would marriage not have realistic problems?

153
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,080
He has gone through too much trouble so far.

154
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,610
Lady Eun Woo might be happier with a person similar to her.

155
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,280

156
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,460

157
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,750

158
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,500

159
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,220
Yes, yes.

160
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,650
- Right, right. 
 - Right.

161
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,720
I need to think about it more.

162
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,370
 Do you really have no interest in marrying me?

163
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,710
 Just as you saved me, I also want to save you.

164
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,500
Lady Eun Woo!

165
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,260
Physician Yoo!

166
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,540
Please take a look at this.

167
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,900
The Princess came to give me this.

168
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,100
Why would she give this to you?

169
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,000
She said it is a novel she enjoys reading.

170
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:25,030
What was said to be So Cheon's suicide note is a transcription of a quote from this book.

171
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,810

172
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,850
"An agonizing disease that feels like bugs are crawling all over my body.

173
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,780
The disease was rejected and forsaken even by the physician."

174
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,410
 An agonizing disease that feels like bugs are crawling all over my body.

175
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,100
 The disease was rejected and forsaken even by the physician.

176
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,120
 If I cannot live and become one with my lover,

177
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,580
 I will become one with the disease and live because I cannot die.

178
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,530
 Now I will become one with the river and die because I cannot live.

179
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,970
This is talking about love sickness.

180
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,890
But somebody cleverly...

181
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,600
He cut off the top part and made it look like a suicide note.

182
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,460
That is right.

183
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,720
It was fabricated.

184
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,940
Who in the world would do this?

185
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,990
Could it be the Royal Clinic inspector?

186
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,380

187
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,610
It's not a suicide note.

188
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,070
It's a quote from a novel called "Hong Soon Wol's Story."

189
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,940
Somebody cut off the top part of

190
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,190
what So Cheon transcribed to make it look like a suicide note.

191
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,120
Are you saying I, the inspector, fabricated this?

192
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,660
I didn't even mention you.

193
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
You must feel quite guilty.

194
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,320
The governor has already finished the investigations.

195
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,820
Around the time when Lee So Cheon fell into the river, no one was around.

196
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,550
How do you know that?

197
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,000
Even when I bring you clear evidence,

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,630
will you try to hide the obvious?

199
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,900
Even if Lee So Cheon didn't attempt to kill herself,

200
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,560
it stays the same.

201
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,180
Your negligence of the patient.

202
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,210
That is the issue.

203
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,040
You only talk the talk.

204
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,500
If you are a physician,

205
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,130
you are probably aware of what a ridiculous thing you are saying.

206
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,070
If you did not fabricate it,

207
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,350
wouldn't it be proper to find the person who did it and investigate?

208
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,180
Arrogance and

209
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,850
neglect.

210
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,730
You are neither a true physician

211
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,410
nor a true inspector.

212
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Put that down.

213
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,000
It's a matter of life and death for my patient.

214
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,090
I will look into it myself.

215
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,730
Is our So Cheon doing better now?

216
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,620
Did she wake up?

217
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,530
She will wake up soon, so don't worry.

218
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,830
How was So Cheon at the paper mill?

219
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,810
Was the work too tough for her by chance?

220
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,690
All the work here is tough.

221
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,640
That is why we look out for each other like family.

222
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,470
So Cheon is liked by everyone.

223
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,370
We liked her a lot as well.

224
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,890
That is true. So Cheon is a good girl.

225
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,530
She is really a good girl who helped out with our tasks, too.

226
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,280
Do you mind telling me who found So Cheon's suicide note?

227
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,370
I took it to the municipal office building.

228
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,230
That morning, after So Cheon left the paper mill,

229
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,580
I saw it was left on So Cheon's seat.

230
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,280
I see.

231
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,790
She often said she wanted to go into the river.

232
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,460
The river?

233
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,020
Yes.

234
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,760
Since her body itches, she said it was refreshing to wash in cold water.

235
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,420
She wished to just live in the river.

236
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,860
Yoo Se Yeop! I'm here.

237
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,190
Your Highness, the book you gave me—

238
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,670
I know, I know.

239
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,030
You are totally thankful to me, right? You're speechless, right?

240
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,390
Yes.

241
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,860
I am sure So Cheon will be thankful as well, Your Highness.

242
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,310
Of course.

243
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,800
- Then, what will you do for me— 
 - In that case,

244
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,440
please stay and relax as much as you want. I have to get back to work.

245
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,450
Hey, kid. G-Go over there and do it.

246
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,630
This is Jang Goon's seat.

247
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,550
Physician Gye told Jang Goon to work here.

248
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,140
Are you disobeying the princess' order?

249
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,710
Your Highness, you said it is cramped here.

250
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,110
Why do you bother to stay here?

251
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,820
Do you know what an important person I am?

252
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,590
Your Highness,

253
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,400
why don't you read this?

254
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,560
- What is it? 
 - Shall I?

255
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,700
You need to read a lot of these to learn about romantic feelings.

256
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,300
What's that?

257
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,480
I will read it carefully and give it back to you.

258
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,540
Oh, my! You know how to read?

259
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,920
Your Highness, Jang Goon is a genius.

260
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,840
He even reads medical books.

261
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,040
Really? You are cute. Come here.

262
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,350
- How cute. 
 - This one is grilled perfectly.

263
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,990
Jang Goon, try one of these.

264
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,430
Here.

265
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,420
How is it?

266
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,320
This is the heavenly taste

267
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,980
that Physician Gye talks about!

268
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,650
Hey, that is what Father says when he drinks.

269
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,030
You cannot compare those two.

270
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,770
So? Would you like to try one?

271
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,860
The outside is crispy and

272
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,930
the inside is chewy.

273
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,990
This is grilled perfectly, crispy and chewy.

274
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,990
I am a noble princess.

275
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,290
I do not eat those lowly things like you.

276
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,140
Aigoo, seriously.

277
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,130
Then, could I try one, please?

278
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,840
Sure, try one. Here.

279
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,730
Dip it in here.

280
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,040

281
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,540
How could such a taste...

282
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,920
It's sweet, salty,

283
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,300
and it is twice as nutty.

284
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,600
- It is so delicious. 
 - Right?

285
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,240
Well, since you want me to, I will taste it for you.

286
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,800
Do you want to try it?

287
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,430
Your Highness, please eat these.

288
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,920
You need to eat garlic to become a human.* 
   (Referring to a Korean folktale)

289
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,350
What is this?

290
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,900
Were you insulting me, calling me a bear*? 
   (Referring to Korean folktale)

291
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,580
Court Lady Jung! What are you doing? Throw them all out!

292
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,200
Y-Yes, Your Highness.

293
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,410
This?

294
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,980
Please do not be angry anymore.

295
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,980
How is it?

296
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,500
Should I throw them all out?

297
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,970
Yes, just throw them out.

298
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,430
- Yes, throw them out. 
 - W-W-Wait.

299
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,220
If you throw them out, what about the rice cakes?

300
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,890
You can dip it in here.

301
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,650
You seem to like it. Right?

302
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,550
It's all right.

303
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,080
 Why did she cover everything in ink?

304
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,650
 Why would she write something and cover it up?

305
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,950
I see you haven't gone to bed yet.

306
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,200
Yes.

307
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,070
Have some. It's warm.

308
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,360
It is warm indeed.

309
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,820
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

310
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,550
What could it be?

311
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,780
Is it me by chance?

312
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,110
Yes.

313
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,070
Your patient, So Cheon.

314
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,500
I just cannot understand her.

315
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,800
Why would she cover what she wrote with ink?

316
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,890
Could she have not liked what she wrote?

317
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,320
That could be the case, since So Cheon is a writer.

318
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,900
She was such a diligent and good child.

319
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,390
Of course.

320
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,130
All of So Cheon's friends I saw during the day at the paper mill also liked

321
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,770
and sincerely worried for So Cheon.

322
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,250
So Cheon told me that she would write her own story.

323
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,940
She said she'll try to be brave.

324
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,760
But what could have changed her heart all of a sudden?

325
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,710
A story only she can read.

326
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,680
A story about herself.

327
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,670
A diary.

328
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,210
It is a diary.

329
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,880
How can we check the contents when they are all covered in ink?

330
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,290
Jang Goon, what is wrong?

331
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,470
Did you have a scary dream?

332
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,720
Her Highness the Princess.

333
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,860
- Her Highness the Princess! 
 - Her Highness the Princess?

334
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,550
Did she say something to you, too?

335
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,770
"It came even to my house today."

336
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,170
"I am so scared."

337
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:49,010
- "A heart that hates someone to this extent." 
  - A heart that hates someone to this extent.

338
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,710
- "Where does it come from?" 
  - Where does it come from?

339
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,880
- "I am afraid." 
  - I am afraid.

340
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,960
"You need to read a lot of these to learn about romantic feelings."

341
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,540
She told me kindly like that

342
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,320
and gave me such a scary book!

343
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,530
T-The contents are so scary!

344
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,910
T-They are tormenting me!

345
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,850
It's okay. It's okay.

346
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,390
If I do this, you will be able to fall asleep.

347
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,610

348
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,530

349
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,050
Physician Yoo, it is So Cheon's handwriting.

350
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,510
It has the same cover as this inked book.

351
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,310
They are both So Cheon's diaries.

352
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,450
Someone intentionally covered it in ink to hide the contents.

353
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,300
In that case, why did they fail to cover this book?

354
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,280
What's weirder is, why was this intact diary in Her Highness the Princess' hands?

355
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,380
I know.

356
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,440
It's not like I can ask her.

357
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,950
Please do not worry. I will ask.

358
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,750
No. I will ask myself.

359
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,950
It is not because I want to meet Her Highness.

360
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,330
I'm afraid she'll speak harshly to you–

361
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,000
No, you cannot.

362
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,980
I would rather do it than have you do it, Physician Yoo.

363
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,090
Do not stop me.

364
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,460
I will.

365
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,990
Gosh, seriously.

366
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,900
I can't believe I'm out here in the middle of nowhere.

367
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,970
Your Highness, please calm down.

368
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,950
Your Highness!

369
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,220
You were here already?

370
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,690
How dare you make me wait on top of calling me out?

371
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,880
- You dodged? You did it on purpose! 
 - Your Highness!

372
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,560
I am sorry, Physician Seo.

373
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,450
- Her Highness slipped by accident— 
 - What do you mean?

374
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,190
The princess of this nation does not make mistakes.

375
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,490
How dare you, on top of being late!

376
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,810
I did not come late, but you came early, Your Highness.

377
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,730
Unless you were here before me, you are late, of course.

378
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,460
Anyway, why would you want to see me?

379
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,400
It is just as the letter said.

380
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,660
I have something to ask you.

381
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,360
You know this book, right?

382
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,990
Yes. Why?

383
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,020
Please tell me why you had this book, Your Highness.

384
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,050
Why do I need to be kind enough to tell you that?

385
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,890
Because you

386
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,040
cherish Physician Yoo.

387
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,560
If you tell me about this book,

388
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,310
he can get out of the hardship the inspector is giving him.

389
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,960
I am the one who will save Yoo Se Yeop, not you!

390
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,990
I can even just send back a mere inspector.

391
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,550
You also heard how I found "Hong Soon Wol's Story"

392
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,540
and discovered the truth about the suicide note for him, right?

393
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,620
Yes.

394
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,280
So please also tell me this time.

395
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,650
- That is a simple— 
 - Hey!

396
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,590
Court Lady Jung!

397
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,030
If I tell you,

398
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,600
then what will you do for me?

399
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,530
Make a promise to me.

400
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Hear what it is at a later time.

401
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,470
Lady Eun Woo, what did Her Highness say?

402
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,640
Just follow me. You will know when we get there.

403
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,100
W-Well, the thing is So Cheon wouldn't give me the next volume.

404
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,330
Do you mean the seventh volume of "So Cheon's Farewell Song"?

405
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,770
The newest one?

406
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,320
Yes, Young Lady.

407
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,120
But there was no one at her house.

408
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,570
People who were waiting for it were bugging me so much.

409
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,690
So I hurriedly brought anything I could grab to have its copies made in advance.

410
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,400
When was that?

411
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,410
It was a few days ago.

412
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,660
That means the book you had put aside in the corner to copy

413
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,500
 was taken along with other books when Her Highness borrowed them.

414
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,700
Yes!

415
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,760
Y-Yes! T-That is correct!

416
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,190
What So Cheon wanted to say...

417
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,270
I think I can finally hear her out.

418
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,800
 So Cheon woke up!

419
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,160
So Cheon, have you regained your senses?

420
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,850
Physician Yoo.

421
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,280
There, there.

422
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,760
I am sorry.

423
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,680
What do you mean?

424
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,980
You were going through such a hard time.

425
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:52,300
Who are "those people" written in here?

426
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,300

427
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,760

428
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,240
 - Thank you. 
 - Good job.

429
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,640
 No!

430
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,720
 You should seriously wash.

431
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,500
 - Please stop! 
 - I guess she doesn't wash.

432
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,450
 How filthy!

433
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,000
Physician Yoo,

434
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,490
could you pretend not to know anything just once, please?

435
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,570
I am too scared.

436
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,780
If I speak up about this, I will be harassed even more.

437
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,710
Including me,

438
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,430
all of us will help you.

439
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,840
So Cheon,

440
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,500
please allow me

441
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,680
to do something for you as well.

442
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,110
 To be honest, for the last year

443
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,630
 I was in a lot of pain too.

444
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,850

445
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,240
 Due to your story,

446
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,330
 my pain was consoled so much.

447
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,720
This time I want to be your strength.

448
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,780
We will protect you to the end.

449
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,090
So you should also trust...

450
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,540
No,

451
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,440
could you try trusting yourself?

452
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,310
You! Stop inspecting now and go back!

453
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,960
Then, what about your goal, Your Highness?

454
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,850
I think I can achieve my goal on my own.

455
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,260
I will capture Yoo Se Yeop's heart on my own.

456
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,450
So you better stop treating Yoo Se Yeop with disrespect!

457
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,090
How dare you grade him?

458
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,410
I cannot do that, Your Highness.

459
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,520
What? Have you forgotten our promise?

460
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,410
No, it's you who has forgotten our promise, Your Highness.

461
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,420
We are already on the same boat and

462
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,860
I already told His Majesty I would inspect Gye Soo Clinic.

463
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,300
The die is cast. I cannot go back empty-handed.

464
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,580
You're saying you'll do it anyway? Even though I told you not to?

465
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,510
Because

466
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,930
that is the Royal Decree.

467
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,340
So Cheon did not attempt suicide.

468
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,860
I will summon Lee So Cheon and hear from her.

469
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,620
So move.

470
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,370
You are going to take a patient who has just gained consciousness?

471
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:25,270
You are no different from those who pushed So Cheon into that state.

472
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,620
Did you not come down to perform a fair and just inspection?

473
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,030
That is why I'm saying I will summon her and investigate.

474
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,950
No, you cannot take her.

475
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,790
As the physician of the heart,

476
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,100
I will let So Cheon heal her own illness.

477
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,420
If I cannot do so,

478
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,630
I will give up everything.

479
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,610
Will you also quit being a physician?

480
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,230
In that case, I will accept.

481
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,230
If I must go that far then so be it.

482
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,810
I will gladly do so.

483
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,280
 As the physician of the heart,

484
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,850
 I will let So Cheon heal her own illness.

485
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,670
 So you should also trust...

486
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,690
 could you try trusting yourself?

487
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,930
There.

488
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:13,490
If you keep taking them like that, will there be any left?

489
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,760
How can I hold myself back after smelling the oil?

490
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,230
Whoa, even straw shoes are delicious when you fry them in oil. Crispy.

491
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,010
Looks like you would even eat straw shoes.

492
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,370
Here!

493
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,370
Sure. Let's just eat straw shoes instead.

494
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,280
In any case, why is Physician Yoo asking us to prepare a feast early this morning?

495
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,700
Aigoo, I do not know.

496
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:52,440
He has been talking to Lady Eun Woo about this and that since earlier.

497
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,320
I found Bullshit Gye's treasure!

498
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,370
It is ginseng liquor.

499
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:24,260
Bullshit Gye has been storing it for at least 30 years.

500
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,780
Those girls.

501
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,890
It bothers me so much how they're nosily going around here and there.

502
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,500
Also that... Who was it?

503
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,240
Who was it?  T-The one who was such an eyesore?

504
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,100
Inspector! The inspector.

505
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,000
He followed Her Highness and made a ruckus while inspecting.

506
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,650
Is that something a man should do?

507
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,590
- Am I right or not? 
 - You are right.

508
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,260
- Am I right or not? 
 - Yes, yes.

509
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,110
Are you talking about me?

510
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,220
How much did you hear?

511
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,280
Anyhow,

512
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,990
I heard you have to reinvestigate the case.

513
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,530
It is only for formality.

514
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,900
Well.

515
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,820
Sir, a letter came to you.

516
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,490

517
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:41,380
"The blue one glanced at Young Master Lee over the fence and..."

518
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,960
Who are you people?

519
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,320
Are you, perhaps, the renowned orator, Sir Choi?

520
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,550
This is all for you, Sir.

521
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,780
T-Thank you very much.

522
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,300
Aigoo, the pleasure is mine.

523
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,900
So I was wondering, could you please do me a favor?

524
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,720
Jang Goon!

525
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,210
Ip Boon!

526
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,600
Where did everyone go?

527
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,940
Make way!

528
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,080
Move aside.

529
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,490
You! Move.

530
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,870
Now!

531
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,530
Court Lady Jung?

532
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,900
Please take these.

533
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,440
Thank you.

534
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,210
What is taking so long? Hurry up and start!

535
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,640
One second, please.

536
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,210
Today's book is

537
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:33,680
the bestseller that is almost impossible to get your hands on even in Hanyang,

538
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,150
"So Cheon's Farewell Song."

539
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,880
Today, I have the

540
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,580
new extra edition of

541
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,700
"So Cheon's Farewell Song."

542
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,300
Aigoo, t-that is a sales tactic, isn't it?

543
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,520
- I see. 
 - Obviously.

544
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,930
About to read it and stopping...

545
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,270
- Aigoo, I cannot stand it! 
 - Aigoo, it's true, true.

546
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,070
Let's just pay the money and hear it quickly.

547
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,330
- Here, here, here. 
 - Aigoo.

548
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,730
- Pay up! Pay, pay, pay. 
 - Pay, pay.

549
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,890
- Here you go! 
 - Aigoo.

550
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,290
I do not feel like reading alone today.

551
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,750
Is there a lady who can read here by chance?

552
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,490
Aigoo, we come to an orator because we do not know how to read.

553
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,730
What are you saying?

554
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,420
People who know how to read

555
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,690
- do not come to this place. 
 - That is right!

556
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,380
Me!

557
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,180
Sit. Sit down.

558
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,930
Sit down, please.

559
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,130
Is there no one?

560
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,150
That is too bad.

561
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,720
To the lady who reads with me today

562
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,050
I will give half of this here!

563
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,900
Oh, my! How much is that?

564
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,510
- Whoa... 
 - How unfortunate.

565
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,920
There is someone here!

566
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,600
Our Jeong Soon knows how to read.

567
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,160
Hey, then we will greet you with a round of applause!

568
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,320
Let's go, let's go!

569
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,550
You can read to us from here.

570
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,210
Gosh, hurry up and start reading! So frustrating!

571
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,570
Even today!

572
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,450
The woman with a red dot under her eye,

573
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:43,530
with one hand covering her nose,

574
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,660
came to me and said...

575
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,840
"If I had to live looking as hideous as you..."

576
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,960
  If I had to live looking as hideous as you,

577
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,390
 I would have thrown myself into that river already.

578
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,000
 Why are you still like this?

579
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,050
 Gosh, this ugly brat.

580
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,950
 Hey, look at her face.

581
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,280
 She is so ugly.

582
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,760
 - So hideous. 
 - Just step on her.

583
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,790
 Daebak. Hey, look at this! How ridiculous!

584
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,350
 Let me see.

585
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,060
 Catch it, catch it!

586
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,570
 Here.

587
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,890
 Where do you think you're going?

588
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,600
 Don't do this.

589
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,980
 I'm begging you. Please?

590
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,630
This book is

591
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,620
the most precious thing to me.

592
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,990
It is no different from myself.

593
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,030
"This book is no different from yourself?"

594
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,980
"Then..."

595
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,900
 Catch it, catch it!

596
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,070
 Give it back!

597
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,280
 Here, here, here!

598
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,010
 No, I'm sorry!

599
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,340
 This book is no different from yourself?

600
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,040
 Then it needs a wash.

601
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,400
 No!

602
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,000
 No! No.

603
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,100
 My novel! No!

604
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,820
 Hey, look at her.

605
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,600
 My book.

606
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,510
 Help me.

607
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,760
 Look, she is...

608
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,150
Save me!

609
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,800
Save me. Save me!

610
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,390
Please save me!

611
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,590
That is a beast in a human's guise!

612
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,670
Even a divine punishment is not enough for you!

613
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,460
You evil bitch!

614
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,630
That... That...

615
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,530
That wench!

616
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,680
Let heaven punish you!

617
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,190
You wretch!

618
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,340
It is because your reading is good.

619
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,190
Don't worry.

620
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,070
Okay, okay. Everyone calm down.

621
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,880
A novel is just a novel.

622
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,420
Come on! It was just getting to the good part.

623
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,460
Why did you cut off again?

624
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,980
You collected money just now!

625
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,360
If you are an orator, you should think about how to read it more entertainingly.

626
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,120
That is exactly it!

627
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,650
There is a more entertaining way to read it.

628
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,790
What are you doing then?

629
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,300
Who wants to join me?

630
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,800
- Over here. 
 - Me, me!

631
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,990
- Here, here! 
 - Over here!

632
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,500
Okay, okay, okay.

633
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,280
Here, here.

634
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,700
How about reenacting the scene from the novel exactly?

635
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,120
Yes! That is great!

636
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,160
All right.

637
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,650
After this

638
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,420
it will be over.

639
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,520
 Fill them up.

640
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,700
 Hey, what do you think you are doing?

641
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,870
 Why are you doing this? Don't do this, please.

642
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,070
 - I was wrong. 
 - Hey, sprinkle it on her.

643
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,560
 N-No.

644
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,090
 - Be pretty! 
 - Be clean!

645
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,770
 It suits you well! So well!

646
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,240
 Please stop.

647
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,560
 How nice.

648
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,870
 Oh no.

649
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,490
 Please stop.

650
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,610
You are the only one left now.

651
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,290
Be punished by the heavens!

652
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:58,220
You are all beasts in a human guise!

653
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:00,760
I was not the one who did it!

654
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,490
It's all a lie! A lie!

655
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,150
What's the matter?

656
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,870
It is only a story from a novel.

657
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:38,640
 Including me, all of us will help you.

658
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,950
 We will be by your side.

659
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,550
 So you should also trust us...

660
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,380
 No...

661
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,280
 could you try trusting yourself?

662
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,920
This is not a novel.

663
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,380
It is something that really happened.

664
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,990
W-What did she just say?

665
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,270
I did not try to kill myself.

666
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:41,720
Jeong Soon,

667
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,740
pushed me into the river.

668
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,140
How could she?

669
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,640
She is lying.

670
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,660
You said you were the one who found the suicide note in the morning, right?

671
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,970
 I took it to the municipal office building.

672
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,360
 That morning, after So Cheon left the paper mill like that,

673
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,890
 I saw it was left on So Cheon's seat.

674
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:17,890
The municipal office said you brought in the suicide note in the evening.

675
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:22,190
You probably waited until So Cheon was found in the river,

676
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,950
because you had a job to do in the meantime.

677
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,070
You cut off a part of a book So Cheon had transcribed

678
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,330
and made it look like a suicide note.

679
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,690
Your Highness, you did a huge thing!

680
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,220
Hey, take her away, right away.

681
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,920
It is all a misunderstanding!

682
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,150
I'm innocent!

683
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,280
Take her away.

684
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,670
 It's okay.

685
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,930
 It's okay.

686
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,330
 I'm sorry.

687
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,850
It's okay.

688
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,580
Everything is okay now.

689
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,500

690
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,800
You call this a treatment?

691
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,050
If no one harasses her anymore,

692
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,710
So Cheon will get better.

693
00:54:55,710 --> 00:55:00,050
Anything can be a method if it can treat a patient's illness.

694
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,150
That is my prescription and treatment.

695
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,460
Does this also violate the regulations?

696
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,210
Hey, Froggy.

697
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,520
You are wondering what other faults you can find now, huh?

698
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,070
Have you ever been sincerely thanked by a patient?

699
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,140
How is it?

700
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,280
It is quite broad outside the well, isn't it?

701
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,900
You!

702
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,060
Let's go eat.

703
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,850
Let us go.

704
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,650
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

705
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,920
Aigoo, I didn't do much.

706
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,510
Let's go!

707
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,240
We got the message to hurry up and return to Hanyang.

708
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,650
- "Who wants to join me?"
 - Me! Me!

709
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,530
How splendid, seriously.

710
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,880
Your face looks different.

711
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,810
Young Lady, watch your steps there.

712
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,570
Gosh, you were brilliant.

713
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,260
What is this?

714
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,780
Jang Goon always... always likes Lady Eun Woo.

715
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:29,290
Yes. I also like Lady Eun Woo, Jang Goon.

716
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,870

717
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,480
I know what a foolish thing you did

718
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,440
because I have been informed already.

719
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,040
This is not the end.

720
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,060
It is fine. I did not expect much anyway.

721
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,740
Your Lordship, with everything I have,

722
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,080
I will make sure that Yoo Se Yeop will never be able to return.

723
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,010
Even if an abandoned dog goes out and bites a person,

724
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,990
that is none of my business.

725
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:06,380
However, if it brings me the spoils of a hunt,

726
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:11,700
then I might be able to have it tied in the yard.

727
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,310

728
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,990
So Cheon!

729
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,860
Lady Eun Woo!

730
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:38,510
Let's go.

731
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,720
Do you know how long I waited?

732
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,550
You think this is only for you, huh?

733
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:48,710
I am sorry. Transcribing took some time.

734
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,330
Only four books?

735
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,120
- Court Lady Jung. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

736
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,830
How many people did you say are willing to transcribe?

737
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,830
Since Your Highness will be paying them handsomely,

738
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:19,380
everyone is dying to get the job.

739
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,680
Soon, eight volumes of "So Cheon's Farewell Song"

740
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,790
will be spread far and wide, all over Joseon.

741
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,160
That will not be enough.

742
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,570
We need to make the ninth and the 10th volume spread as well.

743
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,580
Pardon? They didn't even come out yet.

744
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,090
That is why you need to hurry up and write quickly.

745
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,940
I will find you as many transcribers as you need.

746
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,080
Yes, Your Highness.

747
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,210
I will be forever thankful for your grace.

748
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,870
Aigoo, this is so frustrating.

749
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,870
Hey, hey. I will just do it. Aigoo!

750
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,100
You need to hurry up.

751
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,960
Hey, it's rice!

752
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,440

753
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,490
How come no one grabbed me?

754
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:14,080
I guess this is the Royal Family's dignity.

755
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,310
It is so shiny, lighting up the place.

756
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:20,660
Physician Gye, you must be really proud.

757
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,620
A little.

758
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:26,370
I need to make some clothes with that silk.

759
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:27,650
Granny, I will make you some clothes.

760
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,180
Come on.

761
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,580
Do not get ahead of yourself.

762
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,870
All of that silk will be traded for medicinal ingredients.

763
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,650
Gosh, why?

764
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,520
They are celebrating without me when it is all thanks to me.

765
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,910
What is this? Is she not a widow?

766
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,390
But why is she acting like that?

767
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,310
What do you think their relationship is, Court Lady Jung?

768
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:01,140
I am not sure.

769
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,220
The way they look at each other

770
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,770
is like people in love.

771
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,700

772
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,540
I also went through much pain over the last year.

773
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,990
Because I missed someone.

774
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,050
You said you would personally read me the novel

775
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,950
that consoled your feelings in your voice.

776
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:23,940
So I did not read a single book and waited patiently.

777
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,050
Should I read from the first volume?

778
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:33,830
Of course. Please take your time and read me everything.

779
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,430
There are seven more volumes,

780
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,580
but the day is quite short.

781
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,650
What is the problem? When we have so many days.

782
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:45,740
If you read to me every evening,

783
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,550
that would be lovely.

784
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:00,160
You might be a bit embarrassed.

785
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,120
What makes you say that?

786
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,040
There is a character

787
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,780
with the same name as you.

788
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,220
And?

789
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,640
It is

790
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:16,290
the ultimate collection of romance.

791
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:19,740
It is a heart-fluttering romance novel.

792
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,670
I like that even better.

793
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,370
Then, please start reading.

794
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,760
Okay.

795
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:45,460
♫  Your sweet words  ♫

796
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:50,980
♫  Your gaze makes my heart flutter  ♫

797
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:56,400
♫  I finally realize now  ♫

798
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,750
♫  It feels like a dream, but I miss you  ♫

799
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:10,870
♫  You don't have to hurt anymore  ♫

800
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:18,210
♫  If we can start over again  ♫

801
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:28,190
♫  I will take the first step toward you  ♫

802
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,500
She came again. I seriously want to kick you.

803
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,790
What? What are you muttering?

804
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:41,360
I said a series of new doors are awaiting you.

805
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,080
What are you doing about the regulations of the town as the governor?

806
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,520
P-Pardon? What did you just...

807
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,640
A widow is carelessly going around as she wishes!

808
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,090
As long as I am here,

809
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:56,330
you will have to strictly enforce the regulations!

810
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:00,270
Yes, I absolutely agree–

811
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:32,250
Why?

812
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,700
Your Highness!

813
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,780
Your Highness!

814
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,500
Lady Eun Woo is not here.

815
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,370
Court Lady Jung took her earlier.

816
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:52,510
Court Lady Jung did? To where?

817
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,730
I don't know!

818
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,910
What do you need at this late hour?

819
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,940
You know we have business to settle, right?

820
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:13,290
What business do I have with you, Your Highness?

821
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,060
The promise you made back then. I will tell you now.

822
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,550
The promise?

823
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,320
 Make a promise to me.

824
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:31,550
Very well.

825
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,930
What is it that you want?

826
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,770
What I want

827
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,890
is his heart.

828
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,570
Yoo Se Yeop... I mean...

829
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,670
Yoo Se Poong's heart.

830
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:54,070
Give me his heart.

831
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:25,660
♫  Where have you gone  ♫ 
 ♫  With your warm gaze for me?  ♫

01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:29,310
 Do you think the Princess suffers from an illness of the heart?

833
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,090
 Strangely excessive anger.

834
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:35,520
 She could not be breaking down doors every time unless she is insane.

835
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,190
 I came to protect Her Highness!

836
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,750
 How can I marry such a scumbag.

837
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,160
 I am not ill.

838
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,380
 She has been using me thus far.

839
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,440
 I think I will need to prepare a special training.

840
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,600
 Is everyone ready?

841
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,290
 I am ready.

842
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:53,800
 All ready!

843
01:06:53,800 --> 01:07:00,700
♫  I will take the first step toward you  ♫
