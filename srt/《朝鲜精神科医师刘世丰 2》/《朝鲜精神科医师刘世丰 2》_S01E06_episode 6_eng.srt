1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,630

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,500

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,230

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,110

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,070

6
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,010

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,630

8
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,970
- Aigoo. 
 - There, there.

9
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,480
Wait, what?

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,440
What happened to him?

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,250
Is he someone you know?

12
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,830
He was unconscious on the mountain trail,

13
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,760
so I brought him to you right away.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,090
What? He should have gone to Hanyang a long time ago.

15
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,870
Why is he passed out here?

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,260
It looks like he rolled down the path. His pulse is weak from losing too much blood.

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,780
For now, move him to the room.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,940
Let us look at his wounds first.

19
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,790
Okay.

20
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,400
Why would he have come back here?

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,410
The Royal Clinic probably tossed him out.

22
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,510
He was sent to mess with us, but he returned with losses instead.

23
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,780
Would they have let him be?

24
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,790
Does that mean this was ill-intended?

25
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,050
Young Lady, as for those froggies at the Royal Clinic,

26
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,300
they become useless when they get kicked out of their well.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,470
They are probably not that wicked.

28
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,070
Even if that is true, why would he come here?

29
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,620
Aigoo, I don't know and don't care.

30
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,080
Anyhow, once this guy wakes up,

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,950
I am going to make sure he pays for the cost of

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,850
what he ate and pooped, as well as the treatment.

33
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,780
Why even what he pooped? So dirty.

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,820
For the crime of being so annoying and distasteful.

35
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,870
 You cannot! How can we accept him?

36
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,130
There are many patients at the clinic.

37
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,920
With one more physician, there will be less waiting.

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,470
Jang Goon, I thought you had a good memory.

39
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,380
Did you forget how he harassed us, giving us so much trouble?

40
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,200
Come on. He still looks manly and handsome.

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,840
He looks like he will work hard, too.

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,650
Granny, you and I have opposite tastes in men.

43
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,300
We don't have enough room at the meal table!

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,600
That is true.

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,140
I think he will eat a filthy lot

46
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,590
and also show off a filthy lot.

47
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,950
I absolutely cannot accept him.

48
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,640
- What is your opinion, Young Lady? 
 - What? Well,

49
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,280
I am not sure, but why bother?

50
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,860
He is a patient who came to the clinic.

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,400
It will not be too late to send him out after he gets better.

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,170
All right, everyone, go to sleep now.

53
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,360
Aren't we going to open tomorrow?

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,290
What— You don't have money?

55
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,940
You used to be a Royal Clinic physician,

56
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,350
so how can you not have even a penny?

57
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,220
Did you come to freeload on purpose, looking like a beggar?

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,830
I could not bring anything because I was in such a rush to leave.

59
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,270
His wound is too severe for him to go to a different clinic right now.

60
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,910
Gosh, I should not have taken him in!

61
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,270
I should have thought of how damn wicked you've been and

62
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,870
just toss you over to another quack, whether you live or die.

63
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,270
Hey, on top of the treatment fee from yesterday and today,

64
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,850
and food and lodging, it will be

65
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,640
100 nyang from now on! Okay?

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,510
That is too much.

67
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,330
How is that too much?

68
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,770
This guy should be charged for emergency care as well!

69
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,380
Okay, well. I will do anything to pay you back.

70
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,740
Thank you for the food.

71
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,800
What is this? Where did that arrogant inspector go?

72
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,650
Aigoo, he eats really well.

73
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,800
 Come out here, all of you!

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,880
Move. Move aside.

75
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,810
Move.

76
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,410
You go and stay inside.

77
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,600
Why? There is still a lot to do.

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,860
- Gosh, no questions. Hurry up now! 
 - Wait.

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,910
Aigoo, look at this father of mine.

80
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,790
Aigoo, what brings you to our clinic, Governor?

81
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,000
Because the village atmosphere is disorderly,

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,670
I am personally making roundabouts!

83
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,400
Hey-ho!

84
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,700
As you can see, our clinic only has patients.

85
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,180
Exactly.

86
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,370
A clinic should only be treating patients,

87
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,350
but it keeps getting on my nerves for some reason!

88
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,870
How long have you run this clinic here?

89
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,660
Well, it has not been that long.

90
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,030
A-About 10 years—

91
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,830
What do you mean 10 years?

92
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,710
Even Ip Boon is already old enough...

93
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,510
to...

94
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,570
Oh, what I mean is...

95
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,480
I-It has...

96
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,250
b-been about 10 years.

97
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,560
You are so familiar.

98
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,120
It feels as if I have seen your face somewhere.

99
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,860
Do you

100
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,370
know me by any chance?

101
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,650
A-Aigoo, how could I know you, Sir Governor?

102
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,590
I have never seen you before.

103
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,220
Physician Gye was born and raised in Sorak County.

104
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,200
- There is no way for him to know you. 
 - Oh, that is right.

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,780
I-Is this the right one?

106
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,220
- Oh, yes. 
 - Oh.

107
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,850
What are you doing here in that getup, Inspector?

108
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,160
Aigoo, a person shines only when they wear court attire.

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,570
Since you are dressed like that, you look so measly—

110
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,690
Hey, you!

111
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,810
Do you know how many doors of the municipal office building were broken because of you?

112
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,220
Mind your behavior, all right?

113
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,060
All of you! Mind your behavior, all right?

114
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,500
I am going. Do not come out! I feel pressured.

115
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,770
There, there. Whoa!

116
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,520
What an eyesore.

117
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,260
 You are so familiar.

118
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,580
 Do you know me by any chance?

119
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,620
Rotten bastard.

120
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,240
You cannot!

121
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,000
Although it is an expensive medicinal herb,

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,880
for Madam's current symptom of a long-lasting fever,

123
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,580
ginseng is not good for it.

124
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,210
If your temperature rises, you will get dizzy.

125
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,770
I said I would pay you handsomely,

126
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,240
so why are you being so difficult?

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,680
Should all of my family transfer to Birchwood Clinic?

128
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,690
A-Aigoo, this idiot— No,

129
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,310
what this physician is saying

130
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,670
is we should first use a medicine to lower Madam's fever

131
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,890
and then proceed to use ginseng

132
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,390
for her benefit, you see.

133
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,060
Here.

134
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,000
This is ginseng powder, made from the best of this year's six-years-old ginseng,

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,570
dried and ground, so you can consume it conveniently.

136
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,900
This physician is very good.

137
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,720
Thank you.

138
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,820
Well, I will be expecting you to be coming back.

139
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,860
- Please take care. 
 - Please take care!

140
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,910
Prescribing as you please without even checking her pulse.

141
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,020
What do you think you are doing?

142
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,690
It is not ginseng.

143
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,870
It is powdered Atractylodes roots, which are good for the stomach.

144
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,980
It's about believing what you want to believe.

145
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,630
Are you saying you fooled the patient?

146
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,290
Without even providing proper medicine?

147
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,720
Is there a need to confront needlessly?

148
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,660
It is better to see one more patient instead of arguing and wasting time.

149
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,340
All right, thank you for waiting.

150
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,170
That is right.

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,140
No, what I mean is...

152
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,870
I don't know what ulterior motive you have in coming back.

153
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,640
I had nowhere to go after leaving the Royal Clinic.

154
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,770
We are all uncomfortable with you, Physician Jeon.

155
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,100
I only did my best as an inspector according to the orders.

156
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,520
However, your feelings of contempt for me. Yes, it's a given.

157
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,980
As soon as your body recovers, please take your leave.

158
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,200
They say misfortunes do not come alone.

159
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Misfortunes indeed come in a series.

160
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,740
I am also uncomfortable.

161
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,640
So please do not worry.

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,460
I will leave soon.

163
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,750
 There.

164
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,470
 I heard the Left State Minister

165
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,380
 came to visit Your Excellency again, his paternal uncle.

166
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,170
 Were you...

167
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,130
 Were you able to talk to him about this humble servant of yours?

168
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,380
 I will try and put in a word next time.

169
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,260
 However,

170
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:29,430
 what use would these kinds of riches have for me at this age?

171
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,980
 Wealth and honor also pass with your youth.

172
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,240
 I will be leaving for Hanyang soon.

173
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,550
 And my greatest worry is that

174
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,060
 I might die alone, full of loneliness.

175
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,530
 By chance, do you have an illegitimate daughter at home?

176
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,590
Aigoo! Greedy old geezer.

177
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,720
I mean, the government throws a feast for you when you are over 70 years old.

178
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,640
Why did he say he was worried about dying alone?

179
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,160
Are you acting like you do not know, or do you really not know?

180
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,420
Is he an idiot or something?

181
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,010
What now? What is it?

182
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,230
He is saying he wants a concubine.

183
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,900
A concubine?

184
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,190
Aigoo!

185
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,340
Right.

186
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,740
If I get one of my family's women to be his concubine

187
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,120
we become in-laws with the Left State Minister.

188
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,340
Then my future will be full of victories!

189
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,220
You first need to have a young girl in your family.

190
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,270
You are quite the sharp guy.

191
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,680
That is true.

192
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,510
My family is full of men.

193
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,170
Geez!

194
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,340
 - You cannot do that. 
 - Father, just let go.

195
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,130
Aigoo, come on and look at this! Geez!

196
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,830
It is because you ate too much.

197
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,770
- Why does that matter? 
 - Come here!

198
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,710
- Gosh. 
 - Gosh.

199
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,510
 Gosh, so stinky.

200
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,270
 Jang Kyung Sook was hiding here, huh?

201
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,340
 - She died, huh? 
 - W-Who are you?

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
I knew it.

203
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,770
He seemed familiar for a reason.

204
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,880
All right, that's it.

205
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,000
Physician Gye,

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,700
the governor is asking you to come to the municipal office building.

207
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,780
Why is he telling me to come and go when I'm so busy?

208
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,060
I will go instead.

209
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,320
No, he's asking for you, Physician Gye.

210
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,290
He asked for me specifically?

211
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,870
Why?

212
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,790
You better sit tight and stay home. Got it?

213
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,840
Lead the way.

214
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,790
Your pulse is good, and your complexion is good, too.

215
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,080
What made you ask

216
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,900
for a house call when you are so healthy?

217
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,730
There is a reason for me to recall an old memory.

218
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,210
N-Natural Enhancing Memory Herbal Tea? Will that help me a little?

219
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,820
Why do you ask?

220
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,870
I remembered who you are.

221
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,750
You are quite skillful.

222
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,220
My memory got better without drinking Natural Enhancing Memory Herbal Tea.

223
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,730
Jang Kyung Sook.

224
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,490
The one wickedly involved with that bitch.

225
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,150
The physician who hid Jang Kyung Sook after she ran away.

226
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,670
I don't know what you are talking about at all.

227
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,080
You forgot Jang Kyung Sook?

228
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,370
Then, you remember the child you said was stillborn, right?

229
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,750
I am deeply sorry, but I forgot everything.

230
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,890
When living as a physician,

231
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,210
deaths of a mother and a baby during birth are common.

232
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,690
You mean you are pretending to have forgotten, not that you really forgot.

233
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,270
It is all in the past already.

234
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,750
Is that so?

235
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:48,000
However, if the child who was said to be stillborn is actually alive,

236
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,990
then that is not in the past.

237
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,370
Because that child clearly would be my niece.

238
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,210
 Not Ip Boon.

239
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,860
 I must protect this child. No matter what.

240
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,820
Aigoo!

241
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,560
I told you not to wander around outside!

242
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,940
Gosh, you will make me go deaf.

243
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,770
Have you been practicing voice lately or something?

244
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,690
Seeing how you are so full of vigor,

245
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,650
perhaps you should follow Court Lady Jung.

246
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,960
You...

247
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,340
You are grounded starting today!

248
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,610
That hurts!

249
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,680
Why do you keep telling me not to go outside?

250
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,780
Are you going to keep talking back to me?

251
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,660
Aigoo.

252
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,000
Physician Gye, what is the matter?

253
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,850
Let me go! This is between a father and a daughter.

254
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,560
You better not meddle.

255
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,950
- Aigoo, wait, wait a second. 
 - Aigoo!

256
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,890
- Wait— 
 - Move aside!

257
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,860
Ip Boon,

258
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,830
you better not leave the clinic.

259
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,550
If you cross this line,

260
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,110
I will kick you out right away.

261
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,580
After shaving your head bald!

262
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,650
Go back inside your room!

263
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,210
 No, you cannot!

264
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,290
 You cannot!

265
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,530
 No!

266
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,960
No!

267
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,670
No! Please don't!

268
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,610
Well,

269
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,720
arrowroot flower, sun-dried mandarin orange peel, and channeled water plantain.

270
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,250
Also...

271
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,000
Why did you come alone today, by the way?

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,160
Where did Jang Goon and everyone go?

273
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,560
Oh, this is for my father.

274
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,850
I am going to make him some medicine for hangovers.

275
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,880
Please give me only the best ones, even if they are costly.

276
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,860
Such a good daughter! Good daughter!

277
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,770
Okay, I will pack them up right away!

278
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,120
- Wait one second, okay? 
 - Yes, thank you.

279
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,710
Sure.

280
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,430
She is Gye Ji Han's daughter, isn't she?

281
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,750
- Aigoo, you are here, Ip Boon? 
 - No, she is not.

282
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,730
Just ask Physician Gye to buy you one.

283
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,780
Oh, I think she is.

284
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,070
It's a very nice fabric.

285
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,850
How much is it?

286
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,350
This.

287
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,950
She looks like her.

288
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,320
She looks oddly like her.

289
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,690
Ip Boon! It is done.

290
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,590
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

291
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,540
Aigoo.

292
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,970
- Okay, take care. 
 - Thank you.

293
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,360
 Do not say anything.

294
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,310
Aigoo, why does your father act so petty to you?

295
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,130
Not even letting his only daughter buy things like these.

296
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,100
 Do not say anything.

297
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,750
 Do not say anything.

298
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,870
Oh, right.

299
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,610
We have silk confiscated from thieves at the municipal office building.

300
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,960
Was it from the Qing Dynasty?

301
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
I heard it was the best of its kind, right?

302
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Huh?

303
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,690
- Do you want it? 
 -  Say no.

304
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,530
Sorry?

305
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,680
R-Really? I can?

306
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,780
Am I allowed to do that?

307
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,200
- Of course. 
 -  You better not!

308
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,420
I do not need it anyway.

309
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,890
Also, I do not have any daughters.

310
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,180
Aigoo.

311
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:25,040
By the way, you look just like your mom the more I look.

312
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,810
W-W-What was your mom's name again? It was...

313
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,110
Do you know my mom?

314
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,430
My mom is Jang Kyung Sook.

315
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,440
That is right. Jang Kyung Sook.

316
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,430
In fact, you and I are very closely related.

317
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,020
I am?

318
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,530
I am not sure if I should tell you this, but...

319
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,260
What do you say? Do you want to hear it?

320
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,510
Father, is what the Governor said true?

321
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,830
Ahn Ip Boon and Governor Ahn.

322
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,420
I heard my biological father is Governor Ahn's younger brother!

323
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,060
Is it also t-true that

324
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,230
you caused mom to die, Father?

325
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,070
You—

326
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,870
How can you just go and trust his words like that?

327
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,280
Why... Why do you not tell me?

328
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,760
How long were you going to hide it?

329
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,090
If his words are that trustworthy,

330
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,350
then start living at the municipal office building from now on!

331
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,800
It must be great since you will inherit the noble bloodline!

332
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,330
Go!

333
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,480
Non-alcohol drinkers may not enter.

334
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,580
Bringing alcohol when you cannot even drink?

335
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,460
I thought you would be scared alone.

336
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,420
Scared? Me?

337
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,510
I slept alone all my life.

338
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,500
What makes you say I would be scared alone?

339
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,870
Don't you have a nightmare every night these days?

340
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,960
Isn't this jehotang? 
  (A drink made of honey and various medicinal herbs, typically consumed by Korean nobility in summer)

341
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,890
It is not. You lack trust in people.

342
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,830
- You are going to drink, too? 
 - Yes.

343
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,490
I am going to try to see what is so great about it that you drink so much.

344
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,160
Whoa, really.

345
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,170
Did you really drink it all?

346
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,900
Were you acting like you could not drink all this time?

347
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,420
I mean, there is not much to alcohol, is there?

348
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,040
There.

349
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,250
- This one is the water for Physician Yoo. 
 - Water.

350
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,410
- This is the alcohol for Physician Gye. 
 - Alcohol.

351
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,240
- Water. 
 - Water.

352
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
- Alcohol. 
 - Alcohol.

353
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,260
You must get this absolutely right, Man Bok.

354
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,050
Of course. I don't know what Young Master will do when he gets drunk.

355
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,590
What does he do?

356
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,990
Aigoo, don't even mention it.

357
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,830
Whenever he drinks alcohol,

358
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,850
he becomes a different person.

359
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,600
He was shamming this whole time!

360
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,670
His face did not even change colors.

361
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,400
Give me some more alcohol— Oh, it is right here.

362
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,500
One second, please.

363
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,070
I will bring Young Master his alcohol separately.

364
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,590
No, I will just do it. Aigoo.

365
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,640
I will do it, please.

366
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,980
Which one was which again?

367
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't know.

368
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,130
The r-right...

369
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,220
Oh, l-left?

370
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,660
What is the terrible nightmare you're having?

371
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,620
I am not your patient.

372
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,540
Can you not talk about it and forget whatever it is?

373
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,670
You are the one who helped me to live.

374
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,990
There are pasts that cannot be treated that way.

375
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,070
When the past is the present,

376
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,320
those cannot be forgotten.

377
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,870
You need to just live on with it attached to you.

378
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,280
I am telling you to be honest.

379
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,700
Physician Gye, you are a coward.

380
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,550
A big coward.

381
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,910
This is terrible.

382
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,250
Everyone, be on your guard.

383
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,340
Aigoo, his face has become a fire pit!

384
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,060
There, there. I knew he could not drink that well.

385
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,620
Man Bok!

386
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,430
Bring some more alcohol!

387
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,250
He needs to drink every day.

388
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,510
His spirit is the most gallant in the world!

389
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,990
Poong!

390
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,920
Let's dance! Dance!

391
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,350
Dance!

392
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,780
My goodness, this guy.

393
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,950
The moon is really beautiful.

394
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,670
It is in front of my eyes.

395
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:20,250
The moon is really beautiful.

396
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,030
Should we not get them a room?

397
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,540
He is such a transparent person, right?

398
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,320
He is like a stream of water.

399
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,800
Hey, take care of Half-wit.

400
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,460
He said I could tell him everything, and he got himself drunk.

401
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,090
Physician  Gye, no!

402
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,580
- Physician  Gye, please sleep next to me. 
 - Whoa!

403
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,630
- Aigoo, why is he doing this? Let go! 
 - Please sleep next to me.

404
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,760
Let go!

405
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,280
Why the heck is this idiot doing this to me?

406
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,680
Just sleep next to him once!

407
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,000
He wishes for it that badly.

408
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,560
Oh, Young Lady.

409
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,820
Young Lady, why are you doing this?

410
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,130
- Young Lady, Young Lady! 
 - Please go!

411
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,200
Gosh, this little— Young Lady!

412
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,320
Young Lady, Young Lady!

413
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:23,710
 By the way, you look just like your mom the more I look.

414
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:01,520
I wonder what kind of people were Father and Mother.

415
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,340
I also killed her mother.

416
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,350
I killed her!

417
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,810
What are you doing there?

418
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,220
Did you have a nightmare again?

419
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,880
 You cannot! No!

420
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,770
 Please do not! Please.

421
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,410
 That baby is my daughter.

422
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,890
 This is your baby?

423
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,360
 What about Jang Kyung Sook's baby?

424
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,650
 I am sure Jang Kyung Sook also had a baby.

425
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,560
 Well, the thing is...

426
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,570
 H-Her baby was stillborn.

427
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,770
 I already buried her.

428
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,960
 Really?

429
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,790
 If you are lying, you will die.

430
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,710
 My family's bloodline belongs to my family until death.

431
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,780
 If you are hiding anything, in any case,

432
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,610
 I will follow you until the end, understood?

433
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,120
 Let's go.

434
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,500
You are here. You are here!

435
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,140
You are here?

436
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,700
Do you

437
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,210
also know what this is?

438
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,800
O-Oh, that... t-that is Jang Kyung Sook's hairpin.

439
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,960
That's right!

440
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,870
This is the decisive proof that you are Jang Kyung Sook's daughter.

441
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,400
Y-Your father gave it to her, probably—

442
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,700
No, certainly.

443
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,650
Really?

444
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,300
Of course!

445
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,400
You are definitely my niece.

446
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,910
You are not Gye Ip Boon.
  (Ip Boon sounds like "Pretty" in Korean. Gye Ip Boon sounds like "Freaking pretty")

447
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,840
You are Ahn Ip Boon.
  (Ahn Ip Boon sounds like "Not pretty")

448
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:47,280
So you are saying the fact that you are my uncle

449
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,140
is true?

450
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,150
I am going to feed you and dress you with riches.

451
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,300
I need to discuss this with my father first.

452
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,130
Where do you think you're going?

453
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,990
I said that bastard is fooling you!

454
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,390
I guess you're right.

455
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,060
You must be feeling unsettled and have a lot to wrap up.

456
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,680
But there were so many things I wanted to give you when I met you...

457
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,740
Do you want to take a look at the fine silk from the Qing Dynasty I talked about?

458
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:37,880
Look here! Show my niece every nook and cranny around here!

459
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,330
Are you awake?

460
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,860
I will tell you everything honestly now,

461
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,910
so come out here!

462
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,880
Move aside!

463
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,600
- There is something I need to check! 
 - What is this?

464
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,060
It's fine.

465
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,390
I know Ip Boon came here.

466
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,850
You lied to her, saying I caused her to die?

467
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,870
You are the one who killed her!

468
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,660
Now, how dare you falsely accuse me?

469
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,620
You are saying some ridiculous stuff first thing in the morning.

470
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,500
Ip Boon is my daughter!

471
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,710
She came here on her own feet.

472
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,300
But she is Jang Kyung Sook's daughter.

473
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,050
That means she is my family's bloodline.

474
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,890
Give Ip Boon back to me!

475
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,780
Ip Boon said she doesn't want to go.

476
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,920
Aigoo, a noble family's daughter spends her whole life in such a place.

477
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,360
Is that the best way for that child?

478
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,070
You need to marry her off now,

479
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,250
prepare dowry, and send servants to go with her.

480
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,200
There are so many things that will cost fortunes.

481
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,990
However, it seemed you could not even get her a silk dress.

482
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,640
Is running the clinic that difficult?

483
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:45,090
A stranger who doesn't share a drop of blood with her should leave now.

484
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,410
Oh, if...

485
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,910
If this is about losing a worker at the clinic,

486
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:55,130
then I will send you a slave from the government office.

487
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,470
So leave her to my rich and sound family now.

488
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,290
Aigoo, it is still too early.

489
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,270
Hey, take him out.

490
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,980
Dear niece?

491
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,940
I need to go home now. Let me go, please.

492
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,870
What are you saying?

493
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,570
Going back to that rundown place again?

494
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,720
I cannot allow that as your uncle.

495
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,720
Ahn Ip Boon, my dear niece,

496
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,760
I will let you live in a house in Hanyang that's like a palace.

497
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,180
No, I am going home.

498
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,270
I need to talk to Father.

499
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,540
 Father!

500
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,460
 Ip Boon!

501
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,740
 Aigoo. Stand up now.

502
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,450
 There, there. Let me see.

503
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,110
 My, you are okay.

504
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,260
 Are you okay?

505
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,950
 Yes, I am okay.

506
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:04,480
 Aigoo, my lovely darling!

507
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,050
 Aigoo, how lovely you are, Ip Boon!

508
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,610
 Father, happy birthday!

509
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,880
 Did you make these?

510
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,200
 Yes.

511
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,100
 You made such pretty ones.

512
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,080
 They also taste delicious.

513
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,430
 Do you want to try one, too? Here, here.

514
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,440
 There you go.

515
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,360
 There you go.

516
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,320
 There you go.

517
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,200
What did you say?

518
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,630
Ip Boon is that ugly governor's niece?

519
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,400
Oh, my.

520
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,420
She definitely takes after her mom's side.

521
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,270
Ip Boon was a noble?

522
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,200
I should have treated her well.

523
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,210
Did Ip Boon noona

524
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,350
go to a new home, then?

525
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,080
Is she

526
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,340
never coming back?

527
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,120
In just one moment...

528
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,150
Isn't it odd, though?

529
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,990
It is indeed quite suspicious.

530
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,600
He did not even show Ip Boon to you.

531
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,480
It is my fault.

532
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,240
Had I known,

533
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,350
I should have told her everything honestly.

534
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,840
Are you going to let her go to Governor Ahn like this?

535
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,410
She will only work to death if she stays with me.

536
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,330
I made her suffer all this time, too.

537
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,800
Still, you are the one who raised her so well so far.

538
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,670
Although Governor Ahn is a wicked man,

539
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,170
he might treat Ip Boon differently since she is blood-related.

540
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,840
If he will get her a good family to marry

541
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,440
and also let her study what she wants to learn...

542
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,770
Gosh!

543
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,360
We were not related by blood in the first place,

544
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,520
so she is now in her rightful place.

545
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,010
She is probably happier to leave me.

546
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,260
My.

547
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,730
Actually, by now,

548
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,420
she might be resenting me.

549
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,640
Physician Gye, big trouble!

550
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,820
Ip Boon will be

551
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,680
married off to an old man over 70 years old!

552
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,860
- Huh? 
 - What?

553
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,960
What in the world is this about now?

554
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,380
 Say, are you satisfied with her?

555
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,700
 Of course! I am more than satisfied.

556
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,990
 Let us set the date now!

557
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,500
 Yes, sure. But if you will promise one thing...

558
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,290
 No, it is only a thing of formality.

559
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,610
 It is absolutely not because I cannot trust you.

560
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,330
 One second, please.

561
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,420
 There.

562
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,300
 "Governor Ahn Hak Soo,

563
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,570
 in return for arranging a match for a concubine,

564
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,280
 I promise him a Sixth Senior Rank central government position."

565
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,910
 Just something like that, please.

566
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,160
 Sure, sure.

567
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,600

568
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,400

569
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,470
 Giving me such a young one,

570
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,070
 not even a widow,

571
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,920
 I fully understand how you feel.

572
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:35,940

573
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,840
 There.

574
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,610
 How is it?

575
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,070
 Fifth...

576
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,890
 Senior Rank?

577
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,750
What?

578
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,900
When else would we be able to add our name to a family as grand as this?

579
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,340

580
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,960
You need to strike the iron while it is hot.

581
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,790
I will need to send her off quickly before anything happens.

582
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,430
Let me go! Let go, you jerks!

583
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,670
Hey!

584
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,880
Father! Father!

585
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,660
Let go! Let go!

586
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,230
My, my.

587
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,190
Where is the wind coming from—

588
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,700
Someone—

589
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,820
Bullshit Gye.

590
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,920
If you return my daughter now,

591
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,820
you and I will both live.

592
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,410
If you hesitate and think of something stupid,

593
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,050
I will not end it here.

594
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,780
Since I have been acquainted the King already,

595
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,890
I will need to see the end of the bastard

596
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,660
who sold off someone else's daughter, no matter what.

597
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,500
You crazy man!

598
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,560
How dare you threaten the governor!

599
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,210
Hey—

600
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,520
Where is my Ip Boon?

601
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,950
I already sent her off on a palanquin to get married.

602
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,020
If, Heavens forbid,

603
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,460
my Ip Boon is not safe,

604
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,940
I will, without fail

605
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,660
cut your throat.

606
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,520
Physician Gye, what about Ip Boon?

607
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,560
She was sent off on a palanquin, so she is probably still nearby.

608
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,580
We need to bring her before she leaves Mount Sorak!

609
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,680
You stay behind. It's dangerous.

610
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,260
No, I will come as well.

611
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,350
I will be a big help.

612
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,190
Let me down! Let me down!

613
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,460
I said to let me down!

614
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,140
Hey!

615
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,920
We will rest here!

616
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,830
She is crazy loud for being the size of a sparrow!

617
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,960
You better stay put if you want to get a rice ball.

618
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,550
Let's go, if you are done eating!

619
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,330
I-I am still eating, though.

620
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,950
Geez!

621
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,980
What is that?

622
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,500
If you just give me the palanquin,

623
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,210
I will let you all go in one piece.

624
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,750
Who are you?

625
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,490
Her father.

626
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,610
How tear-jerking.

627
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,800
He said he is the father!

628
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,850
Do not waste your strengths.

629
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,480
Just give me the child!

630
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,470
I told you to move!

631
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,500
Get him!

632
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,610
What is this?

633
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,230
Is he your ally?

634
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:18,950
For a physician, you do carry all kinds of useless weapons, huh?

635
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,170
I am fine.

636
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:21,500
What is this?

637
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,960
What are you being so brave for?

638
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,170
Guys, let's have them go quietly.

639
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,790
One,

640
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,840
two,

641
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,150
three!

642
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,680
What is going on?

643
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,590
 You better stay put if you want to get a rice ball.

644
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,910
 She will peck it well since she is a sparrow.

645
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,820
I used... some croton fruits. 
  (Diarrhea causing medicinal herb)

646
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,200
Hey, you should have increased the dosage if you were going to use croton fruits.

647
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,720
We almost got in big trouble!

648
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,660
The dosage is very appropriate.

649
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,350
Their intestines will be wiped clean.

650
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,670
Let us go.

651
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,520
- Aigoo! 
 - This one let it go already!

652
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,040
Ip Boon!

653
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,600
Father? Father!

654
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,910
Father! Father!

655
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,910
It's okay.

656
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,160
Arrest them right now!

657
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:14,420
Sheath all your swords.

658
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,180
Did I not explain adequately earlier?

659
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:24,060
My daughter better be safe for your neck to stay intact.

660
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,550
She is not your daughter. She is my niece.

661
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,160
That, that one over there, belongs to my family!

662
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,880
Is my daughter some kind of object?

663
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,540
How dare you keep raising your voice

664
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,060
to the governor.

665
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,330
Take Ip Boon and go!

666
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,740
- Father. 
 - Hurry up and go!

667
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,200
Father!

668
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,170
We found the agreement!

669
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,560

670
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,590
You better stop there!

671
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,400
Attempting to sell off someone's daughter as a concubine in return for a government position.

672
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,060
Do you want to have the crime judged?

673
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,530
Am I not the one who makes the judgment?

674
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,010
Did you forget I am the governor of Sorak County?

675
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,220
The evidence of buying a government position,

676
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,820
abduction, and human trafficking.

677
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,720
It is here.

678
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,570
With this, your governor's position will be gone.

679
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,170
Since you wish to go to Hanyang that badly,

680
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,770
you can go and complain at the palace.

681
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:23,270
Hey! Y-Y-You are just as guilty as me.

682
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,310
She is Jang Kyung Sook's daughter, not yours!

683
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,590
During the trial, her relationship with my family will be exposed

684
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:32,500
and you will actually be guilty of abduction.

685
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,580
Do you want to go for it?

686
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,160
You better live innocently.

687
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,050
Otherwise, I will let His Majesty know.

688
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:50,060
You better don't show up in front of my daughter from now.

689
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,060
You fool.

690
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,390
Let's go.

691
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,960
- Father. 
 - I am okay. It is fine.

692
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,360
Why, you...

693
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,880
Good job, Ip Boon.

694
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,520
Everyone, thank you.

695
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,370
- Thank you so much. 
 - Sure.

696
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,090
Ip Boon noona must stay here.

697
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,510
Yes.

698
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:35,540
You properly experienced that all you do is suffer if you leave home.

699
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,050
This time I saved Ip Boon, at least.

700
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,410
From now on as well, I will

701
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:58,650
absolutely protect this child, so do not worry.

702
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,380
And don't worry about me, either.

703
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,180
 Father, what are you doing?

704
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,730
You must meet a very good man.

705
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,300
An old geezer like him is nonsense.

706
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,620
Should I meet someone like you, Father?

707
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:39,610
I fell for you a little, seeing how you were cherishing mom's wooden hairpin.

708
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:43,420
And I fell for you completely, seeing you swing your sword earlier.

709
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,460
No way, never!

710
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:52,010
I used to be a pathetic fool before.

711
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,560
Because I hated not being able to give her anything but a measly wooden hairpin,

712
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,460
I wanted to succeed

713
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,690
and stand proudly before your mother.

714
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:07,050
But when I came back she had already gone to another man.

715
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,640
You are the one who gave that to her?

716
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,990
Gosh, Governor Ahn said otherwise.

717
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,530
Geez, that bastard lied again.

718
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,000
That...

719
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,830
was handcrafted by me.

720
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,470
In that case, seeing how mom was cherishing it all this time,

721
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,090
she must have liked you a lot.

722
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,260
What is the point?

723
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,690
I could not do anything.

724
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:38,290
I failed to protect her.

725
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,420
However, Father,

726
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,050
thank you

727
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,190
for coming to get me.

728
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,320
For protecting me.

729
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,540
I chose you, Father.

730
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,630
Thank you, Father.

731
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,090
What brings you here at this late hour?

732
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:54,310
By the way, how did you come with Jeon Kang Il, Lady Eun Woo?

733
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:59,450
I happened to get some help from him.

734
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:04,410
It might be that I have misunderstood him.

735
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,480
 Royal Inspector, what are you doing here?

736
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,370
 I followed you because you were heading somewhere in the middle of the night.

737
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,560
 Even the clinic is chaotic at the moment,

738
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,590
 so what is going on?

739
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:26,090
 You know where Governor Ahn's office is, right?

740
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,140
 You are looking for an agreement?

741
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,410
 Yes, I heard it is a piece of paper.

742
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,980
 Physician Seo, are you not afraid?

743
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,830
 Of what?

744
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:46,390
 Making Governor Ahn and also the world your enemy,

745
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,330
 because you are going this far.

746
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,580
 Those things do not scare me.

747
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,830
 What really scares me is

748
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,900
 losing sight of myself.

749
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,660
 Men...

750
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:19,180
 especially when they wear court attire,

751
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:28,530
 always prepare a pocket for hiding a secret.

752
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,090
 Governor Ahn is no different.

753
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,090

754
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,740
Wait, wait!

755
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:14,270
So that means, in pitch-black darkness, you two...

756
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,300
by yourselves

757
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,270
found the agreement, huh?

758
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,570
Well, I...

759
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,690
I guess you can say that?

760
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,440
But Physician Yoo, you said you trusted me earlier,

761
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,360
saying you know my true feelings.

762
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,060
Of course, I absolutely trust your heart.

763
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,750
However, that man!

764
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,950
That inscrutable man who goes around with

765
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:46,610
a weird smile on his face all the time for some reason!

766
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,840
I do not know why he came back.

767
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,180
And he keeps oddly lingering around you. That former Royal Inspector!

768
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,380
- I don't like him. 
 - Sorry?

769
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,990
I don't like him!

770
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:03,410
I must tell Physician Gye to send him off tomorrow right away.

771
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,300
But then, you said this the previous day.

772
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,290
"He is a patient who came to the clinic.

773
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,920
It will not be too late to send him out after he gets better."

774
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,100
Exactly.

775
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,730
The treatment is over, and his limbs are fine.

776
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,700
We have done our duty as physicians.

777
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:39,170
The heart meridian.

778
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,490
How is it?

779
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,260
Your heart is calming down, is it not?

780
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,630
No.

781
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,870
It does not calm down at all.

782
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,370
Really?

783
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,700
-  Then the pericardium meridian— 
 - No, no, the—

784
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:12,210
♫  I secretly hid you deep in my heart  ♫

785
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:15,020
♫  In my foolishness, I kept my feelings from you  ♫

786
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,210
The heart meridian is good.

787
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:26,170
However, the heart meridian seems to have no effect.

788
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,940
Why?

789
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,940
Instead of calming my heart...

790
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,540
♫  Fluttering in the wind gently tearing my heart to pieces  ♫

791
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,900
Can you feel it?

792
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,670
As if I have an illness of the heart,

793
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:43,720
my heart pounds and pounds

794
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,090
like it is going to burst.

795
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,010
♫  Spending my days loving and missing you  ♫

796
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,500
It really is.

797
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,660
Your face also seems a little red.

798
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,390
Should I just try some acupuncture instead?

799
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,920
No.

800
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:09,750
♫  The very words "I love you", I've shouted from my heart hundreds of times  ♫

801
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,200
I think this will be enough.

802
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,760
♫  But I can't say aloud  ♫

803
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:21,050
♫  So I'll wait one more day  ♫

804
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,200
 Due to Physician Yoo Se Yeop's lewd behavior,

805
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,660
Sorak County's governor personally sent an appeal.

806
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,280
"Attempted to take a widow

807
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,560
who meant to stay loyal by offering to make her

808
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,610
a physician and pretending to be close to the Royal Family."

809
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,670
 Submit an appeal letter.

810
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:46,880
 A critical weakness that will make even His Majesty turn his back.

811
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,300
 Make an appeal that raises an issue regarding the violation of the Three Fundamental Bonds

812
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,010
  and Five Constant Virtues.

813
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,910
 In other words,

814
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:57,400
 you want to get rid of Yoo Se Yeop, that bastard, with one blow?

815
01:00:58,550 --> 01:00:59,840
 That's it.

816
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,550
 Moreover, you will be able to meet His Majesty, Governor.

817
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,410
 That is such a great idea.

818
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,690
 I will need to write it right now.

819
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:16,970

820
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:29,020
The entire Royal Clinic is bitter with anger after hearing this.

821
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:34,500
How can a person graced by your favor commit such a foul violation?

822
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,220
He could not have done it!

823
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,270
A person like him

824
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,420
cannot be allowed to stay as a physician.

825
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:47,440
Please order the voidance of all of Yoo Se Yeop's work!

826
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,100
 Please order the voidance!

827
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:59,700
 Please order the voidance!

828
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:15,650

829
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:28,130
♫  Spending my days loving and missing you  ♫

830
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:32,470
♫  The one thing that remains constant, the one I love is you  ♫

831
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:39,170
 Write down and report everything those wicked men and women do and say at the clinic.

832
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:43,000
 Right now at the Royal Court, there is a wildfire of the petition for the cancellation of

833
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,890
 all of Physician Yoo's works.

834
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:48,400
 Everything he has achieved so far will be made into nothing.

835
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,970
 There is not one suspicious thing regarding my relationship with Lady Eun Woo,

836
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:54,340
 so don't recklessly speak with that light mouth of yours.

837
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,370
 This time, you might have all your work cancelled

838
01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:00,090
 and lose everything because of me, Physician Yoo.

839
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,480
 Even if it means I will lose everything,

840
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,720
 I will never let go of you, Lady Eun Woo.

841
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:12,510
♫  The very words "I love you", I've shouted from my heart hundreds of times  ♫
