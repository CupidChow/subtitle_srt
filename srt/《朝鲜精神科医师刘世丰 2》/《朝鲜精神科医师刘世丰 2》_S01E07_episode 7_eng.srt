1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:09,950

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,300

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,020

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,080

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,360

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,050

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,340

8
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,660

9
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,600
Geez!

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,630
Gosh.

11
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,230
I need to seal the coffin.

12
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,630
For that, I need to find a decisive fault.

13
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,180
Dear Chil Sung, you need to do a job for me.

14
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,070
Oh, I'm already busy, but these two seem free.

15
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,170
What kind of...

16
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,320
What work...

17
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,090
Something that my dear Chil Sung will be very good at.

18
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,200
 I'm a police officer.

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,160
 Catching evil guys and protecting justice!

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,130
Write down and report everything those wicked men and women

21
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,640
do and say  at the clinic.

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,030
Especially focusing on lewd behaviors.

23
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,490
- Understood? 
 -  Justice, my ass.

24
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,790
 I'm just a cowardly officer

25
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,040
 spying on good people.

26
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,440
Chil Sung, looking at your complexion

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,300
you must have indigestion.

28
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,110
Lady Eun Woo will take care of that with acupuncture in no time.

29
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,650
So please come in.

30
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,770
No, wait.

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,660
Your lower bowel is cold, and your stomach is weak.

32
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,610
Chil Sung must be having worries and concerns, right?

33
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,640
Exactly.

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,730
What is it? What are you worried about?

35
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,180
Governor Ahn must be harassing you a lot.

36
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,150
Gosh, this Governor Ahn.

37
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,610
Then you can slack off here and just say you were getting treated.

38
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,660
How is my prescription, Physician Yoo?

39
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,710
I thought you read my mind.

40
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,710
It is the most appropriate prescription for Chil Sung.

41
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,000
Be at home and rest to your heart's content.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,980
By the way,

43
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,620
are you two always like this?

44
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,110
Feel at home.

45
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,800
 Lady Eun Woo, shall we go for a walk after work  today?

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,930
 Sure, Physician Yoo.

47
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,370
Aigoo,

48
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,800
are they not making it too obvious?

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,930
If some other police officer came here,

50
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,680
then they will be found out right away!

51
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,220
No, I am not doing it!

52
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,520
There, there.

53
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,630
This is a letter from His Majesty.

54
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,720
Just deliver it to Physician Yoo.

55
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,670
It was sent to you, Physician Gye.

56
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,150
 Right now at the Royal Court, there is a wildfire of a petition

57
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,510
  for the cancellation of all of Physician Yoo's works.

58
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,760
 According to an appeal from Sorak County's Governor,

59
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,230
 Se Yeop pretended to be close to the Royal Family

60
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,010
 to seduce a widow who was trying to be chaste.

61
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,600
 Even if he is innocent

62
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,420
 this foul rumor has become commonplace now,

63
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,860
-  which is a grave problem.  
 - Aigoo.

64
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,720
Ahn Hak Soo, this bastard.

65
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,300
 I will try my best to stop them,

66
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,400
 but it'll be best to not arm them with further ammunition.

67
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,470
 I still desperately need Physician Yoo Se Yeop.

68
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,210
 I'll protect him from here,

69
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,160
 so I ask you to protect him there.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,220
Gosh.

71
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,580
Cancellation of all his work?

72
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,760
 Physician Gye!

73
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,510
There is nothing wrong, is there?

74
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,570
No. N-Not yet...

75
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,280
Physician Gye, what does it mean that all of his work

76
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,380
can be canceled?

77
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,830
Everything he has achieved so far

78
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,680
will be made into nothing.

79
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,190
Ranking first in the Byeolsi Exam Liberal Arts, in the medical exam, and being the Top Acupuncturist.

80
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,910
He probably has way more achievements than other people,

81
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,640
but all of that will be crossed out altogether.

82
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,870
Is it something irreversible, then?

83
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,230
It will be difficult.

84
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:19,700
For now, he will not be able to enter the palace anymore.

85
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,060
Even if he is a friend of His Majesty,

86
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,000
there is no way to bring in someone whose work has been canceled.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,130
What do we do then?

88
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,990
If Physician Yoo really ends up like that...

89
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,530
It is just one appeal letter.

90
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,900
We need to stop it. That's all we need to do.

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,900
Aigoo, a bug.

92
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,710
Oh, Jang Goon.

93
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,760
What do you need?

94
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,040
Chil Sung, you!

95
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,030
Your face is all gloomy.

96
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,370
Do you have any worries?

97
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,690
He is just stuck in the middle, going back and forth here and there.

98
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,010
Poor thing.

99
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,990
That is why I made the extra spicy flaming chicken.

100
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,820
- Eat this and forget it all! 
 - Yes.

101
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,270
When you are worried about anything,

102
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,460
eating spicy stuff works best.

103
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,390
Exactly! It is a cure for illnesses of the heart.

104
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,710
Namhaedaek's flaming chicken is the best in the nation!

105
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,830
Come on. She's the best in everything she does!

106
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,630
Nice and spicy.

107
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,390
Take a leg. Here.

108
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,050
There.

109
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,870
Oh, please go ahead. I don't think I can eat.

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,390
Hey, don't worry.

111
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,280
Be faithful!

112
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,620
Do you think your superior will be your superior for life?

113
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,520
Even if that guy keeps getting replaced,

114
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,340
you will always be an officer of Sorak County.

115
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,080
How spicy.

116
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,260
So spicy.

117
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,110
Aigoo, come have some flaming chicken, Young Lady.

118
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,980
I am okay. I have no appetite.

119
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,340
- Young Lady. 
 - Here.

120
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,330
Is she sick or something?

121
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,210
It's so obvious what happened.

122
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,780
Governor Ahn sent an appeal letter as revenge,

123
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,480
because you foiled his plan with Ip Boon last time.

124
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,410
You will be in big trouble should you make one slip.

125
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,800
Is that so?

126
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,220
"Is that so?"

127
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,970
Wake up!

128
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,500
Nothing is more effective than attacking one's ethics in the Royal Court!

129
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,220
If things go wrong,

130
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,250
you won't be able to even work as a physician.

131
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,890
Why should I worry when their claims are not true?

132
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,730
All of this will resolve if I just explain myself.

133
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,300
Aigoo. This is the problem with you bookworms.

134
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,360
You have no idea about politics!

135
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,240
Breaking you down is not even a problem.

136
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,520
Branding you as a wretched philanderer who goes around seducing loyal widows,

137
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,790
it's so easy for those bastards!

138
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,490
And, even if you say you are okay with it,

139
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,720
what about Young Lady?

140
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
Are you not thinking about what Lady Eun Woo might go through?

141
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,810
Just as a safety measure, only look after the male patients for now.

142
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,300
Are you telling me to accept the shackles they threw at me?

143
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,590
Shackles are way better than a guillotine.

144
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,640
It is only for a while. Listen to me.

145
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,170
The Young Lady will only tend to female patients for the time being.

146
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh, and don't even go to house calls together.

147
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,250
What about acupuncture, then?

148
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,350
You can just go with that Froggy!

149
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,220
Always stay three feet away from the Young Lady.

150
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,000
Do not even walk beside each other.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,380
Don't give that bastard Governor Ahn any ammo, do you understand?

152
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,080
You are looking for this, right?

153
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,120
Oh, yes.

154
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,990
I thought I had lost it.

155
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,740
Thank you.

156
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,610
Physician Seo,

157
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,730
I know you are uneasy about Physician Yoo's matter.

158
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,560
How did you know, Physician Jeon?

159
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,000
I keep one ear open to the palace since I will be going back one day.

160
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,820
What do you think about staying away from this place for a while?

161
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,560
Such as Heuksando, where your father resides.

162
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,590
Rumors tend to be harsher toward women.

163
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,070
"A former Royal Physician philandered with a widow while living under the same roof."

164
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,390
It is perfect for people to gossip about.

165
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,990
We did not do anything that is wrong.

166
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,150
I know.

167
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,680
But from the people who were criticized and impeached by the Royal Court

168
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,440
following a public debate,

169
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,510
how many do you think truly committed wrongdoing?

170
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,400
Physician Jeon, are you saying that

171
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,960
you think Physician Yoo's works can be canceled even when he is not guilty?

172
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,020
No one knows.

173
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,610
The palace's matters are just like the weather.

174
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,560
It is wise to stay under the roof when there is a quick shower.

175
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,320
No.

176
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,810
I do not want to hide as if I really did something wrong.

177
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,200
I will not run away.

178
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,330
If you insist, distance yourself from Physician Yoo for a while.

179
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,620
If you do not, you will be suspected.

180
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,620
 Just as a safety measure, only look after the male patients for now.

181
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,910
 Always stay three feet away from the Young Lady.

182
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,560
 Don't give that bastard Governor Ahn any ammo.

183
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,500
It will be irreversible.

184
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,500
 Everything he has achieved so far will be made into nothing.

185
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,540
 Distance yourself from Physician Yoo for a while.

186
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,110
 If you do not, you will be suspected.

187
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,200
Where is Lady Eun Woo?

188
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,090
She prepared rice at dawn and went on a house call.

189
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,310
The Young Lady made rice?

190
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,950
It seemed she did not get any sleep.

191
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,150
I came outside at dawn, and she was still here at the time.

192
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,170
The handsome inspector physician went with her to the house call.

193
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,670
- Why would he go with her? 
 - What?

194
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,200
"It is still dark. Let me come with you."

195
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,140
That is what he said.

196
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,060
He must have followed her, since it was dark.

197
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,860
Does he think he is a lamp or something?

198
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,210
When he came down to inspect us last time,

199
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,510
to the Young Lady he was soft like the spring breeze.

200
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,430
You can just focus on your patients after eating, then.

201
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,050
So why the long face?

202
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,940
From now on, send female patients to the Young Lady,

203
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,330
and send male patients to him and me.

204
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,050
Don't even give medical records of female patients to him.

205
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,220
But why? What if we get too busy?

206
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,800
It's a matter of life and death for Half-wit! Do as I say, all of you.

207
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,300
Governor Ahn will be fiercely out and about to

208
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,980
find a fault in this guy and the Young Lady.

209
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,210
He is scheming something again!

210
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,760
Aigoo, aigoo. Your spit...

211
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,600
- Drink some rice water. 
 - Okay.

212
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,020
Physician Gye, Chil Sung is not able to eat anything.

213
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,090
Please diagnose him in detail.

214
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,610
No, I am okay.

215
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,300
Hey, you, Chil Sung!

216
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,600
Your mom solely relies on you.

217
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,410
So stop looking lethargic and get yourself together, you punk!

218
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,010
Yes.

219
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,640
Eat up.

220
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,430
Go on ahead and eat.

221
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,130
Welcome.

222
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,630
Please wait a moment.

223
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,660
You got a lot better than last time.

224
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,520
♫  Have you noticed the wind blowing?  ♫

225
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,870
Physician Yoo, please give me acupuncture quickly.

226
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,110
I think I will be in serious trouble soon.

227
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,770
Then, I will ask Physician Seo—

228
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,620
Please wait a little more. Physician Gye will be back soon.

229
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,720
- For now, I'll give you moxibustion. 
 - Okay.

230
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,700
♫  I'm happy even when it hurts  ♫

231
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:36,100
♫  Little by little, I can engrave you in my heart  ♫

232
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,960
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫

233
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,510
♫  This shouldn't be difficult  ♫

234
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,070
♫  There's one that I can't endure  ♫

235
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,560
♫  Only one thing I can't endure  ♫

236
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:01,300
♫  I wish and hope every night, when I open my eyes one day  ♫

237
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:11,100
♫  I want to embrace you as you are  ♫

238
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,520
Try to look happy, could you?

239
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,970
You were smiling ear to ear going to house calls with Physician Seo.

240
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,060
Your behavior is the reason why such appeals are being made.

241
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,990
I am innocent.

242
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,670
There is not one suspicious thing regarding my relationship with Lady Eun Woo,

243
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,680
so don't recklessly speak with that light mouth of yours.

244
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,290
I heard the Royal Court is already discussing whether to cancel your work or not.

245
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,470
And you are still as laid back as ever?

246
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,410
Either Physician Seo or you need to leave this place to resolve the issue.

247
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,980
No.

248
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,640
We will not run away.

249
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,080
You are saying the same thing.

250
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,800
You dared to tell Lady Eun Woo... to leave this place?

251
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,170
I just told her my humble opinion.

252
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,750
Anyone would think that way.

253
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,930
Stop pretending to be considerate.

254
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,390
If you try to meddle with my life and Lady Eun Woo's life,

255
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,970
I will not let you be.

256
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,070
Because you are the one who needs to leave.

257
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,080
Stop being emotional.

258
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,760
Let me ask you one thing in that case.

259
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,210
The ring on Physician Seo's finger, did you give it to her?

260
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,950
Before you claim your innocence, try to reflect on your behavior first, all right?

261
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,220
"Ate breakfast separately.

262
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,520
Went on house calls separately, too.

263
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,720
Did not even face each other.

264
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,530
Physician Yoo took male patients, and Physician Seo took female patients."

265
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,590
Whoa, how proper. Right, you idiot?

266
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,830
I thought you would get me some good motives, but I did not gain anything here!

267
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,330
Whose side are you on?

268
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,740
I told you to keep a watch on them, but you are defending them.

269
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,860
Whose side are you on, exactly?

270
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,040
Take the lead.

271
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,490
How dare he come in here?

272
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,420
I am sure I told you not to come around here!

273
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,110
All right, search the place.

274
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,560
What are you doing right now?

275
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,340
What?

276
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,080
What are you doing right now?

277
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,920
Collecting evidence.

278
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,970
I found it!

279
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,420
Look here, look here!

280
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,820
Not even 15 minutes passed, and I got some evidence.

281
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,250
Do I

282
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,500
have to make myself come like this!

283
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,860
Are you allowed to search for private letters like this?

284
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,260
I came personally to search for private letters like this.

285
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,280
While you are exchanging countless love letters like this,

286
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,810
those higher-ups are not taking it when I am spoon-feeding them.

287
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,040
Hand it over, please.

288
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,300
This is seized.

289
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,870
What are you doing right now?

290
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,720
You came just in time.

291
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,130
If I just submit these affectionate love letters as evidence,

292
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,040
your work will be canceled and you'll be doomed, right?

293
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,380
So why did you have to

294
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,150
choose to meet a widow and go through this?

295
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,200
Take all of these to the municipal office building.

296
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,690
We are not guilty of anything.

297
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,150
Even if you are a governor,

298
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,150
you cannot wrongfully take letters.

299
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,310
You should just hand it over.

300
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,710
Let me make an irrefutable offer.

301
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,750
W-What now? What is it again?

302
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,190
Your agreement from last time.

303
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,510
What do you say about burning that agreement

304
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,070
and these letters at the same time?

305
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,100
What are you saying?

306
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,760
How are one letter and one box of letters the same?

307
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,420
Because trafficking in a government position, abduction, and human trafficking

308
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,650
are all in that one letter.

309
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,370
I am not sure if its weight is the same as

310
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,320
a bunch of ordinary letters

311
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,780
that exchanged greetings from a far distance.

312
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,750
These letters are very private,

313
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,330
but they are just as innocent.

314
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,190
How about it?

315
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,310
- Well, if you refuse— 
 - Okay, okay. Let—

316
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,670
I will let you do that.

317
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,780

318
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,360
You got hurt because of Governor Ahn earlier, didn't you?

319
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,030
No, it is not.

320
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,410
It is nothing.

321
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,860
Lady Eun Woo.

322
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,720
I am worried,

323
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,330
because it seems the situation is worsening because of me.

324
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,280
How can you think that?

325
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,640
You saved my life, Lady Eun Woo.

326
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,110
No, I didn't.

327
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,160
This time, you might have all your work canceled

328
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,250
and lose everything because of me, Physician Yoo.

329
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,070
We shouldn't be sitting here.

330
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,620
Go to His Majesty.

331
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,730
Go to His Majesty and clarify the accusations.

332
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,780
Yes.

333
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,860
I will do that if need be.

334
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,680
However, Lady Eun Woo,

335
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,900
these things are nothing to me.

336
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,570
Since I can straighten them out.

337
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:51,510
I will stop it, so it doesn't become an ugly rumor.

338
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,050
Please do not worry.

339
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,490
Even still,

340
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,290
what if everything attached to

341
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,560
Yoo Se Yeop disappears?

342
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,680
In that case, I can just

343
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,730
keep on living as Yoo Se Poong like now.

344
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,280
What is there to worry about?

345
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,360
Dear Chil Sung,

346
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,840
I am going to give you one more opportunity.

347
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,300
There will be a prohibitory decree.

348
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,620
Keep a watch on them day and night starting today.

349
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,080
You should not sleep.

350
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,720
Should you?

351
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,810
"Women may not go outside after the Hour of Monkey.
 (T/N: 3:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m.)

352
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,560
If you must travel,

353
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,960
you must have a pass obtained from the government."

354
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,450
What? The sun is not even down at that time.

355
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,110
Have you gone mad, Orabeoni?

356
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,820
Seriously. Hey!

357
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,100
How are we going to make a living if we cannot go outside?

358
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,020
Aigoo, he is totally out of it.

359
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,550
Wake up!

360
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,380
"For the edification of customs, widows may only

361
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,570
make a living by doing sewing jobs

362
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,440
and making textiles until further notice.

363
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,400
Especially female physicians' carefree

364
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,080
house calls are prohibited."

365
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,940
Hey, this is just too obvious.

366
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,820
He is just trying hard to find a fault, isn't he?

367
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,520
Wait a minute. Could it be

368
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,660
that you got sick because Governor Ahn harassed you?

369
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,810
He did, definitely.

370
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,490
Things like this

371
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:23,620
must be torn apart like this in order for your sickness to be cured.

372
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,400
Physician Gye!

373
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,650
Yes, yes.

374
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,090
Please come with me right now!

375
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,950
O-Our young lady g-got injured.

376
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,660
The young lady of the house by the jujube tree?

377
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,750
Is she badly injured that she cannot even come to the clinic?

378
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,000
That's not it.

379
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,570
Because of the prohibitory decree...

380
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,260
Gosh, the Hour of Monkey passed.

381
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,850
- Damn. 
 - Seriously.

382
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,660
You are really not letting us go outside?

383
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,570
Geez, Governor Ahn, that crazy bastard.

384
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,830
Is he telling women to die in their own rooms if they get sick?

385
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,760
I will go myself. Just wait.

386
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,330
What nonsense.

387
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,840
Why am I like this?

388
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,810
Is something wrong?

389
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,060
Yes.

390
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,080
Take a seat here.

391
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,820
Physician Yoo, are these things treatable as well?

392
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,900
I cannot sleep a wink,

393
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,910
I lose hair by fistfuls,

394
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,620
and just now my heart was racing.

395
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,060
I could not breathe,

396
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,570
and started sweating.

397
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,710
And shamefully, I want to cry, too.

398
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,620
Physician Yoo, I am sorry.

399
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,320
I am sorry.

400
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,860
It is okay.

401
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,530
It is fine.

402
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,770
Working is not so easy, is it?

403
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,910
Yes.

404
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,800
You have to do what you don't want to do.

405
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,910
Yes.

406
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,000
You are right.

407
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,910
Usually, most people run away

408
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,130
when they have to do what they don't want to.

409
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,830
In that sense,

410
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,420
you are a very brave officer.

411
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,060
Me?

412
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,030
Is that true?

413
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,610
Of course!

414
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,950
What are you writing so diligently on your note?

415
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,730
- Could I take a look? 
 - No.

416
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,810
You can never look.

417
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,210
An officer needs...

418
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,100
 Whose side are you on?

419
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,530
 I told you to keep a watch on them, but you are defending them.

420
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,130
 Whose side are you on, exactly?

421
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,370
 to be brave and just, right?

422
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,560
However, I am timid and...

423
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,680
 Keep a watch on them day and night starting today.

424
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,780
 You should not sleep. Should you?

425
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,820
cowardly.

426
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,370
Anyone becomes timid

427
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,850
when something precious is at stake.

428
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,020
That is not an evil thing.

429
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,020
Thinking about it now,

430
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,800
I think I have just the right treatment for you.

431
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,280
What do you think? Would you like that treatment?

432
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,170
Is it expensive?

433
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Forget about everything else.

434
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,230
Just focus on your own emotions.

435
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:28,280
You just write down what you feel.

436
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,860
"During today's Hour of Monkey,

437
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,690
the wind was nice.

438
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,220
There were many clouds."

439
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,410
And then...

440
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,380
It feels a little awkward.

441
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,930
you just

442
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,040
look into yourself.

443
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,060
 However, I cannot help but miss you.

444
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,370
 Even when you're right in front of me.

445
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,290
What will you write today, Physician Yoo?

446
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,250

447
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,650
Me?

448
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,730
I would write...

449
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,600
 During today's Hour of Monkey,

450
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,870
 I missed Lady Eun Woo.

451
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,680
 I was curious whether she felt the same way or not.

452
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,400
 Since she can do just fine

453
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,180
 without me now,

454
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,910
 I am happy and afraid at the same time.

455
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,590

456
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,420
What is it that I should do?

457
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:27,750
Which path do I need to walk?

458
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,400
Aigoo, that hurts.

459
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,070
Well, of course, needles hurt.

460
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,100
Try walking now.

461
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,810
Oh, my goodness! It doesn't hurt!

462
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,020
It doesn't hurt at all!

463
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,350
Aigoo, you are really awesome, Physician Gye.

464
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,460
Why did you sprain your ankle at night? It's such a hassle.

465
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,350
Aigoo, I know.

466
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,550
I guess I'm getting old.

467
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,120
What made you come in person on a house call?

468
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,980
Where did your other cute physicians go?

469
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,790
It's that darn prohibition decree!

470
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,590
Are courtesans also prohibited from going outside after Hours of Monkey?

471
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,980
What prohibition?

472
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,530
Gosh, this is what I am saying!

473
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,600
That decree from Governor Ahn works just as he pleases.

474
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,630
He said all women are prohibited—

475
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,950
What? People badmouth even His Majesty in his absence.

476
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,940
He is not... "not here."

477
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,650
He is over there in the room across from here.

478
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,810
- Governor Ahn is? 
 - Yes.

479
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,020
I am anxious to death.

480
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,430
Please say something.

481
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,090
You must have had a reason to give me that advice.

482
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,350
If I get punished for slander by His Majesty,

483
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,050
do you think you will be safe, Inspector Physician?

484
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,820
So who told you to make such foolish additions to my draft of the appeal letter?

485
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,330
If you had only aimed at Yoo Se Yeop according to the draft, his work would be canceled

486
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,920
and you would be in the same boat as the Left State Minister already.

487
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,440
For an appeal letter to have power,

488
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,630
you need to get one man at a time.

489
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,390
When did I tell you to bring that female physician into this?

490
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,830
I was just trying to

491
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,460
put a final end to Yoo Se Yeop, that bastard.

492
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,450
I heard His Majesty ordered a thorough investigation.

493
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,290
So we will have to wait and see.

494
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,950
Since you already made a choice to spread a rumor,

495
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,350
you may as well spread another one that's foolproof.

496
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,010
Physician Yoo.

497
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,430
Lady Eun Woo.

498
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,640
I missed you.

499
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,620
We always share the same space.

500
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,850
How did I

501
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,540
not realize it all this time?

502
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,480
Treating together,

503
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,750
going on house calls together,

504
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,610
giving acupuncture in my place.

505
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,830
I had forgotten that every second of our time spent together

506
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,600
was so meaningful.

507
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,150
If we have to be so distanced from each other,

508
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,840
so...

509
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,070
you are no longer able to be my hands.

510
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,270
I think I will be stifled.

511
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,970
I hope

512
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,510
you feel the same way as me, Lady Eun Woo.

513
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,230
Even so,

514
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,290
we have to overcome this crisis.

515
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,600
We must do so.

516
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:48,040
♫  If I can send the feelings that seep out of my heart  ♫

517
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,540
♫  Spending my days loving and missing you  ♫

518
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,950
♫  The one thing that remains constant, the one I love is you  ♫

519
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,070
Even if it means I will lose everything,

520
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,240
♫  The very words "I love you"  ♫

521
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,510
I will never let go of you, Lady Eun Woo.

522
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,490
♫  I've shouted from my heart hundreds of times  ♫

523
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,810
♫  But I can't say aloud,  ♫

524
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:22,390
♫  so I'll wait one more day  ♫

525
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:44,900
Where have you been? The night is getting late.

526
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,110
What about you, Physician Gye?

527
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:51,800
Well, I was on a house call at Moohwagak.

528
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,120
Chun Wol had sprained her ankle.

529
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,880
This late at night?

530
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,060
Aigoo, I should have gone.

531
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,490
How many lives do you think you can save by raising a physician?

532
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,360
Well, that would depend on the physician's capabilities.

533
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,010
You think it would be nice to get to

534
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,610
a higher position after treating some higher-ups, right?

535
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:21,760
Well, that is what everyone at the Royal Clinic wants.

536
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,460
However,

537
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,500
try living a virtuous life by saving lives in urgent care.

538
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,120
You cannot ever quit that.

539
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,850
A physician is bound to save more lives

540
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,660
when they are in a rural place like this.

541
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,360
If you destroy a single rural clinic,

542
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,980
it is the same as killing all the people

543
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,330
that clinic could have saved.

544
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,910
Why are you saying that to me?

545
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,350
I heard

546
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,440
you are Yoo Se Yeop's colleague from the Royal Clinic.

547
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,960
You probably didn't meet with Governor Ahn

548
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,170
to investigate someone, you weren't even close to.

549
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:19,030
What are you trying to pull off here, exactly?

550
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,810
"Spread a rumor that's foolproof."

551
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,160
Damn it!

552
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,300
Coming into the governor's room like it is your own.

553
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,670
What now? W-W-What now, huh?

554
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,840
You are going to draw your sword, do this and that,

555
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,780
make me pass out by pressing me here? As a physician?

556
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,280
Do not meddle with my kids anymore.

557
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,060
You fabricate a romance between a man and a woman

558
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,160
and submit an appeal letter? How petty.

559
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,350
Oh, that?

560
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,370
It will resolve on its own if your subordinate physician is truly innocent.

561
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,620
No need for guilt.

562
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,210
Using Chil Sung to find a fault at any cost!

563
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,550
Ordering an unnecessary decree against women.

564
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,340
Your intention is as clear as day.

565
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,440
Are you still going to deny it?

566
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,500
You're so cheeky in front of your own governor!

567
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,590
You only call yourself a governor!

568
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,070
But a true governor would take care of his people.

569
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,390
Are you saying your position as Sorak County Governor

570
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:40,150
is just a stepping stone to a better position?

571
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,600
Withdraw the ridiculous decree right away!

572
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,200
If you don't, I also will not merely sit back and watch.

573
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,740
Woof, woof, woof, woof!

574
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,010
Stop giving me dog shit and

575
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,630
get lost right away before I lock you up!

576
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,820
I will not be shaken, no matter what you say.

577
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,060
I will find a way to stop all of you from barking.

578
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,730
So brace yourselves and wait.

579
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,080
Hey, wait. Wait, wait.

580
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,250
Since you won't listen to the damn advice intending to save you

581
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,810
but you would rather be plotting at courtesan houses,

582
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:29,660
you will soon end up just like this.

583
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,220
Turn the light on before you go!

584
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,680
Come here, you!

585
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,890
You will not get away with this today!

586
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,880
Come here, I said! Aigoo, shit!

587
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:18,980
Please help me. Please help me.

588
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,240
What is this? Where does it hurt?

589
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,100
My mother could not birth my sister all night long.

590
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,260
She lost a lot of blood.

591
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,490
Are you saying this is your mother's blood?

592
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,790
Why did you come only now?

593
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,110
Because of the prohibitory decree.

594
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,840
That wretched decree.

595
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,560
Wait just a moment. I will get ready.

596
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,170
Jang Goon, please get me tranexamic acid and Buddha's Hand*. 
  (A medicine that helps with a woman's labor)

597
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,400
Okay!

598
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,200
Are you really going on a house call right now?

599
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,810
Governor Ahn is out to get us.

600
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:02,020
If it is not urgent, wait for the physicians to come.

601
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,610
Gosh, I cannot spare even a second because it is a difficult labor.

602
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,050
Where did the physicians go?

603
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,940
Physician Gye headed out to make rounds in the county for patients at dawn.

604
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,210
Other physicians went out early to get medicinal herbs.

605
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,290
Forget that bullshit decree.

606
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,550
Just go.

607
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,060
Two people's lives are at stake.

608
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,360
Granny, what if she gets caught again?

609
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,970
Let us go.

610
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,230
Please be careful!

611
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,530
"The sky was so nice today.

612
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,420
Purple is a wild chrysanthemum.

613
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,220
The wildflowers on the road..."

614
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,390
Have you gone mad?

615
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,480
Hey! Who are you?

616
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,850
Are you a poet or Chil Sung?

617
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:04,820
See, here! We have a great poet here!

618
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,680
Get this man a beating!

619
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,400
I am going to fire you and

620
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,010
make sure you cannot even

621
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:15,220
make a living, do you understand?

622
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,570
 You are a very brave officer.

623
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:31,680
I am a brave officer.

624
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,480
You go die, you bastard!

625
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,910
Please cut it out!

626
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,460
How dare you, although I was not surprised.

627
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,990
How dare you do that to your superior's face? Look at your glaring eyes.

628
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,270
I wrote everything as you ordered.

629
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,350
So take a look here!

630
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,760
If you fire me,

631
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,960
I will get you fired as well.

632
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,130
What?

633
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,550
Everything is written here.

634
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,720
How you spied on the Gye Soo Clinic,

635
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,000
how you harassed poor women,

636
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,300
and how you interfered with treatments! All of it!

637
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,030
I will report to His Majesty about them.

638
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,960
Chil Sung, I think you are too carried away, you punk—

639
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,240
Try reporting me, all right?

640
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,750
I hope you will report me. Got it?

641
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,200
You are really done.

642
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,600
I will really go.

643
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,860
Shinmungo*! 
  (A drum of appeal that people beat to draw the King's attention)

644
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:43,440
I will go to beat it!

645
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,170
Lady Eun Woo went by herself?

646
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,500
When and where to?

647
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,660
Yang Sun came up from the village.

648
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,040
She said her mother couldn't give birth all night.

649
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,090
Aigoo. Young Master. Young Master!

650
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,400
There is a beautiful physician inside, right?

651
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,340
That physician is a very skillful one.

652
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,290
So she will save your mother and your sister for sure.

653
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,680
Really?

654
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,390
Of course.

655
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,610
Do you know how to boil water?

656
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,470
Please prepare some boiled water, then.

657
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,670
Okay.

658
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,350
Hang in there a little more.

659
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,220
Physician Yoo!

660
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,730
Lady Eun Woo, how is she?

661
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,310
She is a patient who had come to the clinic before.

662
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,910
A breech baby was expected because the fetus' position was abnormal.

663
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,800
I think she was not able to come to the clinic

664
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,020
even after her contractions because she feared the prohibitory decree.

665
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,300
I see.

666
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,260
Please finish giving acupuncture.

667
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,430
Yes.

668
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,740
Try to push one more time.

669
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,200
You cannot let yourself go!

670
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,410
We cannot give up.

671
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,430
If we do this right, we can save them.

672
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,440
R-Right.

673
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,450
- One... 
 - One...

674
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,590
- two... 
 - two...

675
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:17,370
- three! 
 - three!

676
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,520
One more time. Push one more time!

677
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,030
Just a little more.

678
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,340
Push one more time.

679
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,210
What about the baby?

680
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,370
She is safe. It is a beautiful daughter.

681
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,660
You lost a lot of blood, so I will prescribe you medicine.

682
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,130
Thank you, Physician Seo.

683
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,620
Thank you for saving the baby.

684
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,700
 - Why are you about to cry? 
 - Where is your mother?

685
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,570
 - Why does it matter?  
 - Please stay here for a second.

686
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,310
 Where is your mother?

687
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,780
 Stop crying!

688
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,780
 Stop crying, you brat!

689
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,820
 - We will take you if you cry. 
 - I said stop crying!

690
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,170
What do you think you are doing?

691
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,300
- You go inside and wait. 
 - Okay.

692
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:23,380
What is all this ruckus?

693
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,240
There is a patient in critical condition in there.

694
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,110
I do not know what the matter is, but come again next time.

695
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,630
I do not think we can do that.

696
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,600
We came to see you physicians,

697
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,490
not the patient.

698
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:39,960
We came to teach you what happens when you

699
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,510
violate the decree from the municipal office.

700
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,730
Did I not say it was an emergency?

701
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,320
Violating the noble decree

702
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,280
of the municipal office is the most urgent matter, Physician.

703
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,500
The Royal Decree comes before the municipal office's decree.

704
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,570
You know you will be subject to national law if you interfere with treating a dying patient, right?

705
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,810
National what?

706
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:04,100
Physician Yoo, what is—

707
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,770
Lady Eun Woo, please stay inside.

708
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,020
Aigoo, it is past the Hour of Monkey right now.

709
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,170
What do we do?

710
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,350
Since you violated the decree,

711
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,640
you need to be punished, right?

712
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,010
There is no law that punishes a physician for saving a patient.

713
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:25,290
Aigoo! How scary, is she not?

714
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:28,030
If someone violates the decree

715
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,170
we were told we could rough folks up,

716
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,650
so we're here for a warm up.

717
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,060
We are thugs, so we do not know what you are saying.

718
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,740
But we know how to beat a woman.

719
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,480
Stand back.

720
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,930
We are on our way after saving a person, so we do not wish to harm you.

721
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,430
- So make way. 
 - Make way?

722
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:55,100
Show him what it means to make way!

723
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,400
- Make way for him! 
 - What are you doing right now?

724
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,620
Stop right now!

725
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,440
Gosh, this little.

726
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,070
Physician Yoo.

727
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,540
Lady Eun Woo, please stand back for a moment.

728
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,260
I certainly

729
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:31,440
warned all of you.

730
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,500
- What is this? 
 - What is that?

731
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,760
Gosh, you startled me.

732
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,010
- What is that? Huh? 
 - I thought it was a knife.

733
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,940
Let me tell you what happens if you do not listen to a physician.

734
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,860
Listen carefully.

735
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:13,820
You will be blinded for life if you do not wash your eyes within an hour.

736
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,330
Do you want some as well?

737
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,730
Or will you save the others?

738
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,040
Let's go. A-Are you okay?

739
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,550
Water.

740
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,400
Physician Yoo.

741
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,010
Physician Yoo, your wound.

742
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:44,620
I didn't know because it didn't hurt at all.

743
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,220
Are you not hurt, Lady Eun Woo?

744
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,940
I'm fine.

745
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,250
Let's hurry back so I can treat you.

746
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,750
Lady Eun Woo,

747
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:10,680
if we keep on walking to the end like this,

748
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,030
where will we arrive?

749
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,420
 If only I would vanish,

750
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,770
 then everything else

751
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:57,000
 would find its place again, wouldn't it?

752
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:12,470
Your wound is bigger than I thought.

753
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,150
It must have hurt a lot.

754
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,920
It did not hurt much, so I really had no clue.

755
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,630
This is upsetting.

756
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,910
It hurts.

757
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:31,510
I feel secure because you are here, Lady Eun Woo.

758
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,320
Even so, you got hurt because of me.

759
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,400
It was not because of you.

760
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,630
It is because of that ridiculous decree

761
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,580
and the thugs who are harassing the weak using the decree as an excuse.

762
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,420
If it was not me,

763
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,600
it would have been some other powerless person who got hurt.

764
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,260
Since I have you, who will treat me,

765
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,540
it is better for me to get hurt.

766
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,750
It is all done now.

767
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,370
It's because you looked so haggard

768
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,480
from all the trouble today.

769
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,200
You better have a hearty breakfast tomorrow.

770
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:29,500
Just now, something really bad happened.

771
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:56,830
 If only we had continued the fate that began from those cliffs.

772
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:02,040
 However, no amount of regret

773
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,210
 can reverse what is past.

774
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:30,330
 We must walk the better path

775
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,730
 and never fall down.

776
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:15,090
 All the times I spent learning medicine from you,

777
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:17,660
 were full of happiness.

778
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:20,840
 Remembering the moment we saved each other

779
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,050
 and to always remain indebted to each other.

780
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,510
-  And for that to happen, my only choice,   
 - Lady Eun Woo.

781
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:32,910
 is that I must leave.

782
01:02:54,020 --> 01:03:00,990
♫  Have you noticed the wind blowing?  ♫

783
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:08,110
♫  Bringing this dying love along  ♫

784
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,600
Lady Eun Woo.

785
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:14,880
♫  As I look at you with trembling eyes  ♫

786
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,290
♫  I'm happy even when it hurts  ♫

787
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:23,570
I cannot let you go like this.

788
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,960
♫  Little by little  ♫

789
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,770
Please do not leave.

790
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:33,620
♫  I can engrave you in my heart  ♫

791
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,420
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫

792
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,800
♫  This shouldn't be difficult  ♫

793
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:47,700
♫  There's one that I can't endure, only one thing I can't endure  ♫

794
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:55,600
♫  I wish and hope every night, when I open my eyes one day  ♫

795
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:03,090
♫  I want to embrace you as you are  ♫

796
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,570
 There's a time for letting go and a time for protecting.

797
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,880
 Right now is the time to protect.

798
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,500
 Please let me have it, Mother.

799
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,870
 You dare call her "Mother" in this situation?

800
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:15,030
 You dare come to Heuksando by secretly following Lady Eun Woo?

801
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,340
 You are the one who should stop being clingy!

802
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,220
 What are you trying to do in Hanyang?

803
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,610
 Background check.

804
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,920
 In a very thorough and complete way.

805
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,550
 As long as you want, Physician Seo,

806
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,840
 you can learn more about medicine in Qing Dynasty.

807
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,070
 Physician Yoo?

808
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,960
 You keep getting hurt like that

809
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,710
 if you are with me, Physician Yoo.

810
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,600
 I am not in pain.

811
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,650
 I only loved you to death.

812
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:43,420
♫  I want to embrace you as you are  ♫
