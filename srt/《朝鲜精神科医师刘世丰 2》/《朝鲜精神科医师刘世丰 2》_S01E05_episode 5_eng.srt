1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,010

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,410

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,960

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,150

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,060

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,070

7
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,760
What I want is his heart.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,240
Yoo Se Yeop... I mean...

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,640
Yoo Se Poong's heart.

10
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,680
Give me his heart.

11
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,230
I cannot give it to you,

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,230
because his heart belongs to himself.

13
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,650
Your love for him is

14
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,260
harmful.

15
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,840
How dare you, a mere widow,

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,920
love the Minister of Personnels' son?

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,770
Even I, as the princess, cannot have everything I want.

18
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,330
My feelings for him

19
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,250
are not love.

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,620
I am just acting as Physician Yoo's hands.

21
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,240
Do you mean what you said?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,290
In that case, you should leave this place.

23
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,410
If you do, then I will trust you.

24
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,280
No.

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,910
I will be by his side until he starts giving acupuncture again.

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,100
Until then, I will not leave.

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,270
 Your love for him is harmful.

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,910
 How dare you, a mere widow, love the Minister of Personnels' son?

29
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,440
 As long as it's not love... it is okay.

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,330
Physician Yoo.

31
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,000
Why are you here?

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,200
Did your house call end late?

33
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,630
No.

34
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,050
I came to look for you, Lady Eun Woo,

35
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,580
because I was worried.

36
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,030
Does that mean you...?

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,020
Yes.

38
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,900
I went to the bookstore first.

39
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,200
Then, did you hear everything?

40
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,080
Yes.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,890
By chance.

42
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,630
Lady Eun Woo,

43
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,720
if I am able to give acupuncture again, will you leave me?

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,820
What about you, Physician Yoo?

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,310
Are you not going to marry Her Highness?

46
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,030
Would it be okay for me to be by your side forever?

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,910
My feelings... are likewise not of love.

48
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,840
My feelings toward Her Highness are absolutely not of love and

49
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,680
there will be no reason to marry her.

50
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,140
However, you are His Majesty's close friend,

51
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,000
so you cannot help it if there is a Royal Decree. Right?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,160
Lady Eun Woo, my heart is in a different place.

53
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,210
Nothing can change that, ever.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,090
Even if it is a Royal Decree.

55
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,710

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,280
 Aigoo, what the heck is this?

57
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,250
- Aigoo, I am sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

58
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,370
 I am sorry!

59
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,070
Do I need to tell you how to prepare a meal now?

60
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,230
Go and redo all of this.

61
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,860
Aigoo, these lowborn.

62
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,590
They don't understand, no matter how many times I tell them.

63
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,190
These lowborn.

64
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,700
This province's foods are just not for me!

65
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,830
You lowborn—

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,220
Oh, Your Highness.

67
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,470
How fond are you to call people lowborn so much

68
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,110
that you dare to blabber like that in presence of the Princess of the Royal Family?

69
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,120
N-No, how c-could I?

70
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,500
Your Highness.

71
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,880
Your Highness, y-your... your precious hand is bleeding!

72
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,860
Aigoo, Your Highness!

73
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,110
Aigoo, what do I do?

74
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,310
Aigoo, Your Highness.

75
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,220
- Aigoo. 
 - Someone, call a physician!

76
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,270
Hey, hurry up! What are you doing? Hurry up!

77
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,160
Your Highness, I will call a physician for you soon!

78
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,620
Come here! Come quickly!

79
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,170
Her Highness has been hurt!

80
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,980
Come here! Come quick!

81
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,960
Is no one here? Hello?

82
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,200
You go inside and sleep.

83
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,820
- W-Why? I want to watch, too. 
 - Geez. Go back in!

84
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,670
Careful, careful.

85
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,770
- Hey, Gye Ji Han! Physician Gye! 
-  Oh, yes, yes.

86
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,880
- Sir Governor. 
 - Hurry. Hurry up and treat Her Highness right now.

87
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
What is the matter?

88
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,430
Come on, hurry!

89
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Aigoo, Your Highness.

90
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,550
W-What is the matter?

91
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,270
Her Highness ended up getting her precious hand injured while venting her anger.

92
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,380
How badly were you venting your anger?

93
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,300
L-Let me see.

94
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,990
I am going to be treated by Yoo Se Yeop.

95
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,530
Hey, Half-wit...

96
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,690
Physician Yoo? Yes, Physician Yoo!

97
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,410
Her Highness is looking for you specifically.

98
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,790
Her Highness is insane.

99
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,090
She could not be breaking down doors every time unless she was insane.

100
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,690
It is because she is young and vigorous.

101
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,960
What? Is that something a physician should say?

102
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,230
Even after seeing my face, which went pale from the shock?

103
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,200
How dare...

104
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,650
a woman yell at the governor?

105
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,310
How outrageous.

106
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,190
 They say you cannot change a person.

107
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,530
 You really haven't changed at all.

108
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,880
I am going to marry you no matter what.

109
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,240
Why is it me, all of a sudden?

110
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,040
That is because you are my first love.

111
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,370
I heard from His Majesty that you were arranged to marry the Chief State Minister's son.

112
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,850
That is a baseless rumor!

113
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,840
How can I marry such a scumbag?

114
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,210
Are you well acquainted with Chief State Minister's Young Master?

115
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,140
No, not at all.

116
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,780
Anyhow, you must marry me. No matter what!

117
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,470
Your Highness, you do not even know what kind of person I really am.

118
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,910
You are a good person, aren't you?

119
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,530
I need someone like that.

120
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,040
I am not a good person.

121
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,510
I am just a person who tried to

122
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,550
give up on myself like a fool after losing everything.

123
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,340
Do you mean you tried to take your own life?

124
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,970
Yes.

125
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,430
Someone saved me when I was trying to jump off a cliff and...

126
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,370
 You will save many lives, so make sure to live!

127
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,460
She told me that I would save many people.

128
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,780
So it was that arrogant girl who saved you?

129
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,890
Therefore, please withdraw the marriage decree.

130
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,750
I merely want to preserve my feelings for her.

131
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,690
But she said she doesn't love you, though.

132
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,980
Are you saying you will chase after her for the rest of your life without getting married?

133
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,090
Gosh, so annoying! Even a half-wit like you exists.

134
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,980
Gosh, seriously. Of all people,

135
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,580
why such a scumbag like him?

136
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,720
No... Why do you keep breaking the doors?

137
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,500
Your Highness!

138
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,100
 Lady Eun Woo, my heart is in a different place.

139
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,430
 Nothing can change that, ever.

140
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,250
 Even if it is a Royal Decree.

141
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,660
Physician Yoo!

142
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,300
Lady Eun Woo, I intend to visit His Majesty.

143
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,590
So suddenly?

144
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,810
I think I can treat Her Highness' heart.

145
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,680
Do you think the Princess suffers from an illness of the heart?

146
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,500
Yes.

147
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,370
Excessive obsession over marrying me...

148
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,200
 I am going to marry you.

149
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,270
Strangely excessive anger...

150
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,620
Her disproportionately irritable response

151
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,410
whenever her fiancé is mentioned.

152
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,010
 Of all people, why a scumbag like him?

153
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,790
If this is not an illness of the heart, then what would be?

154
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,520
Moreover, I am not Her Highness' first love, either.

155
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,090
You are not?

156
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,200
She said you were, though.

157
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,710
If touching one's sleeves were all it took to convince someone to marry,

158
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,060
then you and I should have married a hundred times already.

159
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,710
I am sure the anger within

160
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,610
Her Highness' heart has to do with

161
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,210
- the Chief State Minister's son. 
 - I see.

162
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,590
So you are going to ask His Majesty in person?

163
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,230
Yes, yes, yes.

164
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,090
No matter how close you may be with His Majesty,

165
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,210
since it is a matter of the Royal Family's marriage,

166
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,220
you need to be careful with your words.

167
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,240
Please do not worry, Lady Eun Woo.

168
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,000
While I am away, please look after Her Highness.

169
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,100
See what secret she has buried deep in her heart.

170
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,850
How is the Princess doing?

171
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,040
She is reading a lot of books,

172
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,680
eating her meals well, and is perfectly healthy.

173
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,950
She is probably bothering you a lot.

174
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,340
Not at all, Your Majesty.

175
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,440
Among Father's children,

176
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,800
she's the only one from a lowborn.

177
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,840
So she grew up lonely and sad.

178
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,900
She was a loner.

179
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,500
Se Yeop,

180
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,270
the late King cherished her greatly.

181
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,120
I do as well.

182
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,460
I want to find happiness for my sister, no matter what.

183
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,240
Your Majesty,

184
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,400
do you desire Her Highness' happiness?

185
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,790
Yes.

186
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,640
I want to find that happiness for her.

187
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,020
So I dare to ask you the following.

188
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,610
What exactly happened to Her Highness?

189
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,620
You need to tell me honestly,

190
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,520
so I can find that method, Your Majesty.

191
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,040
Truthfully...

192
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,010
Your Highness, there seemed to be many handsome men in Hanyang.

193
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,560
- Of course, Physician Yoo is handsome as well—
- No.

194
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,780
The Chief State Minister's son is way more handsome in terms of looks.

195
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,030
What is this?

196
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,360
Oh, my.

197
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,010
She is Her Highness.

198
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,300
O-Oh, yes.

199
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,950
Your Highness, well,

200
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,300
in that case, why would you reject such a handsome man

201
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,760
and obsess over our young master?

202
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,330
If I may ask.

203
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,920
Having a kind heart is more important than having a handsome face.

204
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,420
One who talks kindly also makes him look more handsome.

205
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Your Highness, you are like the main character of a novel.

206
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
You dumped a well-off fiancé and

207
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,320
came down here following your kind-hearted first love.

208
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,370
- You are very smart. 
 - Sorry?

209
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,420
Yes.

210
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,110
That was it.

211
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,900
That was the circumstance I wanted.

212
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,100
It's okay. No need to be scared. Keep eating.

213
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,980
It wasn't Physician Yoo.

214
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,800
She liked the Chief State Minister's son.

215
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,210
Gosh, what on Earth happened between them?

216
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,910
I came to see this household's son.

217
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,090
Who might you be to be coming to the Chief State Minister's house without a word?

218
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,660
I am

219
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,190
his colleague from the Office of Special Advisers.

220
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,170
Aigoo, the young master is far away and not here at the moment.

221
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,460
- Far away? 
 - Yes.

222
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,240
How far away?

223
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,910
 Your Highness!

224
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,510
Come in.

225
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,840
I don't want to be treated by you.

226
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
Bring me Yoo Se Yeop.

227
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,370
Physician Yoo went to visit His Majesty.

228
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,430
Without even telling me?

229
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,130
Please tell me if it hurts.

230
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,660
Gosh, it hurts right now!

231
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,670
Please endure for a moment.

232
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,340
Gosh, seriously.

233
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,090
Why did you become a lowly female physician

234
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,150
when you are from a noble family?

235
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,400
Was being a widow not enough for you?

236
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,990
Is class that important to you, Your Highness?

237
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,640
Of course, it is. It's of the utmost importance.

238
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,190
I became a physician to find happiness.

239
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,610
Did you not come all the way here searching for happiness, too, Your Highness?

240
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,580
If class is most important to you, how come

241
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,820
you rejected the Chief State Minister's son, one of the highest-ranking nobles?

242
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,250
How dare you! What do you even know?

243
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,540
I am a noble princess.

244
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,410
I am not lowly like you people.

245
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,940
Wait,

246
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,190
has she always been that fiercely tempered?

247
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,000
How do you stand staying by her side?

248
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,770
Well, she is not always like that.

249
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,400
It is because she has been in a bad mood lately.

250
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,000
By the way, Lady Eun Woo is our precious physician,

251
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,610
so if she lashes out during every treatment like that

252
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,200
even if she is Her Highness, it is problematic.

253
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,690
You are going too far here.

254
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,660
Are you calling Her Highness a ruffian or something?

255
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,880
I mean, take a look at that door.

256
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,980
Even a ruffian does not do that at a clinic.

257
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,370
Wait a minute.

258
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,220
She didn't try to grab Lady Eun Woo's hair yet, right?

259
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,530
Physician Gye!

260
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,420
I know, I know.

261
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,580
But you know, since her temper is too much like this...

262
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,110
You stayed in the Princess' Pavilion this long because you have a great personality.

263
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,380
Other people would have quit already.

264
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,350
Well, that is indeed true, but...

265
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,130
You must have gone through a lot of trouble at the palace,

266
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,260
seeing how she is now.

267
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,190
Father, what are you doing? We are behind on needle treatment!

268
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,150
Oh, okay, okay. I'm coming.

269
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,670
Now, then.

270
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,490
Hey!

271
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,280
Why do you run off to Hanyang all the time?

272
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,100
Do you know how much I worked all day?

273
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,270
I am the only one generous enough to keep a useless one like you!

274
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,780
Did you not say this handsome face of mine is my worth?

275
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,550
Aren't you being too shameless?

276
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,980
"If you lie with dogs, you will rise with fleas."

277
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,260
You are bound to take after bad traits splendidly.

278
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,090
Wait, so what had happened to the Princess, Physician Yoo?

279
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,700
His Majesty told me everything.

280
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,940
 Right before the wedding

281
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,060
 the Princess had disappeared.

282
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,170
 Your Highness!

283
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,850
 - Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

284
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,470
 - Your Highness! 
 - Pardon?

285
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,210
 Then what happened to the planned wedding?

286
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,520
 We said she was ill.

287
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,540
 Chief State Minister wants to make this marriage happen anyhow.

288
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,600
 He said he wanted to hold the wedding

289
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,900
 once the Princess recovers.

290
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,000
 In fact, even now.

291
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,370
 Even now?

292
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,430
 Are you saying he still wants the marriage?

293
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,730
 Why did Her Highness refuse the marriage and run away?

294
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,370
 That, I cannot tell.

295
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,010
 I cannot figure out what her intentions are.

296
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,870
 She will not talk even when her brother, the king, scolds or persuades her.

297
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,060
 So how can I tell her intentions?

298
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,150
 That is a baseless rumor!

299
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,530
 How can I marry such a scumbag?

300
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,910
 Se Yeop,

301
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,320
 are you not a physician who treats people's hearts?

302
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,730
 Please find an answer to the princess's heart as well.

303
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,910
She ran away the day before the wedding?

304
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,870
Then the palace must have been turned upside down.

305
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,800
I mean, even if she does as she pleases,

306
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,050
she ran away from a wedding ceremony?

307
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,120
His Majesty is such a man of virtue.

308
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,860
Anyhow, something must have happened between them that day.

309
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,080
Yes.

310
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,480
However, I think she liked him a lot up to that point.

311
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,540
She said he is more handsome...

312
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,890
than you are, Physician Yoo.

313
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,080
Is that true?

314
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,150
She has been using me thus far.

315
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,390
If the person she liked made a mistake the day before the wedding...

316
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,130
In that case,

317
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,330
the disappointment must have been greater.

318
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,990
But why does Her Highness loath the lowborn so much and

319
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,960
obsesses over noble things?

320
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,780
Even earlier...

321
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,220
 I am a noble princess.

322
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,400
 I am not lowly like you people.

323
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,680
 Among Father's children

324
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,770
 she's the only one from a lowborn.

325
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,370
 So she grew up lonely and sad.

326
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,870
What is the matter, seriously?

327
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,320
What do you mean?

328
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,230
You know I am unable to ask you

329
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,380
because I don't want to be intrusive.

330
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,980
Goodness.

331
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,680
You used to sing praises of the Chief State Minister's son.

332
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,100
But you suddenly said you could not marry him.

333
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,810
And out of the blue, you're doing this to Physician Yoo?

334
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,930
Because he is a scumbag.

335
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,020
I brought these on the way back from Hanyang.

336
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,840
- Help yourselves. 
 - Wow.

337
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,710
Should you not thank my young master?

338
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,950
Thank you.

339
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,600
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Thank you for the food.

340
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,030
Which one of you is Yoo Sae Yeop?

341
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,210
At first glance, the one with the pretty face

342
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,770
must be you.

343
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,300
I heard you are such a philanderer, huh?

344
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,810
Even having an affair with a widow.

345
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,190
I...

346
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,790
came to protect Her Highness!

347
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:28,140
Where did you bring such an ill-tempered Young Master this late at night?

348
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,780
I am the Chief State Minister's son, a special advisor to His Majesty, Yoon Ji Ho.

349
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,310
 Young Master is far away and not here at the moment.

350
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,740
 Far away?

351
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,250
I am Her Majesty the Queen.

352
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,980
- I am Jang Goon. 
 - I am Young Master's servant

353
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,440
Man Bok.

354
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,330
I am skillful Namhaedaek!

355
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,360
Stop it now. That is enough.

356
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,940
- Take a seat, everyone. 
 - I should.

357
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,540
Physician Yoo, Physician Yoo.

358
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,320
Please head inside. Inside, please.

359
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,370
What are you doing right now?

360
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Her Highness is coming! She is coming!

361
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,520
Aigoo, aigoo.

362
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,880
- What? 
 - To the left.

363
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,460
Oh, my... the night air

364
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,180
is just so great.

365
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,710
W-What is that over there?

366
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,480
I will ask you a few things.

367
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,290
You need to tell me honestly, so I can resolve the situation.

368
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,300
Are we not opening tomorrow? Hurry up and go to sleep.

369
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,760
- Gosh, seriously. 
 - Father, I can't hear!

370
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,360
You can hear it from Half-wit tomorrow in detail.

371
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,940
Hurry up and go inside. Hurry up now!

372
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,510
- Gosh, seriously! 
 - Hurry now. Go!

373
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,220
Goodness, you people. Go, go!

374
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,520
What's so curious about this anyway?

375
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,100
I cannot hear a thing.

376
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,020
Now, now, now. Young Master is the Chief State Minister's son and

377
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,490
Young Lady is Her Highness, okay?

378
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,110
Now, a round of applause.

379
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,120
Please reenact as you heard it now.

380
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,750
Gosh, I am curious to death.

381
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,430
What happened between the two of them?

382
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,880
I just cannot do it.

383
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,510
This is so stifling, seriously.

384
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,370
You are the only one who heard directly last night, Physician Yoo!

385
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,470
Are you playing one of the tricks you learned while acting as an orator?

386
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,080
Now, now. Everyone, pay up.

387
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,100
- Do you have some? 
 - I don't have money, either.

388
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,190
Lady Eun Woo, everything you will hear from now

389
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,690
was not said by me.

390
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,750
It is all what this man said.

391
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,960
I, the son of the Chief State Minister and

392
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,840
the oldest son of a noble family, sought after by everyone,

393
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,950
have desired to be wed with you,

394
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,860
the daughter of a lowborn dancer.

395
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,250
During the entire preparation for the wedding,

396
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,930
even among criticisms from relatives who worried about Your Highness' lowly background

397
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,110
and mockeries from my friends,

398
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,730
my feelings for Your Highness could not be quenched.

399
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,870
Since I first saw you at the Official Birthday Feast of the late King,

400
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,730
I deeply cherished my yearning heart for Your Highness.

401
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,350
I am happy because

402
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,870
it looks like this suffering will surely end

403
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,440
when we get married tomorrow.

404
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,130
Is this a confession or an insult?

405
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,470
Isn't he trying to humiliate her?

406
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,750
He belittled her properly.

407
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,800
Even so, Young Master Yoon does not know what he did wrong.

408
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,100
Although he genuinely loves Her Highness,

409
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,290
he just says everything as he thinks.

410
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,730
I think I will need to prepare a special training.

411
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,140

412
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,550
What the heck are they scheming?

413
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,440
Your Highness!

414
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,100
Please wait!

415
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,330
What is this?

416
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,500
This is my heart.

417
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,190
You need to eat it over there.

418
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,420
Please have some.

419
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,340

420
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,780
All right.

421
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,050
Although your feelings are genuine,

422
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,250
you became distant from Her Highness because of your rough and straightforward speech.

423
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:39,900
Therefore, you will learn how to deliver your genuine feelings to Her Highness today.

424
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,250
This is a pinpoint lesson on using kind words,

425
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,280
so listen carefully once and try it properly.

426
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,300
Yes.

427
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,500
First off, whatever you are saying,

428
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,580
say them slowly and gently.

429
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,950
Never tell her to do this and that!

430
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,160
If you are not sure, you can just ask and end your sentence with a question.

431
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,510
Simple, right?

432
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,460
Now, here comes the example!

433
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,340
Now.

434
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,150
I hurt my foot, so I cannot walk anymore.

435
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,550
All right, Young Master?

436
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,980
Then you can just call a physician instead of walking.

437
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,980
My goodness.

438
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,450
All right, please repeat after me, okay?

439
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,830
- Ouch! 
 - Aigoo, my goodness!

440
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,310
Are you okay? Do you want to get on my back?

441
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,530
Yes!

442
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,840
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

443
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,010
- Do you want to get on my back? 
 - Do you want to get on my back?

444
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,530
Whoa. Wow.

445
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,480
He is really hopeless.

446
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,060
He cannot.

447
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,280
His face spared him his life.

448
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,220
Since people look down on me for my lowly birth,

449
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,320
it makes me so sad!

450
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,840
You are still the most wealthy lowborn, are you not?

451
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,570
If you say it like that, you will only hurt a lady's heart!

452
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,750
Why would she get hurt when it is the truth?

453
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,790
No, the thing is.

454
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,690
It is sad. Just sad.

455
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,000
He is as hopeless as they come.

456
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,150
I cannot do this anymore.

457
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,300
Do not give up.

458
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,840
Aigoo, just tell him to memorize!

459
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,610
If memorizing doesn't work?

460
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,700
Then just...

461
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,200
- beat him with— 
 - Aigoo, Granny!

462
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,070
Jang Goon is listening!

463
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,580
Memorize?

464
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,350
Memorize it?

465
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,530
What makes you so lifeless?

466
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,810
A person's heart is not so easy.

467
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,660
It is because Physician Yoo is not even visiting, let alone treating you, right?

468
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,110
How do you know everything?

469
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,290
It is obvious.

470
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:55,240
Aigoo. I had a clear plan for everything when I came here.

471
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,890
Does fate work as you please like that?

472
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,810
That Yoon Ji Ho, who gossips behind... No.

473
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,170
Who brazenly insults people to their face,

474
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,710
I'll just dump him and marry my first love.

475
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,100
How perfect is this?

476
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:15,950
It is a story fitting for a romance novel, isn't it?

477
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,930

478
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,820
Novels are the best for escaping from reality.

479
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,180
I should have just started reading this.

480
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,780
Sure. That is right.

481
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,240
The one who loves more is always the weaker one.

482
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,380
Gosh, they always misunderstand each other like this.

483
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,170
- Your Highness. 
 - What?

484
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,570
You are reading them too fast.

485
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,220
Finding new volumes are so hard, too.

486
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,870
Why is it hard to find the new volume?

487
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,110
Bring them, even if you have to copy them.

488
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,390
Your Highness.

489
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,900
What brings you again?

490
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,090
Well,

491
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,320
please recommend a soft and sweet one for me.

492
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,910
You are going to read it?

493
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,680
Well, for you...

494
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,720
I think manly novels like "Story of Madam Park" are fitting.

495
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,660
No, not really.

496
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,720
What I want to read are romance novels with a lot of tingling

497
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,650
scenes of love confessions.

498
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,780
Romance novels?

499
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,950
"The Goblin Story."

500
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,100
She read this already.

501
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,000
And this, too.

502
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,230

503
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,590
Whoa, w-why is this—

504
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,560
No need to be embarrassed.

505
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,770
I completely understand.

506
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,600
What do you understand, exactly?

507
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,860
Oh my.

508
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,140
Why did you even follow me here?

509
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,210
I stopped by on the way to find medicinal herbs.

510
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,330
By the way, your preference is a bit...

511
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:29,680
I came to find books for Her Highness to read.

512
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,930
Has she seen the new volume?

513
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,870
You look so fine when you smile.

514
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,760
Why are you so full of anger all the time?

515
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,330
Wait.

516
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,070
How silly.

517
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,080
You do not even remember.

518
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,860
Jung—

519
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:19,690

520
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,200
Lady Eun Woo, who could this writer be?

521
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,700
Why?

522
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,560
"Do I like you?

523
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,720
Every moment I spent with you... shined.

524
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,570
Because the weather was good,

525
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,590
because the weather was bad

526
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,840
and because the weather was good enough.

527
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,020
I loved every moment of it."

528
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:05,690
♫  I remember the first time I saw you  ♫

529
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:11,800
♫  The moment your eyes met my eyes  ♫

530
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,480
Whoa! How could they...

531
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,820
How could they write such lines?

532
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,540
That part just now,

533
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,230
I will include it for sure. It made my heart race.

534
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,290
Is that true?

535
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,900
I learned a lot of things this time, Lady Eun Woo.

536
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,700
I was also rather straightforward, wasn't I?

537
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,490
From now on, I think I can be gentle as well.

538
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,540
Even so, you don't speak thoughtlessly like him, at least, Physician Yoo.

539
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,140
You are so considerate.

540
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,440
Is that true?

541
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,230
It is not easy to write these, is it?

542
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,190
I will give them a read.

543
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,130
You cannot read it yet.

544
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,900

545
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,830
Lady Eun Woo.

546
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,130
Is it okay?

547
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,520
Yes.

548
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,800
My heart is racing right now.

549
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,540
How could it be so fun?

550
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,610
It is so fun that it makes me worry if the Chief State Minister's son can even bring these lines to life.

551
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,820
Is it that good?

552
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,870
Yes! Lady Eun Woo, you must be a genius, I think.

553
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,210
Very well then.

554
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,330
Please read me that line from earlier again.

555
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,590
"Do... I like you?"

556
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,960
Wait, I am not sure if this is right.

557
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,590
It is right!

558
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:14,980
He is ridiculously good at treating illnesses of the heart.

559
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,390
I am letting myself be fooled only once, since I am out of options, too.

560
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,220
If you try anything funny, I will

561
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,620
knock everything over.

562
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,840
Gosh, how gorgeous.

563
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,780
It is done.

564
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,730
Why did you spruce me up so much?

565
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:58,160
Court Lady Jung, are you on their side now?

566
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,000
On their side?

567
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,610
My gosh, I am on your side, Your Highness.

568
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,600
Even if I do not marry Yoo Se Yeop,

569
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,230
I will never marry that arrogant scumbag!

570
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,410
There is no such thing as "never."

571
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,840
If it will make you happy, Your Highness—

572
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,370
I will never be able to be happy! I was born this way.

573
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,280
Stop talking like you are a century old and

574
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,490
let us head outside.

575
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,190
No, I said I do not want to.

576
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,550
If you eat this much and do not walk

577
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,130
you will become a pig, Your Highness!

578
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,580
P-Pig?

579
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,080
Did you call me a pig just now?

580
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,600
Ah, ah. Is everyone ready?

581
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,840
I am ready.

582
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,440
 All ready!

583
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,040
I-I am also ready.

584
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,110
Her Highness is here!

585
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,670
Young Master Yoon, be on standby.

586
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,900
 Ip Boon, throw a seagull!

587
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,790
 I repeat, throw a seagull!

588
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,800
Physician Yoo, Her Highness will be there in eight steps.

589
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,550
Please get ready now.

590
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,610
Will it really work if I do as this says?

591
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,710
Yes, that is the best.

592
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,590
You will do great.

593
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,100
Here. Aigoo.

594
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,530
Thank you.

595
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,150
Where the heck are we walking to?

596
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,090
Get out of my sight!

597
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,110
Your Highness!

598
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,480
To me, you are Hwang Jin Yi* and Seong Chun Hyang.* 
  (Hwang Jin Yi is a famous courtesan, Seong Chun Hyuang is a character from a folktale)

599
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,480
I have an ardent affection for you.

600
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,220
Are you bringing up Hwang Jin Yi to talk about a lowborn dancer again?

601
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,880
It is upside-down.

602
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,950
Should I... apologize or

603
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,050
confess?

604
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,600
Step aside unless you want to die!

605
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,690

606
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,400
You are!

607
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,270
In my heart.

608
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,830
It worked, it worked.

609
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,460

610
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,610
Our first encounter was

611
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,290
so beautiful, was it not?

612
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,120
Official Birthday Feast of the late King.

613
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,640
Could you please remember the flowers

614
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,120
and their aroma from back then?

615
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,130
All right. Come out, Castor Bean.

616
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,350
Come out, Castor Bean.

617
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,600
One eagle.

618
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,370
I repeat, one eagle.

619
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,350
You ruined all those good memories, didn't you?

620
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:50,750
Since you have your proud family and lineage of yours,

621
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,280
you'll have good luck for the rest of your life!

622
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,270
- That is a misunderstanding! 
 - Be quiet!

623
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,630
I don't want to hear it!

624
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,360
Oh, no!

625
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,940
B-B-Bees!

626
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,370
- We need to put in mint now. 
 - Yes.

627
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,200
There.

628
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,450
That is enough.

629
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,180
There.

630
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,160
It is a medicine made of sweet wormwood and mint.

631
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,050
It will sting a little.

632
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,790
Gosh, that hurts!

633
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,570
It hurts.

634
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,940
Applying this will soothe the swellings soon,

635
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,080
so please endure for a bit.

636
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,550
I failed to deliver my feelings

637
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,360
because of my shortcomings.

638
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,380
I guess I am really hopeless.

639
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,920
No, you aren't.

640
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,830
You did deliver your genuine feelings,

641
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,600
with all of your body.

642
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,950
Her Highness could not even finish hearing me out.

643
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,180
But you still rescued her, didn't you?

644
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,170
You did great.

645
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,660
Yes.

646
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,920
Young Master Yoon, your heart has been treated.

647
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,190
Although, we still need to treat your body.

648
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,630
You were really wonderful today.

649
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,080
Thank you.

650
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,070
You are a fool.

651
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,880
Your Highness.

652
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,690
No matter how hard you try, nothing will ever change!

653
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:39,360
You worked in vain because you don't know anything!

654
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,390
Your Highness!

655
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,910
Your Highness!

656
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,800
Your Highness!

657
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,760
I am not ill.

658
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,690
That is what everyone thinks.

659
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,350
That they are not ill.

660
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,380
However, even though I'm a physician,

661
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,960
I fall ill often.

662
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,030
Look at this here.

663
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,930
When you are focused on one thing,

664
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,370
you cannot see the good thing

665
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,360
that is right in front of your eyes.

666
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,560
It is pretty.

667
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,870
What made you ill and suffer that badly?

668
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,040
I...

669
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,430
have always lived upright and tense,

670
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,240
because I am a lowborn.

671
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,690
So,

672
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:26,550
I did that to not be reproached by the elders in the palace.

673
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,430
But when I heard it from the person I like,

674
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,520
it hurt even more.

675
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:40,310
Because my birth mother is indeed a lowly dancer,

676
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,040
she could not even be

677
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,010
appointed as a king's concubine after giving birth to me.

678
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,590
Someone I know

679
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,650
became a young widow overnight and

680
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,470
went through many life-and-death situations.

681
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:05,790
However, she said

682
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,860
she wanted to live as herself

683
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:13,910
to me, and that strong heart

684
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:16,290
made me feel ashamed of myself

685
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:19,110
for being heartbroken after losing everything.

686
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,850
Are you saying that is why you fell head over heels for her?

687
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,300
Are you writing a novel right now?

688
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:29,170
Your Highness.

689
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,250
Forget what you couldn't have and

690
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,850
only cherish what you have.

691
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:38,000
You are able to do anything, Your Highness.

692
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,180
Also, you brighten up your surroundings.

693
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,860
However, at the palace

694
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:47,090
no one ever said that to me.

695
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:52,540
You need to cherish yourself for everyone to think so.

696
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:05,670
I apologize for using you as my first love.

697
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,810
But that much should be a given since you are a physician of the heart.

698
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,890
Yes.

699
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,700
I am okay.

700
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,230
Instead, please do not run away at the new wedding, no matter what happens.

701
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,420
Your Highness.

702
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,050
Are you truly

703
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,560
so thoughtless?

704
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,300
Do you not care about your own body?

705
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,990
It is better than having you suffer, isn't it?

706
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,710
I am sorry.

707
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,070
I am so sorry

708
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,350
that my heart aches.

709
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,570
I misunderstood you too much.

710
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,870
Please do not cry.

711
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,240
You are the

712
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,200
most precious person in the world.

713
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,960
You really cured two people at once this time.

714
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,440
You become greater by the day.

715
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,060
Write two people into the journal of Yoo Se Poong, Physician of the Heart.

716
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,620
It is three people, though.

717
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,500
The heart that I truly intended to treat

718
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,740
was yours, Lady Eun Woo.

719
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,430
Ever since Her Highness came down,

720
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,900
you've been on my mind,

721
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,350
because your heart might get hurt.

722
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:07,130
Because Her Highness' sharp words

723
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,780
might eventually hurt you.

724
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,220
However, I could not do anything.

725
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,160
That is why I focused on treating those two.

726
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,040
Not as a physician, but as another human being.

727
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:34,740
♫  I secretly hid you deep in my heart  ♫

728
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,190
If I am able to give acupuncture again,

729
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,250
will you really be leaving me?

730
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:52,000
♫  Fluttering in the wind gently tearing my heart to pieces  ♫

731
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,690
No.

732
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,600
I don't want to leave.

733
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:10,200
♫  If I can send the feelings that seep out of my heart  ♫

734
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:17,800
♫  Spending my days loving and missing you  ♫

735
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:25,400
♫  The one thing that remains constant, the one I love is you  ♫

736
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:31,600
♫  The very words "I love you", I've shouted from my heart hundreds of times  ♫

737
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:37,040
♫  But I can't say aloud  ♫

738
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:44,210
♫  So I'll wait one more day  ♫

739
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,800
- It is my palanquin! 
 - Aigoo!

740
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,010
- Oh, my goodness! 
 - Aigoo.

741
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,620
- W-Why? 
 - I am sorry.

742
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,180
Please!

743
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,150
Aigoo, I do not see Her Highness.

744
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,060
She said she must resolve something before leaving. She's over there.

745
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:13,330
She will not break another door, will she?

746
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,710
No, she won't.

747
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:20,000
This place is the expert on illnesses of the heart.

748
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,380
Her Highness has become such a well-rounded person.

749
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,990
One moment.

750
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,470
What is this atmosphere?

751
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,680
Should we follow them?

752
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,180
What is going on? Huh?

753
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,320
Wait, Young Master.

754
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,990
- Granny. 
 - Granny?

755
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,120
You did well.

756
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,050
For what you did this time.

757
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:08,100
I am giving it to you because I have too much to take to Hanyang.

758
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,810
Right, you mustn't be overburdened.

759
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,860
You can leave it with me.

760
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:22,820
All the bad things I said to you...

761
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,610
I am sorry.

762
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,960
Please don't take it to heart.

763
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,130
Okay.

764
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:33,640
Make sure not to forget as well, Your Highness.

765
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,910
Please always look at the better side of yourself and

766
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,090
compliment yourself.

767
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,420
Wait, did you two plot this?

768
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:48,170
Sorry?

769
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:02,950
Why are you asking me to see you in such a remote place?

770
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:06,230
There is something I need to give you.

771
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,360
Give what?

772
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,590
I am

773
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,780
that palace lady.

774
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,380
You saved me instead of going to the Queen's Pavilion

775
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,100
which caused you to leave the Royal Clinic.

776
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,080
I am

777
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,220
the palace lady you saved back then.

778
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,570
Do you know how sorry

779
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:42,630
I was all my life when I found out later?

780
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:47,070
Saving a person always comes first.

781
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:50,220
There is no need to be sorry for something like that.

782
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:57,420
I heard that if you touch everything just because you are a physician, you get sick easily.

783
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:02,310
Please make sure to have it with you.

784
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:08,630
Thank you for surviving and living well.

785
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:13,670
It makes me feel quite proud.

786
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,920
But why are you telling me this now?

787
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,120
You were so hostile toward me all this time,

788
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,740
so I thought I did you seriously wrong or something before.

789
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:27,090
Well, since you saved me but did not recognize me,

790
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,810
I felt really disappointed.

791
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:32,500
I always thought about

792
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,190
what I would say to you

793
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,120
when we meet again.

794
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,420
Then, let's keep in touch.

795
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,860
Sorry?

796
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:48,140
You can tell me anything through a letter, can you not?

797
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:52,500
Yes. I will buy a rare bamboo paper and write to you first.

798
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,690
So make sure you reply to me.

799
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:58,030
Yes, Physician Gye.

800
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,990
- You promised, okay? 
 - Yes.

801
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,640
Please take care.

802
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,020
Help yourself.

803
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,700
What is this?

804
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,330
How awkward is this for you to offer me a drink?

805
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,720
Help yourself to some smoked-plum drink.

806
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,470
You help yourself all you want.

807
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:34,470
A half-wit who doesn't even know the taste of alcohol.

808
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:37,080
Gosh, it only ruined my palate.

809
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,340
Geez.

810
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,800
If you drink alcohol like water, you will become such and such.

811
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,970
I am sure it tells you in the medical book.

812
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:45,500
Not sure. Is it "live long and healthy"?

813
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,530
"Live forever without aging"?

814
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,400
 Physician Gye!

815
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,800
 A person is dying here!

816
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,440
- Physician Gye! 
 - What is going on?

817
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:39,180
♫  Spending my days loving and missing you  ♫

818
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:43,790
♫  The one thing that remains constant, the one I love is you  ♫

819
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:46,530
 How long have you run this clinic here?

820
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,660
 I told you not to wander around outside!

821
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,650
 Did you have a nightmare again?

822
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,910
 Father, is what the Governor said true?

823
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:56,060
 How long were you going to hide it?

824
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,200
 She might be resenting me.

825
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,470
 You are the one who raised her so well so far.

826
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:02,280
 Physician Gye, big trouble!

827
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,630
 A critical weakness.

828
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:07,410
 That is such a great idea.

 Father!

01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,450
 Not Ip Boon...

831
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,590
 I must protect this child at least.

832
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,710
♫  The one I love is you  ♫

833
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:19,890
♫  The very words "I love you", I've shouted from my heart hundreds of times  ♫
