1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,360
   

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,870
   

3
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,230
   

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,060
   

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,960
   

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,810
Are you all right?

7
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,950
How rude.

8
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,030
What in the world are you doing?

9
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,560
You are the rude one here.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,740
What?

11
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,470
You seem to be hurting her.

12
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,440
Are you all right?

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,030
Yes, I am all right.

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,030
What are you doing with this esteemed Lady at this late hour?

15
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,740
How about you?

16
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,450
What were you doing here at this late hour?

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,750
I am a Royal Physician, so this is like my home.

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,110
Outsiders should leave the palace now.

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,640
I shouldn't have moved.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,030
I saw a ghost as soon as I moved dwellings.

21
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,310
Did the apparition happen to look like...

22
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,680
Clothed with a shroud.

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,170
I'm scared! I'm so scared!

24
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,480
Will you... take care of me here tonight?

25
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,680
You were simply in momentary shock.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,560
I'll brew herbal medicine for you.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,970
Something to help you fall asleep.

28
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,140
Is that all?

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,610
It hurts here...

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,770
and it hurts here, too.

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,940
Massage her thoroughly.

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,850
Yes.

33
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,930
He's become so coldhearted.

34
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,730
Is it here?

35
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,540
Gosh!

36
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,580
Well...

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,340
   

38
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,260
You must be very close to the Princess.

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,450
She sank into your arms as if she had done it before.

40
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,980
What about you?

41
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,460
You looked so cozy in the arms of that Royal Physician from earlier.

42
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,450
How is that the same?

43
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,520
The Princess had clear intentions,

44
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,440
and I simply ran into him accidentally–

45
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,760
Are you and the Princess, perhaps...

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,000
We are not.

47
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,860
It is not the relationship you are thinking of.

48
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,950
A philanderer?

49
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,770
Is it because of your looks?

50
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,150
How unfair.

51
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,520
I was His Majesty's schoolmate, so I did frequently meet the Princess since we were young.

52
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,760
But I have never closely acquainted myself with another woman–

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,250
Yes.

54
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,170
I understand.

55
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,130
You didn't need to try so hard to explain yourself.

56
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,140
I simply... do not want you to misunderstand my feelings.

57
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,900
I am aware that you left your heart here.

58
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,000
That is correct.

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,670
By the way, what was that palace lady doing at an abandoned well?

60
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,180
She says she was just passing by.

61
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,860
Strange, is it not?

62
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,630
All right.

63
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,280
Okay.

64
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,960
That's right.

65
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,490
Okay, lie down.

66
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,520
There, there.

67
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,840
Vomiting and dizziness.

68
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,400
These are the same symptoms as the palace ladies.

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,300
I saw someone sick with the same symptoms earlier today.

70
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Did that person happen to see an apparition, too?

71
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,780
He did not say anything like that.

72
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,770
He just collapsed while vomiting,

73
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,640
and regained consciousness after receiving acupuncture.

74
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,840
For now, we have discerned the common symptoms.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,370
Look at his eyes.

76
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,080
Glaucoma.

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,380
His symptoms are exactly the same as the palace ladies.

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,680
Do you... think the poison is being spread outside the palace?

79
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,040
We must find out and put an end to it.

80
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,420
This could become dire.

81
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,540
Pardon me! Passing through!

82
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,830
Pardon me.

83
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,210
Passing through!

84
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,520
I am sorry. Pardon me!

85
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,440
I am sorry. Passing through.

86
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,030
Pardon me.

87
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,300
Critical patients to this side.

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,970
And people with just dizziness, please stand on this side.

89
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,900
All right, those with just dizziness.

90
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,180
This way, everyone.

91
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,030
Her head hurts?

92
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,830
Does she have a fever, too?

93
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,290
Yes, I'll brew a herbal medicine for you. Take it.

94
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,990
 The disease is said to have spread outside the palace as well. 

95
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,670
In the end,

96
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,800
has it spread to my people as well?

97
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,260
His curse...

98
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,460
 What is going on? 

99
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,010
His Majesty will be dismissing the morning royal audience today.

100
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Is His Majesty aware of the disease spreading outside the palace?

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,910
The news has been delivered.

102
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,950
I knew this would happen.

103
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,060
His Majesty should not have dragged Yoo Se Yeop and the unqualified into this.

104
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,650
Hence, the sickness could not be contained

105
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,010
and even spread outside the palace.

106
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,430
If they cannot resolve this problem,

107
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,040
they shall have to pay the price.

108
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,290
Whatever the case,

109
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,670
the Royal Clinic will do everything in its power.

110
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,350
So please leave it to us.

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,420
The palace ladies' poisoning is being swiftly treated with the antidote,

112
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,570
so please do not be too distraught.

113
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,790
Again.

114
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,870
It is poison again?

115
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,650
Actually,

116
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,740
I have seen him myself.

117
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,650
That man.

118
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,430
Just like... my father, I will also be...

119
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,190
No!

120
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,810
I shall not end up like him!

121
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,630
Your Majesty.

122
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,270
I shall not die!

123
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,620
I absolutely shall not die like him!

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,540
So... you must save me.

125
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,460
You must.

126
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,620
The apparition you witnessed,

127
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,970
what did it look like?

128
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,310
It wore a shroud

129
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,890
and was covered in blood.

130
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,880
With a butterfly belt.

131
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
How could you tell the apparition was Jo Tae Hak?

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,660
The rumors within the palace are rampant.

133
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,900
That the spirit of the dead Left State Minister is wandering around.

134
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,230
You said you just happened to pass by the well, right?

135
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,810
 She couldn't have just been passing by. 

136
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,170
 She came to an abandoned well. 

137
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
 In the middle of the night... Why? 

138
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,480
 She definitely had a purpose. 

139
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,240
 The scent of lilies? 

140
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,060
 Where is it coming from? 

141
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,440
 A ghost! 

142
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,780
 They say that the ghost of Jo Tae Hak was haunting the palace. 

143
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,390
Who dares to loiter around the palace?

144
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,310
I am a female physician from Gye Soo Clinic who received a Royal Order from His Majesty.

145
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,060
Oh, I recognize you.

146
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,180
That improper widow.

147
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,780
The one who lost all sense of ethics and destroyed her in-laws.

148
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,930
You should become civilized first before becoming a physician.

149
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,500
What?

150
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,300
Were you wandering around the palace trying to get a chance to seduce His Majesty?

151
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,670
How could you say something so demeaning?

152
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,700
How dare you speak so brazenly to me?

153
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,100
Do you fear nothing just because His Majesty takes a liking

154
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,390
to your group of wicked people?

155
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,880
Chief Royal Physician, Left State Minister is looking for you.

156
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,410
For what reason?

157
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,060
Where is he right now?

158
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,500
He stopped by the Royal Clinic, but I am not so sure now.

159
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,530
Just when I happened to be away,

160
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,950
Left State Minister happened to visit.

161
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,420
We met last night, didn't we?

162
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,600
I am not on his side.

163
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,270
I am a good person.

164
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,750
I am also a widower.

165
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,970
I lost my wife long ago.

166
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,110
We are in the same boat.

167
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,790
I happened to hear everything.

168
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,200
I am a physician at the Royal Clinic, Jeon Kang Il.

169
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,270
I am also a physician.

170
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,090
I am aware.

171
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,920
You came here with Yoo Se Yeop, right?

172
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,400
If I may inquire about your name?

173
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,340
Seo Eun Woo.

174
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,240
That is a pretty name.

175
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,540
For Chief Royal Physician's sin,

176
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,740
I'd like to atone in his place by treating you to some mandarin orange tea.

177
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,420
No, it is okay.

178
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,300
I have something to look into right now.

179
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,340
Into what?

180
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,410
Could I be of any help?

181
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,090
Well, then...

182
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,030
is there a place within the palace where they grow lilies?

183
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,600
Lilies?

184
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,960
No.

185
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,800
As far as I know, there is none.

186
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,650
Those used for medicine are from outside.

187
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,780
That is weird.

188
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,230
Then what was that scent?

189
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,680
I do not think I can drink the mandarin orange tea.

190
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
Lady Eun Woo.

191
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,570
Did something happen with that man?

192
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,400
Oh, it is nothing.

193
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,450
He helped me, so we exchanged names.

194
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,620
Exchanged names?

195
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,210
What did that man help you with?

196
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,840
That is... something you don't need to care about.

197
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,580
Wait. While that man knows everything,

198
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,210
I should not even care about it?

199
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,000
That cannot do. I want to care no matter what.

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,690
Please tell me everything without hesitation.

201
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,850
She even accepted my heart,

202
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,620
and yet keeps a secret with another man?

203
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,190
Jang Goon, how many antidotes do we have left?

204
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,250
- Please take care. 
 - Not that many.

205
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,240
Yes, yes.

206
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,530
What the heck?

207
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,570
Why won't the number of patients go down?

208
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,430
Gosh.

209
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,900
Father,

210
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,510
you see... I... you know...

211
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,700
You need to earn your keep, please!

212
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,040
We're so busy. Where were you all this time?

213
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,220
Go change and come back out!

214
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,190
What's this?

215
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,970
You look like a thief who came...

216
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,650
to rob her old father's pocket money after wasting all her money out there.

217
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,780
Especially in Physician Gye's room.

218
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,220
What?

219
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,990
Perhaps, are you really wasting money out there?

220
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,370
Those unnies...

221
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,330
You wasted all your money?

222
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,970
All of it?

223
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,260
What were you doing?

224
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,240
Hey, how much were you robbed in total?

225
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,040
I think... I lost all that I had.

226
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,940
Whoa.

227
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,700
What's this?

228
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,050
Why do you keep glancing at her?

229
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,320
Namhaedaek, did you invest money in Ip Boon by chance?

230
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,190
Didn't the fabric shop promise to pay you back many-fold?

231
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,620
My goodness. And they say fortune-tellers can't predict their own demise.

232
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,380
Are you actually unable to see your own future at all?

233
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,690
Gosh, shut up!

234
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,970
Hey, were you ripped off completely?

235
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,460
Are we never going to get it back?

236
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,970
I don't think we can.

237
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,470
Those unnies are really scary women.

238
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,890
Was it Sogyeok-dong Firewood?

239
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,100
They mentioned a scary man with that name and kept beating me.

240
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,750
They said they would set the clinic on fire if I caused trouble.

241
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,690
Aigoo!

242
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,740
Gosh.

243
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,340
I should have known when I saw their terrible faces.

244
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,170
We will just have to consider it an expensive lesson.

245
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,330
Those rotten wenches!

246
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,690
Why would you pay so much money for such a low-quality lesson?

247
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,970
I guess I was away from the capital for too long.

248
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,540
Sogyeok-dong Firewood?

249
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,210
I heard another weird story.

250
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,470
What story?

251
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,530
They said the liquor jugs keep disappearing from the King's cellar.

252
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,220
Why would they disappear from the palace?

253
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,220
That is what I am saying.

254
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,370
Does it have to do with this occurrence?

255
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,020
That's why I looked into it further.

256
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,180
They said the first palace lady with symptoms,

257
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,990
was in charge of the liquor in the King's cellar.

258
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,270
That means...

259
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,200
 Why would you pass by there at that late hour? 

260
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,640
She is hiding something.

261
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,470
I need to see that palace lady in person.

262
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,310
It doesn't seem like she went far away.

263
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,700
She might have gone to the cellar for her shift.

264
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,530
We must find her.

265
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,700
Shit!

266
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,110
How dare you—

267
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,660
It's Palpan-dong Castor Bean!

268
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,590
Castor Bean came back to Hanyang!

269
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,470
Castor Bean!

270
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,290
Wow. Sogyeok-dong Firewood.

271
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,290
You need to bow if you see your hyungnim.

272
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,780
Move aside.

273
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,070
You are cute. You grew up a lot, you piglet.

274
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,840
   

275
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,740
Forget it.

276
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,500
   

277
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,080
I-I apologize, Hyungnim.

278
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,020
I am sorry!

279
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,670
Because you were gone from the capital for a long time, my boys made a mistake!

280
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,910
 We made a mistake! 

281
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,900
So, why would you make a mistake?

282
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,840
A mistake is

283
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,680
there for you to fix it, right?

284
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,660
Aigoo. This one is my mistake.

285
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,550
Hey, you

286
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,630
just have the money returned.

287
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,880
You better not ramble on about Castor Bean and stuff.

288
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,570
Yes, Orabeoni.

289
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,830
Of course. Three times more.

290
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,160
How many times?

291
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,610
Three times.

292
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,840
Hey, you seem to have made some money,

293
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,430
but you still go around frugally and sincerely

294
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,890
cheating people for their money?

295
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,940
No, I do not!

296
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,820
I got some free liquors,

297
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,130
so my livelihood is a bit better now.

298
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,050
Hey, get up.

299
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,970
- Yes, stand up for just a moment. 
 - Get up?

300
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,790
Aigoo.

301
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,560
Aigoo.

302
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,710
Who would... give out...

303
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,570
alcohol for free?

304
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,550
It is really true!

305
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,660
Hey,

306
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,650
are you taking me lightly because I live quietly

307
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,120
in the countryside?

308
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,410
No, it is really true!

309
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,230
On top of that,

310
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,860
it's from the palace.

311
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,580
A palace lady is giving out alcohol?

312
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,350
Where did you hear about this?

313
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,310
Seriously.

314
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,200
Who would give out free alcohol, especially at the palace?

315
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,410
I heard it when I went to get Physician Gye's booze.

316
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,340
Just wait a minute, please.

317
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,790
You gave money to Ip Boon so easily,

318
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,340
and you cannot trust me on this one?

319
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,590
You say you can peer into the future, but was that all a lie?

320
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,670
Shut up!

321
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,100
Aigoo.

322
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,910
Seriously, he is as naïve as me.

323
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,410
That money will come back many-fold.

324
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,000
Don't stay upset over a thing like that.

325
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,330
What?

326
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,300
Lady Eun Woo. It is that palace lady.

327
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,690
Yes,

328
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,610
but what is she doing right now?

329
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,010
Why did you do that?

330
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,330
It is not that you sold it for money.

331
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,040
To live...

332
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,370
I did it only to save my life.

333
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,820
What does that mean?

334
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,940
That letter.

335
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,800
I...

336
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,980
received a letter from Jo Tae Hak's ghost.

337
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,900
 In order for me not to die, 

338
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,770
 I need to drink from the well in Queen's Pavilion 

339
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,060
 and send out liquor made with water from that well. 

340
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,600
 After sending out the liquor, 

341
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,940
 I need to beg the moon for my life. 

342
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,800
 Everyone drink up! 

343
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,630
 How great. 

344
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,700
 All right! 

345
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,100
Let's say you did that because you got that letter, Palace Lady Oh.

346
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,100
But why did other palace ladies of Queen's Pavilion also drink from that well?

347
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,420
Because of the rumor.

348
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,400
"Jo Tae Hak's ghost laid a curse.

349
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
If you do not want to die, you have to drink from the well."

350
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,920
Yes!

351
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,430
I am sure everyone who heard the rumor did so.

352
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,330
But everyone got ill!

353
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,800
In the end, you cannot avoid the curse.

354
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,430
The water from the well...

355
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,590
The scent of lilies!

356
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,610
But it definitely is not the season for lilies to bloom.

357
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,600
 It has a scent similar to lilies, but is poisonous. Thus take caution. 

358
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,750
Physician Yoo.

359
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,550
What do you think?

360
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,500
It definitely smells like lilies, right?

361
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,700
Yes, however, lilies would not bloom underwater.

362
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,210
This is not a lily but a plant with the same scent.

363
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,350
Could it be the Heavenly Maiden Flower?

364
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,570
Yes.

365
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,950
Most poisonous plants have a terrible odor,

366
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,220
but the Heavenly Maiden Flower has the scent of a lily.

367
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,570
That's why everyone was able to ingest this water without trouble.

368
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,610
Heavenly Maiden Flower's poison...

369
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,980
causes vomiting and dizziness.

370
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,040
It also causes glaucoma.

371
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,580
Someone intentionally poisoned the well with

372
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,600
Heavenly Maiden Flower and spread the sickness to the palace ladies.

373
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,500
Patients in the town also got sick from drinking alcohol made with this water.

374
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,930
I will tell them to close the well right away.

375
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,590
We also need to go to the clinic and check if the patients drank that liquor.

376
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,470
Gosh, that feels great.

377
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,260
Aigoo, my back.

378
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,280
Aigoo, where is this liquor from?

379
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,680
Shall we have a scent check?

380
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,470
Whoa, it smells great.

381
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,010
Then, just one sip.

382
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,750
No, you cannot!

383
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,120
Young Lady! W-What's the matter?

384
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,140
You're as energetic as ever.

385
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,260
Oh, my.

386
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,070
I am sorry, Physician Gye.

387
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,280
However, you absolutely cannot drink this liquor.

388
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,780
The sickness among the palace ladies and the town is all because of this liquor.

389
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,090
What?

390
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,150
What?

391
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,440
Father, that was close.

392
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,620
- Aigoo... 
 - Oh, my.

393
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,100
Aigoo.

394
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,710
Poison?

395
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,460
Then the things I saw...

396
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,820
Are they all just hallucinations?

397
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

398
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,560
They are hallucinations caused by drinking liquor made with

399
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,570
water from the well in Queen's Pavilion.

400
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,530
I will also provide you the omnipotent antidote,

401
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,120
so please do not worry about the apparition.

402
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,640
That is fortunate.

403
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,500
That really is fortunate.

404
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,200
You saved me once again.

405
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,380
As we thought, closing down the well stopped increasing more patients.

406
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,290
Yes. I am so glad

407
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,530
that the sickness was taken care of without major trouble.

408
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,800
- Move aside! 
 - Move aside!

409
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,000
- Move aside! 
 - Aigoo, what is going on?

410
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,000
 The famine and the disease 

411
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,500
 are curses from the Heavens because of the dishonorable king. 

412
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,470
Find them!

413
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,860
Anyone scheming treachery

414
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,780
will be facing the death sentence!

415
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,940
 Truly... 

416
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,560
 do you not fear death? 

417
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,740
Where are you?

418
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,800
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

419
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,960
Yes.

420
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,970
Yoo Se Yeop.

421
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,320
Bring me Yoo Se Yeop!

422
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,820
Yes, Sire!

423
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,000
Yes!

424
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,080
Yes, Your Majesty!

425
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,410
   

426
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:21,210
His Majesty has called in Yoo Se Yeop again last night.

427
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,880
How utterly humiliating!

428
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,370
If we cannot beat those bastards,

429
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,700
then we will all be kicked out of the palace!

430
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,120
His Majesty's condition has worsened.

431
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,370
Although we got rid of the Heavenly Maiden Flowers,

432
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,690
I heard he saw Jo Tae Hak's ghost again last night.

433
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,500
That means the poisonous flower is not the cause.

434
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,200
Did His Majesty hallucinate because his vigor weakened

435
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,420
or did he really see something?

436
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,700
Could I take a look around the king's bed-chamber?

437
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,690
What are you looking for?

438
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,140
A trace.

439
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,270
Did it not rain last night?

440
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,770
Perhaps, he might have left a footprint.

441
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,270
A ghost's footprint?

442
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:26,200
His Majesty's sleeping quarters seem too quiet.

443
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,820
His Majesty asked everyone else to leave except for a few trusted eunuchs.

444
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,180
His Majesty gets anxious if there are too many people around him.

445
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,270
Physician Yoo, take a look at this.

446
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,540
I am going to meet His Majesty.

447
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,020
He said absolutely no one is allowed to enter this time.

448
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,990
You think I'm meeting him for no reason?

449
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,550
I have made a big decision.

450
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,240
What decision?

451
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,610
I am going to get married.

452
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,440
You should've done so sooner. Why now?

453
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,760
Not to the son of the Chief State Minister.

454
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,180
Pardon?

455
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,030
What are you doing here?

456
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:22,200
His Majesty even told the eunuchs from his bed-chamber to leave.

457
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,250
How did that happen?

458
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:30,290
After speaking with  Physician Yoo and some female physician in private,

459
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,380
His Majesty's illness seems to have gotten worse.

460
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,000
How is His Majesty doing?

461
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,330
Is it really bad?

462
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,990
You see...

463
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,860
 Leave at once! 

464
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,360
 You shall receive death by dismemberment once more! 

465
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,900
Do you really think it will appear tonight?

466
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,930
Yes.

467
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,710
He should definitely be feeling rushed by now,

468
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,490
since Palace Lady Oh was caught too soon.

469
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,330
Why do you two always go around together?

470
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,010
Walk three steps apart from each other.

471
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,460
After you whispered into His Majesty's ears,

472
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,750
His Majesty's condition has worsened, I hear.

473
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,550
Your Highness, that's–

474
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,300
Physician Yoo.

475
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,700
Look at this sly wench.

476
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,040
What are you scheming?

477
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,500
It is a good idea for His Majesty to be alone for now.

478
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,980
She is the reason I am unable to meet His Majesty.

479
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,780
Thus, you must apologize to me.

480
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,330
Kneel before me at once!

481
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,560
Your Highness, Royal Princess.

482
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,570
I have done nothing wrong to apologize to you, Your Highness.

483
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,050
Is that so?

484
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,400
Regardless, I still want to see you kneel before me.

485
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,320
So, kneel.

486
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,240
This is an order as the Princess.

487
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,940
Your Highness.

488
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,170
Whatever apology you seek,

489
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,700
I shall do it.

490
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,020
Why would you?

491
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,220
Get up this instant!

492
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,810
Then will you let us go?

493
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,110
Please get up, Physician Yoo.

494
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,700
Let us go, Lady Eun Woo.

495
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,760
What's that?

496
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,680
What on earth is their relationship?

497
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,030
Don't be too distraught.

498
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,690
Her Highness has such an unpredictable temper

499
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,450
that even His Majesty finds it difficult to handle her.

500
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,690
But you had to kneel because of me.

501
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,320
My legs are very strong.

502
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,800
As long as you are all right, I can spare these knees.

503
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,770
But I'm not all right, though.

504
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,190
Because of my knees?

505
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,110
Then you can just brew restoration medicine for my knees.

506
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,600
With all your heart.

507
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,970
Sure, with extra deer antlers.

508
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,280
Then shall we return from here?

509
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,650
Are you looking for me?

510
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,200
You dare to dishonor me

511
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,180
and dishonor the Royal Family?

512
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,520
How did you people know?

513
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,890
 Physician Yoo, take a look at this. 

514
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,710
 Someone lit incense. 

515
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,520
 Try smelling this. 

516
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,670
 This is the scent of lilies? 

517
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,970
 Yes. Someone made incense out of a poisonous plant. 

518
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,230
 I received a letter from Jo Tae Hak's ghost. 

519
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,790
 Jo Tae Hak's ghost laid a curse. 

520
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,900
 Your Majesty, 

521
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,900
 why are you doing this? 

522
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,540
Who is it?

523
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,950
Who is behind you?

524
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,980
There is no one like that.

525
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:39,540
There are people who simply still follow His Excellency, Jo Tae Hak.

526
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,490
You bastard!

527
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,420
Put him in jail immediately.

528
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,760
I shall take my time questioning him further.

529
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,570
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

530
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,610
It is not over yet!

531
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,950
His Excellency Jo Tae Hak's spirit will take revenge!

532
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:02,500
 You shall not sleep peacefully for the rest of your life! 

533
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,120
Your Majesty, please return to bed.

534
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,350
I will brew some ahnsimsan.
  (Medicinal herbs to calm the heart) 

535
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,290
I'll leave it to you.

536
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,090
How did you know it was that man?

537
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,770
The night His Majesty saw the apparition,

538
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:39,320
the Princess also said she saw the apparition.

539
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,680
 A ghost! 

540
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,180
The princess originally dwelled in Boknyeongjeon, near the Queen's Pavilion.

541
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,350
However, she still saw the apparition right away, even though she moved her quarters.

542
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:56,850
The ones who knew the Princess moved near King's Royal Chamber were

543
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,210
the people who were present that day.

544
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,500
 His Majesty and the Princess. 

545
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,980
 The court lady who escorts the Princess...   and... 

546
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,220
 the only person who could light incense. 

547
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,540
Eunuch Yoon.

548
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,810
How did you think of all that?

549
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,670
You are quite incredible.

550
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,270
 I... am not going crazy? 

551
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,610
   

552
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:46,610
 We found signs of a poisonous plant being used as incense in front of your bed-chamber. 

553
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,540
 It was neither an apparition nor your imagination. 

554
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,000
 Therefore, Your Majesty is not going crazy. 

555
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,240
 Someone started the rumor that the ghost of Jo Tae Hak appeared to incite fear 

556
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,430
 in order to get to Your Majesty's head. 

557
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,210
 In order to catch him, for now, 

558
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,700
 Your Majesty must act as if your condition has worsened. 

559
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,710
 Leave at once! 

560
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,530
 Please make it seem 

561
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,660
 as if his plan succeeded. 

562
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,620
Do you think the poisonous plant was the only problem?

563
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,500
What do you think it was? The thing I saw.

564
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,910
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

565
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,490
I think it was Your Majesty's emotions.

566
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,370
What can...

567
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,120
I do to get better?

568
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,370
Your Majesty's emotions

569
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,900
are not a sickness.

570
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,930
 You must first work to save the palace ladies. 

571
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,750
 Your desire to save your people, 

572
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,020
 your desire to protect the palace ladies. 

573
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,630
The feelings of a King who worries about his people

574
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,120
and the safety of his civilians.

575
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,940
How could the feelings of a father worried about his children

576
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,240
be considered a sickness?

577
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,180
Please make sure to take care of

578
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:41,190
Your Majesty's strong and steadfast feelings as well.

579
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,480
The cause of the collective illnesses has been revealed.

580
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,300
Thus, I would like to recognize

581
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,040
Physician Yoo Se Yeop and Gye Ji Han for solving this case.

582
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,310
That must not happen, Your Majesty!

583
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,020
Before that,

584
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,150
it would be appropriate to question them first.

585
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,960
Your Majesty,

586
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,810
their crimes have been blatantly recorded.

587
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,690
Who the hell are all of you?

588
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,990
This is the order of the court to arrest you all.

589
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,360
Arrest?

590
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,590
Did I hear wrong just now?

591
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,210
What nonsense is this?

592
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,010
How could you all be so ungrateful? Huh?

593
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,840
You worked us into the ground when it was urgent,

594
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,170
and even milked us out of medicinal costs. What now?

595
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,100
Arrest us instead of rewarding us?

596
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,380
Exactly!

597
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,870
You should pay up for the medicine you freely took from us.

598
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,030
Insolence.

599
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,250
Hey!

600
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,150
Don't be afraid, everyone. Square your shoulders!

601
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,910
You don't get punished after saving people's lives!

602
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,530
Got it?

603
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,210
Aigoo.

604
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,170
Look at this. This is what happens when you work for the government.

605
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,750
Aigoo, I mean, look at the generals* who served their country.
 (Jang Goon means general) 

606
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,480
- Me? 
 - No, not you.

607
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,140
If they haven't lost their lives... How do you put it?

608
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,410
- They should count their blessings. 
 - Count their blessings.

609
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,230
I don't think Hanyang suits me.

610
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,300
Please shut down Gye Soo Clinic for performing false medicine,

611
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,180
and banish Yoo Se Yeop!

612
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,120
If Your Majesty defends those wicked people again,

613
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,860
the physicians of the Royal Clinic will all resign.

614
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:35,440
 Your Majesty, please listen to our plea! 

615
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,240
There was another true cause for the palace ladies' illness.

616
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,140
It was anxiety.

617
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,150
The anxiety of the Royal Clinic, who could not acknowledge their misdiagnosis.

618
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:04,270
That anxiety is what exacerbated this whole situation.

619
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,340
What are you talking about?

620
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,760
The Royal Physicians' cowardice and fear of their blunder being revealed

621
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,340
was what fostered the sickness.

622
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,920
Does the Royal Clinic exist to save lives or to stay alive?

623
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:29,410
Your Majesty, I do not need anything.

624
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:32,980
Please grant me permission to leave Hanyang.

625
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:42,350
As you all desire,

626
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:45,320
I shall shut down Gye Soo Clinic in Hanyang,

627
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,640
and banish Yoo Se Yeop to Sorakhyeon.

628
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:59,240
However, I shall designate to Yoo Se Yeop and Gye Soo Clinic

629
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,640
Royal funding and a nameplate* 
  (The hanging signboard for official locations) 

630
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,400
for their great contributions to solving the case.

631
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,340
Thus, I order you

632
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,720
to look after the suffering of my people with fatherly love.

633
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,600
It must not be so, Your Majesty!

634
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,010
 Please deliberate on this matter, Your Majesty! 

635
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,060
I am the one writing the nameplate,

636
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,780
and the Royal Funds belong to the Royal Family.

637
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,340
How are you telling me I cannot?

638
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,830
If you're opposing just for the sake of opposition,

639
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,310
I shall grant all of your resignations,

640
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,690
so do what you want!

641
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:48,510
The fact that I must send you off again like this

642
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,250
pains me to do so.

643
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:58,300
How could you grant our clinic such a great reward?

644
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,510
Why do you only consider it a reward?

645
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:06,040
Now, you must come to me whenever I call for you.

646
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,960
I have placed a ball and chain around your ankle.

647
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:15,180
Your Majesty, your grace is boundless.

648
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,000
I hear you're

649
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:39,400
still unmarried.

650
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,330
I do not understand what you are saying.

651
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:49,160
Why have you not married yet?

652
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,140
Wait, I do not need to hear it to know.

653
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,760
Because of your feelings for me?

654
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,110
What feelings?

655
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,430
I shall bestow an exceptional decree upon you.

656
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,270
- You must become  my– 
 - I do not know what kind of decree it is,

657
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,960
but I will be leaving Hanyang soon.

658
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:12,450
I apologize, but I am afraid I cannot carry out your decree.

659
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,530
You are leaving Hanyang? Why?

660
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,630
If you hear me out, all thoughts of leaving will vanish.

661
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,980
I...

662
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,450
shall...

663
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,370
marry you.

664
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,140
I think

665
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,750
I misheard.

666
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,100
You heard me! Are you pretending you did not?

667
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,330
I have a house in Sorakhyeon,

668
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:59,080
and I have much to do in the clinic there.

669
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,240
So, please retract your decree.

670
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,350
Did I just get rejected?

671
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,060
Yes.

672
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,410
You have been rejected

673
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,130
in the most grandiose way.

674
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,510
How could I?

675
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,460
Have you seen Lady Eun Woo?

676
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,240
What? Wasn't she with you at the palace?

677
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,720
You know, if you think about it,

678
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,510
My Lady leaves without a word so easily.

679
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:56,470
- My Lady is quite– 
 - She doesn't care at all about Physician Yoo.

680
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:58,480
- That's what Man Bok– 
 - That's what Jang Goon said.

681
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,560
- It is not. 
 - It is.

682
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,780
Hey, you!

683
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,420
You... Void your friendship with His Majesty.

684
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,420
There's never a peaceful day.

685
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,810
Punishing me, then rewarding me.

686
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,490
Are they toying with me or something?

687
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:15,430
We managed to wrap things up this way because His Majesty stopped them.

688
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,860
Do you think I don't know that?

689
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,730
I'm just saying it's bothersome to become entangled with the Royal Family.

690
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:26,250
Gosh, our lives as physicians will be a thorn field now.

691
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,020
Damn it.

692
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,740
 I told you to clean up after yourself! 

693
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,090
 Hurry up, hurry up. We need to go. 

694
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,600
Lady Eun Woo.

695
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,510
I thought you had left.

696
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,470
Without saying goodbye?

697
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,830
I am not that kind of person.

698
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,170
Exactly.

699
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,850
You are not.

700
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,670
However,

701
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,260
I do need to say goodbye now.

702
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,180
Are you returning to

703
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,030
Heuksando with your father?

704
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,690
Please don't go.

705
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,850
How can we be apart again?

706
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:11,600
Can you... bear to do that?

707
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,960
♫  Have you noticed the wind blowing?  ♫

708
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,330
You do not want to leave, either, do you?

709
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:22,500
You want to see Gye Soo Clinic again, don't you?

710
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:27,630
♫  As I look at you with trembling eyes  ♫

711
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:31,830
Then, here and now, choose just one.

712
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,180
Choose what?

713
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,230
Is it me

714
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,280
or Ixeris repens*? 
  (A Perennial found in East Asia) 

715
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,920
♫  Little by little, I can engrave you in my heart  ♫

716
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,230
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫

717
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:53,080
Surely, I won't lose to Ixeris repens?

718
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,650
Not at all.

719
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,080
No.

720
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,060
It is just that...

721
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,610
my father's will is too firm,

722
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:05,640
so I barely got to come out even now.

723
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,920
♫  I wish and hope every night, when I open my eyes one day  ♫

724
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:20,230
♫  I want to embrace you as you are  ♫

725
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,340
Try it.

726
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,010
Oh, this...

727
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,540
This is delicious.

728
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,210
Is it delicious?

729
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,940
Ip Boon!

730
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,730
Say that I am not here!

731
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:01,300
Those girls are the ones who ripped off my money, right?

732
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,070
I'm glad you girls are here today!

733
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:06,050
I will mince you all up today!

734
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:09,170
Hold yourself back. Those unnies are really scary.

735
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,350
Give back Ip Boon Noona's money.

736
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,990
Ip Boon Noona lost her dream

737
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,120
because of you, fraudulent Noonas.

738
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,380
That's right!

739
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,190
I thought you were good unnies.

740
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,490
Ip Boon, we are so sorry.

741
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,500
I am paying you back exactly three times,

742
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,220
so do not say otherwise later.

743
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,160
Hey, we paid you back entirely, okay?

744
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,240
Were Jang Goon and I that scary?

745
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,380
We were intimidating.

746
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,660
- Ip Boon! 
 - Yes?

747
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,830
When you are doing what you love,

748
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,860
you lose sight of everything.

749
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,020
That is why you also make mistakes, okay?

750
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,540
You better not become discouraged!

751
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,090
So, in other words, when you're in Hanyang

752
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:32,660
just know you can get conned in a blink of an eye,

753
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,730
so don't trust anyone so easily like that.

754
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,040
You know what? Don't even think about coming to Hanyang.

755
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,460
Answer me!

756
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,150
What has gotten into you?

757
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,860
Laying your voice low and all.

758
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,250
O-Oh, the pear went down the wrong way.

759
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,080
You cannot do that!

760
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,080
How can you just let him go?

761
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,320
Then what can I do?

762
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,400
He said he did not need anything.

763
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,110
I just granted what my friend wished.

764
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:13,210
Then what about your only younger sister's wish?

765
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,880
What are you so unhappy about this time?

766
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,760
I cannot let him go!

767
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,650
I cannot let that man, Yoo Se Yeop, go.

768
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:24,620
What are you going to do, then?

769
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,400
Gosh, I could have totally ruled Hanyang.

770
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,840
Hey! Don't even look in that direction.

771
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,930
Oh, why not?

772
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,220
Gosh.

773
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:56,570
Stop. Don't dare bow, bid farewell, and stuff, you piglet.

774
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,500
Don't do it.

775
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,440
Castor Bean Hyungnim!

776
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,350
Please be healthy!

777
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,690
Yes, you all go on ahead.

778
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,800
This thing came undone. Yes.

779
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,160
Let's go.

780
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,710
Wait for me!

781
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,940
Aigoo, aigoo.

782
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,090
You can eat this.

783
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,590
But it is not a castor bean plant.

784
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,680
Aigoo, Granny, come here.

785
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,400
Really?

786
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,630
Do you know me?

787
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:03,270
How come Poong does not know?

788
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:07,180
I'm dying to know why.

789
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:22,050
Physician Yoo!

790
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,540
Physician Yoo!

791
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:43,240
Physician Yoo!

792
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,620
One moment, please!

793
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,740
Physician Yoo!

794
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,050
Physician Yoo!

795
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,200
Aigoo.

796
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,700
- Lady Eun Woo. 
 - Physician Yoo.

797
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:22,320
Please let me go with you.

798
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,070
What about County Magistrate Seo?

799
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,670
I got permission from my father.

800
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,480
I am so glad.

801
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,720
I am really so glad.

802
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,290
- Let go. 
 - Okay.

803
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:55,500
- Let's go now. 
 - My eyes are getting sore from watching them, seriously.

804
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,890
- Come on, let's get moving. 
 - Okay, okay.

805
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:00,120
Let us go. Aigoo.

806
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,860
Hurry up and come!

807
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:33,970
♫  Your sweet words  ♫

808
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,130
 I am excited because you are coming with me. 

809
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:41,220
 I am happy. 

810
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:45,240
 I am a little afraid. 

811
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,610
 What are you afraid of? 

812
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:52,480
 That you might lose everything because of me, Physician Yoo. 

813
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,310
 As long as you are by my side, I am okay, Lady Eun Woo. 

814
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:59,760
 Is that not true for you, Lady Eun Woo? 

815
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,920
 It is. 

816
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,380
 I... feel like I am breathing and my heart beats 

817
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,460
 only when I am next to you. 

818
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,300
 I wish this road was just a little longer. 

819
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:16,840
♫  I will take the first step toward you  ♫

820
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,460
Stand in a line, everyone!

821
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,120
This side is for acupuncture and

822
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,440
this side is for medicine!

823
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,110
- Stand in a line, please! 
 - Try it, please.

824
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:33,340
Stand in a line, please!

825
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,320
Seriously, what did you eat wrong this time?

826
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,110
Let me feel your pulse.

827
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,090
All right, let me see.

828
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,870
Gosh, you ate something late at night again.

829
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:47,500
- Make way! 
 - Make way!

830
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,480
- Make way! 
 - Make way!

831
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,250
Where does it hurt?

832
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:25,770
Take everything here and throw them out.

833
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:27,290
 Yes! 

834
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,390
- Why are you doing this? 
 - Oh, my, Jang Goon!

835
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:38,110
- Move back! 
 - Wait...

836
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,500
Wait, what is all this—

837
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,050
Pardon me. Please make way for us.

838
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,930
What is going on here?

839
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:56,570
Your Highness the Princess?

840
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:05,700
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫

841
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,090
♫  This shouldn't be difficult  ♫

842
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:12,540
♫  There's one that I can't endure  ♫

843
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:16,190
♫  Only one thing I can't endure  ♫

844
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,500
♫  I wish and hope every night  ♫

845
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,950
 How dare you dirty me, the princess of this nation! 

846
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:25,380
 Take responsibility for your actions! 

847
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,530
 This is a Royal Decree! 

848
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:29,600
 Gye Soo Clinic will be closed indefinitely! 

849
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,360
 He's trying to act like a mother-in-law 

850
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,170
 with that yellowed piece of paper. 

851
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:38,170
 I am confident, so worry about yourself now. 

852
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:41,150
 Physician, what kind of person are you, exactly? 

853
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,590
 So Cheon! 

854
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,250
 They said So Cheon disappeared. 

855
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,870
 What exactly did I do wrong? 

856
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:51,580
 Can you really call yourself a physician? 

857
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:55,030
♫  The only thing I can't lose  ♫

858
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,900
♫  Is this love  ♫
