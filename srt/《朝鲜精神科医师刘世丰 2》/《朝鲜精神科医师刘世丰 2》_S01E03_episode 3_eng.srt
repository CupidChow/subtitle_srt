1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,380

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,930

3
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,040

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,170

5
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,070

6
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,160
Where does it hurt?

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,360
Take everything here and throw them out.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,940
 Yes!

9
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,690
- Wait, what— 
 - Let's go!

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,200
- Why are you doing this? 
 - Oh, my, Jang Goon!

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,170
Move back!

12
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,530
Wait, what is all this—

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,580
- Move back! 
 - Wait...

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,130
What are you all doing?

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,400
We are in the middle of treating patients.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
Please stay put!

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,700
You little...

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,150
What has gotten into you?

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,050
Please stay put, I said.

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,250
You little punk!

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,620

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,550

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,800
By now, your neck should have been healed—

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,350
Wait,

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,280
how did it become like this again?

26
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,660
Were you not able to take care of it as I told you to?

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,880
Yes.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,450
Because I was busy, and it was too itchy.

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,730
But it got a lot better thanks to you, Physician Yoo.

30
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,860
Still, I thought it would have healed completely by now.

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,150
Do you have worries and concerns you keep to yourself?

32
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,530
I am the one to blame for this.

33
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,770
I used saltwater without even asking you.

34
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,160
So I apologize.

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,700
It must have been too itchy for you.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,740
Do not blame yourself.

37
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,640
Is the work at the paper mill too hard for you?

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,610
Overworking can also worsen your skin.

39
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,820
Not at all.

40
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,790
No matter how hard it is, I am happy because I am able to acquire

41
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,850
paper I can use.

42
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,710
I did hear that you write novels,

43
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,270
and they were so fun to read.

44
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,170
But why haven't you shown them to me once?

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,440
Well...

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,570
t-the thing is...

47
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,460
I am afraid you might be...

48
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,960
furious if you read it.

49
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,490
Me?

50
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,710
Wait, why would I be?

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,350
There is a reason for that anyhow.

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,960
One moment, please.

53
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,140
Would I?

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,240

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,590
Thank you so much.

56
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,440
Everyone was dying to read the next volume.

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,030
I am presenting it to you before anyone else, Young Lady.

58
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,350
I will enjoy it and spread the word far and wide.

59
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,350
Now then, please take care.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,210
Lady Eun Woo, do you also read novels?

61
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,300
While I was at Heuksando,

62
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,890
I read the ones Ip Boon sent me, and they pulled me in.

63
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,050
Could the story

64
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,380
possibly contain descriptions of So Cheon's circumstances?

65
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,870
If I read it, it might help with treating her worry—

66
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,600
Y-You cannot!

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,000
And why not?

68
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,380
Well...

69
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,530
the thing about you is...

70
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,790
that you are very busy, right?

71
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,980
There are six volumes prior to this one, you see?

72
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,340
I will read it and tell you about it.

73
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,190
Lady Eun Woo, are you going to

74
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,090
read it to me in your own voice?

75
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,940
Because I would like that.

76
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,850
Pardon me. Please make way for us.

77
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,140
What is going on here?

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,310
Your Highness the Princess?

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,380
What are you doing here right now?

80
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,130
What do you think I am doing?

81
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,070
Your Highness!

82
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,700
Compared to what you did to me, this is nothing.

83
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,460
How dare you dirty me, the princess of this nation!

84
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,560
Take responsibility for your actions!

85
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,540
D-D-Dirty...

86
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,770
A philanderer!

87
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,900
She's clean!

88
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,180
What are you trying—

89
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,790
What do you mean by that?

90
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,470
You are making everyone misunderstand.

91
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,520
Did you forget what you did to me that day?

92
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,380
 I... shall... marry you.

93
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,980
 I think I misheard.

94
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,140
What happened that day is—

95
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,410
Did I not clearly express my feelings?

96
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,020
Does His Majesty also know about you coming here?

97
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,320
This is His Majesty's will!

98
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,970
Jeon Kang Il?

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,100
You did great.

100
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,860
I will take care of things here.

101
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,290
I will meet you at the municipal office building.

102
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,290
Court Lady Jung!

103
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,130
This is a Royal Decree!

104
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,650
Show respect, all of you!

105
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,340
What?

106
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,250
- What are we bowing for? 
 - Hush, Granny.

107
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,920
King's Inspectors will see if you qualify to be a medical clinic under the Royal Family

108
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,770
and provide Royal Funding and a nameplate according to the result!

109
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,100
As such, fully cooperate with the inspection and

110
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,920
until it comes to an end,

111
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,880
Gye Soo Clinic will be closed indefinitely!

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,160
What?

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,950
Hey!

114
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,860
Are you the one giving out Royal Funding?

115
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,490
His Majesty is the one giving it to us.

116
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,800
Why are the Royal Clinic bastards evaluating us? On what grounds?

117
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
For example!

118
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,770
I heard you drink a lot of alcohol, Physician Gye.

119
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,580
By chance,

120
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,430
you do not drink when you treat patients, do you?

121
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,620
If that is true, then it is a massive minus.

122
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,070
Did you even go around investigating me secretly?

123
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,270
Gosh, these petty bastards!

124
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,980
Just like this, you will be graded to the finest detail.

125
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,430
So, brace yourselves.

126
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,240
Whether you receive Royal Funding or not

127
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,500
depends on this very grading chart.

128
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,590
What will he do?

129
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,560
He is going to grade us.

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,900
Gosh, this...

131
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,670
He is quite annoying.

132
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,970
How annoying.

133
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,670
Bullshit Gye* will take care of everything himself, 
  (Sounds like Gye Ji Han)

134
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,200
so do not worry.

135
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,720
- Yes, Your Highness. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,060
You will need to be prepared,

137
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,920
especially since you have many problems.

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,940
I am confident, so worry about yourself now.

139
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,320

140
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,720
 We cannot be seen, then?

141
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,130
 How can they do this?

142
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,790
Everyone, go home!

143
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,170
- Go home! 
 - This place has closed down!

144
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,130
Go back.

145
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,520
I came from afar, though.

146
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,490
Let us go.

147
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,800
Lady Eun Woo, this is that inspector's scheme.

148
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,260
They came down together to put me in a difficult spot.

149
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,900
I have never even met the Princess in private.

150
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,990
I swear upon the Heavens that I never did!

151
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,020
Sure.

152
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,890
But earlier, the Princess said,

153
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,140
"Take responsibility for your actions!"

154
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,400
Did she not?

155
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:27,110
Could it be that the Princess had received this before as well?

156
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,540
This—

157
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,390
How could you—

158
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,660
This is unfair.

159
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,440
I know that you did not do so.

160
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,700
You know?

161
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,920
Yes.

162
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,670
Lady Eun Woo, were you joking with me just now?

163
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,860
Hey, Half-Wit!

164
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,610
Stop being clingy and come here.

165
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,380
C-Clingy...

166
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,870
Gosh.

167
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,150
Aigoo.

168
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,600
Are you trying to let the inspector get the better of you again?

169
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Just quit drinking for a few days.

170
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
Inspector?

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,330
Why? Tell him to grade me on how many times I go to the toilet during treatment.

172
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,500
He's trying to act like a mother-in-law

173
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,260
with that yellowed piece of paper.

174
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,180
But I will not stand the sight of that.

175
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,540
We still have to come around somehow and reopen the clinic.

176
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,800
You are wrong.

177
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,700
If they filter so finely, every grain of sand will be caught.

178
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,610
Who here doesn't have any dirt on them?

179
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,770
Gosh, no matter how I look at it, he is doing that intentionally

180
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,350
because he has a grudge about something.

181
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,980
Say, what did you do with the Princess?

182
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,890
I did nothing.

183
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,720
- I am really innocent. 
 - I will keep it a secret.

184
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,280
Did you really not do anything?

185
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,860
Since meeting her and His Majesty when we were young, this is the first time seeing her.

186
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,300
The Princess and the Inspector came down together.

187
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,790
Doesn't that mean there is a link between them?

188
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,970
Either the Princess ordered it

189
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,130
or they plotted this together, you know?

190
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,730
Think about it before Gye Soo Clinic goes out of business.

191
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,060
The Princess, you, and Inspector.

192
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,300
Some kind of relationship

193
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,090
must exist among the three of you.

194
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,220
Yuck!

195
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,670
I do not want to stay in such a filthy place even for a minute.

196
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,080
Just give out the Royal Funding and bring me Yoo Se Yeop!

197
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,810
Since Royal Funding is the Royal Family's money,

198
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,780
should it not be used for the most righteous purpose?

199
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,140
For example,

200
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,840
a grand wedding for the Royal Family.

201
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,310
You sure know what you are talking about.

202
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,690
However, your humble servant is afraid our promise might get leaked.

203
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,600
If that happens,

204
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,950
how would you be able to capture Yoo Se Yeop's heart?

205
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,840
Are you blackmailing me right now?

206
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,650
How can your humble servant even dare?

207
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,150
I mentioned it just in case you might forget our promise.

208
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,940
You mind your own business!

209
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,050
You are the one who boasted we could go back to Hanyang with Yoo Se Yeop.

210
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,930
If you fail, I will cut off your neck.

211
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,020
 A royal medical clinic in a poor countryside village?

212
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,680
 In the end,

213
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,390
 His Majesty is trying to switch up the Royal Clinic with his people,

214
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,710
 dragging in Yoo Se Yeop and Gye Ji Han that bastard as well.

215
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,280
 You must ensure those two cannot even come near the palace ever again!

216
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,320
 I will get this job done.

217
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,730
 Do you have a plan?

218
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,920
 Before that, please promise me one thing.

219
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,130
 If I get this job done,

220
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,860
 please give me the position

221
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,560
 you hold right now.

222
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,580
 A measly being like you dares to push me off my seat?

223
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,570
 Not at all.

224
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,940
 I am saying I want to follow in your footsteps.

225
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,490
 Since you will be promoted to a higher position, Chief Royal Physician.

226
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,530
 Let me first hear about this method you have.

227
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,860
 Your Majesty,

228
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,370
 to designate a provincial medical clinic,

229
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,570
 you must first see if they qualify.

230
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,700
 Please send Physician Jeon Kang Il

231
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,060
 and let him process a fair and just inspection.

232
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,140
 We beg for your understanding.

233
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,020

234
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,770
The Royal Clinic's inspection team is regulating Gye Soo Clinic?

235
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,340
Gosh, but if they become a royal clinic, then His Majesty clearly likes them.

236
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,700
Why would they be regulated?

237
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,510
Gosh, why did the Princess have to come down as well?

238
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,300
I got it.

239
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,950
This means they got on the bad side of the higher-ups.

240
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,660
They're a target now.

241
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,620
Geez, I think I will get a headache from being here.

242
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,920
Right? This will not be beneficial for my future, will it?

243
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,920
This is kind of above my pay grade.

244
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,730
- So you don't know? 
 - Not really.

245
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,180
In that case, what do you know, exactly?

246
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,460
Does the Gye Soo Clinic have a lot of issues?

247
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,910
No, not at all.

248
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,720
It is the most famous clinic in this area.

249
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,160
Geez!

250
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,820
Royal Clinic's inspection team and the Princess...

251
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,300
I am about to have lots of issues right after my appointment.

252
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,150
Lots of what?

253
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,420
 Y-Your Highness the Princess.

254
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,860
You badmouthed me, right?

255
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,600
Lots of what?

256
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,530
Lots of...

257
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,040
Right.

258
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,390
I said your humble servant

259
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,230
is shedding lots of tears because he was touched

260
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,880
by how Your Highness the Princess

261
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,720
came all the way to visit this lowly place.

262
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,130
Court Lady Jung,

263
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,400
should we throw him out?

264
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,730
If you throw out the head of the municipal office,

265
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,200
then how will the work get done?

266
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,810
Please calm yourself down.

267
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,320

268
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,740
Gosh, seriously.

269
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,640
Please move aside!

270
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,080
Please let us in!

271
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,250
This is the only nearby clinic,

272
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,070
so what can we possibly do?

273
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,970
Dying from not getting treated and

274
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,700
dying from violating the Royal Decree are the same.

275
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,610
I cannot go back!

276
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,200
- Move aside! 
 - It is an order from above.

277
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,480
Now, now.

278
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,030
- Please go back. 
  - Aigoo.

279
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,180
- I cannot go back! 
 - Hey, hey!

280
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,320
- Aigoo. 
 - Go in, go in!

281
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,960
Move aside!

282
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,890
Report your findings.

283
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,330
Yes, Sir.

284
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,700
From top to bottom, this place is full of problems.

285
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,530
There is a child handing medicinal herbs,

286
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,510
hygiene problems, and an elderly with dementia.

287
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,690

288
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,550
What about our Jang Goon?

289
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,160
He is the best medicinal herb prodigy in all of Joseon.

290
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,440
And hygiene problem, you say?

291
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,500
Do you see even a speck of dust?

292
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,590
Do you know how meticulous Namhaedaek's hands are?

293
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,000
Try visiting the Royal Clinic and see if it is this clean.

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,340
I will be making the judgment as the inspector. Not you, Physician Gye.

295
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,220
Who are you to be judging me?

296
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,180
Before you were even born, I was already

297
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,010
running this place righteously for a long time on my own.

298
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,280
Physician Gye, you charge dramatically different amounts for each treatment.

299
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,550
You charge a golden toad from His Excellency Choi for a cold.

300
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,650
But you did not charge Choon Sam anything.

301
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,250
Is this the righteous management you mentioned?

302
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,950
Since His Excellency Choi can afford it,

303
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,300
I used expensive medicinal herbs, such as velvet antler and calculus bovis.

304
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,110
For the other patient, I used Ilmultang*. 
  (Treatment by using only one medicinal herb)

305
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,950
Those things are not in there.

306
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,700
Why? Because everything is inside my head.

307
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,400

308
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,010
You...

309
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:57,240
Fine, dust all you want. You will only realize what a waste of time this is.

310
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,740
- How did it go? 
 - Gosh.

311
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,250
That arrogant bastard.

312
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,870
His evaluation is too biased.

313
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,790
- Physician Gye! 
 - What?

314
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,040
I told you my Sol is sick.

315
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,670
My stomach is upset, and I keep going to the toilet.

316
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,360
I cannot treat you here. Follow me.

317
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,940
W-W-Wait.

318
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,650
How dare you?

319
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,420
- Move aside. 
 - You cannot do this.

320
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,790
What are you doing? Hurry up and show us what you got.

321
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,220
- Hurry! 
 - This little...

322
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,490
Aigoo.

323
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,900
Aigoo, why are you all doing this? My goodness.

324
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,110
Calm down, now. Calm down.

325
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,320
Hey!

326
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,600
You all heard what your boss said, right?

327
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,540
He said Gye Soo Clinic is closed until the inspection is finished, did he not?

328
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,020
It means only Gye Soo Clinic is closed.

329
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,710
It means I, Gye Ji Han, can keep treating patients.

330
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,270
Do you understand?

331
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,920
- Everyone, pack your stuff! 
 - Okay.

332
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,300
Get out of my way!

333
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,810
Move!

334
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,770

335
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,180
Let us go.

336
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,890
Arrogant bastards.

337
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,240
Continue witht the report.

338
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,970
Frankly,

339
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,530
this woman is also a problem.

340
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,820
She lost her husband and cut ties with her in-laws.

341
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,880
- How could a widow— 
 - What does that have to do with the inspection?

342
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,990
How can a widow dare to act like a physician?

343
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,230
She is not acting like one.

344
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,920
She is a physician.

345
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,650
A widow and a widower.

346
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,170
No one wished to become one.

347
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,350
The work we do is not to find personal faults.

348
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,270
We are inspecting to see if they qualify

349
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,510
to behold the Royal Decree.

350
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,310
Forgive me.

351
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,320
Please bring me this patient.

352
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,200
A skilled female physician is hard to find, even at the palace.

353
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
But you are flawless, Physician Seo.

354
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,250
I am still lacking a lot.

355
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,370

356
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,290
Barley*. 
  (Traditional hand game called "Barley, Barley, Rice")

357
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,080
Rice.

358
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,060
Rice, rice.

359
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,070
Aigoo, you are so good.

360
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,170
Please clean up everywhere, okay?

361
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,380
Does he think anyone can do this job?

362
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,440
Young Lady, are you okay?

363
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,110
I am okay.

364
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,920

365
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,240
What are you doing?

366
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,640
You are holding onto a busy person here.

367
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,440
There are many patients waiting for me.

368
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,900
I did not know that was the case.

369
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,080
 Sir, I brought the patient you ordered.

370
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,020
She is here, finally.

371
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,790
Lee So Cheon.

372
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,740
So Cheon!

373
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,470
Physician Yoo!

374
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,470
Show me your neck and arms right now.

375
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,940
My goodness.

376
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,120
They are horrendous.

377
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,770
What treatment did this physician provide for you?

378
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,220
Pardon?

379
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,070
Well, the thing is...

380
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,040
He gave me good medicinal herbs and—

381
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,620
With your weak stomach, you probably couldn't even consume the medicine well.

382
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,400
Before your affected areas worsened,

383
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,700
were there any treatments that this man provided?

384
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,640
W-Well, the thing is...

385
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,950
 Once the discharges all dry, I will apply rubbing medicine.

386
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,370
 Sopoongsan* should have stopped the inflammation. 
  (Medicine for inflamed and itchy skin)

387
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,310
 You cannot remove your shadow from yourself.

388
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,310
 Like you cannot remove your shadow, while the sun is shining,

389
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,100
 you cannot remove your heart

390
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,360
 from your body while you are alive.

391
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,140
 If your heart is suffering,

392
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,630
 then your body suffers with it.

393
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,310
 What do you think about using your bottled-up feelings

394
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,360
 as ink and move them onto paper?

395
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,520
 You do not need to show anyone.

396
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,560
 You can keep it to yourself.

397
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,850
 What do you say to write a story about yourself, So Cheon?

398
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,590
 I am ready to listen to your story anytime.

399
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,380
 Although I do not know what you have bottled up inside yourself,

400
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,200
 all of it has to be relieved

401
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,540
 that your wound and discharge to

402
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,310
 be soothed and calmed.

403
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,610
 A man, who used to work at the Royal Clinic,

404
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,590
offered a mere treatment of writing a story?

405
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,600
Renowned writers coped with their pent-up feelings by writing and reading poems.

406
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,320
Also, that child is not simply suffering from a skin disease.

407
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,350
How pathetic.

408
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,970
Treating skin disease with poems and prose instead of a medical book?

409
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,410
The previous king also suffered from pruritus.

410
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,230
Especially more during severe famines.

411
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,240
What do you think the cause was?

412
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,530
It was because of stress.

413
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,090
Stress, you say?

414
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,660
How can a king's worries and a mere citizenry's worries be the same?

415
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,830
Saying this child's skin disease is because of her worries?

416
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,460
Did you tempt the sick by giving out these ridiculous diagnoses?

417
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,550
This child would have healed already if you used blood tonics,

418
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,670
such as blood-producing emollients.

419
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,340
Those treatments were given out a long time ago.

420
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,650
You should review the medical records more carefully, Inspector.

421
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,990
So if your diagnosis of her heart being the cause was right,

422
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,070
then you should have treated it as well.

423
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,370
Can you say you treated her?

424
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,900
For a disease that takes time to heal, you need to know how to wait.

425
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,140
How can a physician rush a disease so hastily?

426
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,240
Let go of her hand right now!

427
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,740
How dare you try to teach a Royal Clinic inspector who was sent by the King?

428
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,690
So Cheon!

429
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,070
Move out of the way, please.

430
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,490
What are you doing right now?

431
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,770
- What are you all doing? 
 -  Yes!

432
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,380
Are you okay?

433
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,940
Y-Yes.

434
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,130
I am okay.

435
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,850
Oh, my.

436
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,760
He resembles Young Master in his prime.

437
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,910
And you still call yourself a physician?

438
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,680
While you were hesitant to place a needle,

439
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,040
a person almost died, did she not?

440
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,610
It is all cooked.

441
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,880
Starting with the ones who waited longer, take one, please.

442
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,100
I grilled a lot, so take your time, all right?

443
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,660
It is a lot more fun and nice compared to when you were at the clinic!

444
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,640
Please see patients here every day, okay?

445
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,260
Shall we? Should we have some pancakes tomorrow?

446
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,910
 Yes, yes!

447
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,380
Did you all come to stuff yourselves?

448
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,280
Are you trying to bankrupt our clinic?

449
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,950
We won't go bankrupt. We will become rich.

450
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,780
I told you there is no need to worry, didn't I?

451
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,690
Even if the clinic is closed down,

452
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,330
we will always find a way to make a living.

453
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,180
Killing two birds with one stone.

454
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,550
Gosh, so sour.

455
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,860
Hey, Sul's Father, come.

456
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,700
I think you really should not be doing this.

457
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,400
Aish.

458
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,900
You haven't seen the newly appointed governor's face, right?

459
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,550
His looks and personality are equally nasty.

460
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,400
Also, because of the inspection,

461
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,640
his attention is all on you.

462
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,040
How different can a new governor be?

463
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,250
They are all the same, more or less.

464
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,440
Physician Gye, he is different, okay?

465
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,350
He comes from a family of ministers and

466
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,090
his rich family is famous in Suncheon.

467
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,470
In addition,

468
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,420
there is a rumor that he had a younger brother, who tried to elope with a woman he loved

469
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,210
but was beaten to death by the governor.

470
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,760
What is the name of the new governor?

471
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,400
It is Ahn Hak Soo.

472
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,980
Ahn Hak Soo?

473
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,920
Are you sure that is his name?

474
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,330
Do you know him?

475
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,740
How would I know a person like him?

476
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,590
Aigoo, thank you.

477
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,290
- Where does it hurt? 
 - My knees ache.

478
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,340
- Aigoo. 
 - You're here?

479
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,690
Aigoo, my back.

480
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,990
These rotten bastards threw a ruckus of an inspection

481
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,700
not even letting us see patients.

482
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,780
Rotten bastards!

483
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,010
Is this not because you talked about Royal Funding and stuff, Father?

484
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,180
My goodness. You have a talent for creating problems where there aren't any.

485
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,040
Ip Boon, watch your mouth from now on

486
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,510
and don't wander around.

487
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:08,500
If someone asks about your mom's name...

488
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,070
Well, never mind.

489
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,180
Who would ever ask you?

490
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,380
Wait, if I cannot even talk or walk around outside,

491
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,210
then what? Should I just die?

492
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,750
Goodness.

493
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,020
Mark your father's words.

494
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,320
Even in Hanyang, I heard you almost wasted

495
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,290
Namhaedaek's money because you were full of hot air!

496
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,430
Why would you talk about that here?

497
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,520
Gosh.

498
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,770
You mind your own business!

499
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,180
Shit-stained Bullshit Gye.

500
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,550
Granny!

501
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,120
That kind of name fits

502
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,420
this guy way better!

503
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,640
What about So Cheon?

504
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,620
Don't worry. She is asleep.

505
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,460
Hey!

506
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,760
Do you remember what you did to the Princess now?

507
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,390
Whoa, I thought you were a half-wit,

508
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,400
but you actually had an outstanding ambition.

509
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,520
They say a fair face may hide a foul heart.

510
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,180
He is just living up to his decent looks.

511
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,940
- Philanderer! 
 - Philanderer?

512
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,140
Are you a philanderer, Physician Yoo?

513
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,840
What? W-Well, did I not say so?

514
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,740
My young master used to be like this with all the women in Hanyang.

515
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,830
Right. In the palace,

516
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,420
he made palace ladies, from here to there,

517
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,640
fall to the ground like autumn leaves—

518
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,210
Hey, you think I was some...

519
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,140
Lady Eun Woo,

520
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,010
my heart...

521
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,330
Aigoo, you lowlife.

522
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,790
- Philanderer. 
 - Philanderer.

523
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,140

524
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,420
Now, now!

525
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,410
A collection of all the wars that can happen between a man and a woman.

526
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,320
The deeds done by Poong, the main character!

527
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,070
The wind of romance, romance, romance.

528
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,080
Blowing away all the novels of this world in one shot,

529
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,230
the best romance novel of Joseon!

530
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,250
Come on in!

531
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,850
Your Highness!

532
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,550
How long will you be staying?

533
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,260
Four hours have passed already.

534
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,780
I thought you were afraid of getting punished for reading a mere novel.

535
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,180
No!

536
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,900
Sorry? What are you saying no to?

537
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,590
"I am going to reprimand you severely."

538
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,710
What did your humble servant do wrong this time?

539
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,900
"I am going to reprimand your heart so severely!"

540
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,980
"Otherwise, will you accept my feelings?"

541
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,450
Gosh, it is so fun! Too fun!

542
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,720
Gosh, why could I not have known this fun thing sooner?

543
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,510
Court Lady Jung, what were you doing all this time?

544
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,410
Yes. It is all my fault.

545
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,200
In the palace, I only got to read "Domestic Lectures" or "Biographies of Exemplary Women."

546
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,900
But it is not too bad outside the palace, either.

547
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,960
Especially the main character, Poong, here...

548
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,260
The way he tickles a person's heart is really...

549
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,410
I guess you would not know about these things.

550
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,160
Why would I not know?

551
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,000
I also have an aged crush in my—

552
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:33,500
That is right. I do not really understand.

553
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,890
This cannot do.

554
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,530
I will need to buy all the books here!

555
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,680
All of those books?

556
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,620
Especially this one. I love it so much.

557
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,340
Wait, who wrote this one?

558
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,540

559
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,620
Oh, Lee So Cheon.

560
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,530
Gosh, I love you, Lee So Cheon.

561
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,250
Okay. I need to go see Yoo Se Yeop now.

562
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,890
So suddenly?

563
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,540
I came all the way down here.

564
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,810
How can he not come see me once?

565
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,150
But I miss him.

566
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,030
Of course, I should go see him.

567
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,340
Your Highness, someone will hear you.

568
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,910
Physician Jeon!

569
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,210
One moment, please.

570
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,300
I did not expect to meet you here again.

571
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,990
I also did not even imagine you to be such a great physician.

572
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,420
I also did not know I will be meeting you again like this.

573
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,510
Are you talking about the inspection?

574
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,380
Physician Jeon, what...

575
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,730
What kind of person are you exactly?

576
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,490
Pardon?

577
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,460
I am

578
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,650
not sure about that.

579
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,340
 I am not on his side.

580
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,200
 I am a good person.

581
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,510
- You seem to be a good person...
-  The work we do

582
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,580
  is not to find personal faults.

583
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,390
and a righteous person, but...

584
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,590
 How dare you try to teach a Royal Clinic inspector who was sent by the King?

585
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,060
you are endlessly on the edge and cold-hearted.

586
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,920
Especially to Physician Yoo.

587
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,750
Could I ask you for the reason?

588
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,050
You always fail to meet my expectations.

589
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,930
I honestly thought you would say you are glad to see me, too.

590
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Before I am an inspector, I am also a physician.

591
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,030
I also wish for the patient to be treated and get better soon.

592
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,540
I would like for you to know that, at least.

593
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,680
What do you mean by that?

594
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,430
I am telling you, I will be doing a fair inspection from now on as well.

595
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,150
Wasn't this what you wanted to hear?

596
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,700
Looking at your medical records, I saw how skillful you are.

597
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,000
You will be saving many people.

598
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,340
It is thanks to Physician Yoo.

599
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,800
I also learned medicine from Physician Yoo.

600
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,280
What are they talking about for so long?

601
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,650
I thought she always stayed by Yoo Se Yeop's side.

602
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,170
Your Highness,

603
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,960
can we keep trusting that man, Jeon Kang Il?

604
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,650
She

605
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,710
is really getting on my nerves.

606
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,990
Should I tell her for you?

607
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,190
Aigoo, you were Her Highness the Princess!

608
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,190
What a coincidence.

609
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,980
Who are you, and why are you acting as if you know me?

610
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,050
I used to work at the Royal Clinic.

611
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,660
The handsome man, who was recognized even at the palace.

612
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,330
My face is unforgettable if you had seen it once.

613
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,150
He is just a physician

614
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,700
who had visited the palace with Physician Yoo.

615
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,390
Oh, you seem oddly familiar.

616
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,010
Have we met before?

617
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,860
Do you two know each other?

618
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,440
How could I know him?

619
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,830
A physician from the countryside.

620
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,200
Gosh, what do you mean "from the countryside"?

621
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,310
It is more profitable than at the Royal Clinic.

622
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,320
What did my Half-Wit do to you, Your Highness?

623
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,890
I will go and reprimand him!

624
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,480
Half-wit?

625
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,070
Why is Yoo Se Yeop a half-wit?

626
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,710
Oh, perhaps

627
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,300
have you grown feelings for him?

628
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,560
He is the one who had feelings for me first.

629
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,130
I am...

630
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,740
I am Yoo Se Yeop's first love.

631
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,480
Just as I thought!

632
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,740
I knew it was like this.

633
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,180
Your Highness, do not worry about a thing now.

634
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,470
I will resolve his feelings and everything, no problem.

635
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,080
Firstly though,

636
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,120
if you will go back to Hanyang with those inspectors—

637
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,580
He is all talk and no deed, Your Highness.

638
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,240
There is no need to listen to him.

639
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,410
Aigoo, why would you say that?

640
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,090
You do not even know me that well.

641
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:17,440
From kind words, a warm heart comes out.

642
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,440
That is how you can gain the other person's trust.

643
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,450
If you talk about kind words, Physician,

644
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,410
then everyone would scoff.

645
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,060
Kind words?

646
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,880
What is that?

647
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,970
The weather is so nice, isn't it?

648
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,720
You said you used to work at the Royal Clinic.

649
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,240
Did you do something wrong to Court Lady Jung?

650
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,500
Why does she hate even seeing your face?

651
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,310
Oh, is it natural as a countryside physician?

652
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,910
Kind words, please.

653
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,110
I am not sure.

654
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,430
I guess she is shy whenever she sees a handsome man.

655
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,610
I said I could escort her to the municipal office by myself.

656
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,120
Why do you keep following us?

657
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,010
- Well, I... 
 - Gosh!

658
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,970
Wait, did I really make a mistake before?

659
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,470
Did I borrow money from you?

660
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,290
What is this situation?

661
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,400
I think I saw it often in the novels.

662
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,900
Are you able to regain your senses?

663
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,470
Physician Yoo,

664
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,510
I put you in a difficult spot.

665
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,300
I am deeply sorry.

666
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,150
Difficulties you experience in life

667
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,000
become all fertilizer for your growth,

668
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,470
if you are the bigger person.

669
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:01,440
So, there is nothing to worry about as far as I am concerned.

670
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,850
Only if you recognize me as the bigger person, So Cheon.

671
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,770
Physician Yoo.

672
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,870
Or do you not?

673
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,100
Do you think of me as a petty human?

674
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,910
How could I possibly do that?

675
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,870
You are such a big person that

676
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,920
I always rest under your shadow.

677
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,630
You are really good with words.

678
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,810
You are fated to be a writer.

679
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,980
I am sorry, Physician Yoo.

680
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,630
I am...

681
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,630
I will try to be braver.

682
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,590
Okay.

683
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,810
Have you decided on something you want to do?

684
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,580
As you told me, Physician Yoo.

685
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,570
I am writing a story about myself.

686
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,520
A story that only I can read.

687
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,780
Okay.

688
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,010
Your illness will also get better soon.

689
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,870
What could be the reason for her skin's tedious recovery?

690
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,940
Let us go to the paper mill where So Cheon works tomorrow.

691
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,870
Why go there?

692
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,790
Because there is no other reason for her symptoms to worsen.

693
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,940
Whether the work at the mill is too tough

694
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,140
or if there is another reason.

695
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,080
I must go and check.

696
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,060
Okay. I think it is a good idea.

697
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,880
Physician Yoo!

698
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,090
Physician Yoo!

699
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,720
Physician Yoo, please come out!

700
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,890
Physician Yoo, where are you?

701
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,100
H-H-Hurry up!

702
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,860
What is wrong?

703
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,020
Physician Yoo, is So Cheon not at the clinic?

704
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,530
Why do you ask?

705
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,640
She is So Cheon's friend at the paper mill, Jeong Soon.

706
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,920
She said So Cheon disappeared!

707
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:04,170
Calm down first, and please explain more in detail.

708
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,090
Since there was a lot of work that day,

709
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,530
I went to the paper mill first thing in the morning.

710
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,470
I could not forget So Cheon's face when she left without saying a word.

711
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:17,760
She looked like someone who made a big decision.

712
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,570
 So Cheon—

713
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,870
Do you mean she did not go home?

714
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:38,170
We came here after checking her home and everywhere she might be.

715
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,190
Ever since a few days ago,

716
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,490
she said, "Living like this is too exhausting."

717
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,400
So Cheon could not have had bad thoughts, could she?

718
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,870
Everyone thinks of So Cheon as a family.

719
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,380
If she really left like this and met a bad end,

720
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,760
I cannot live on...

721
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,410
- Hurry up and bring her in. 
 - Yes.

722
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,260
Lady Eun Woo.

723
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:41,110
I could not tell her otherwise.

724
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:46,670
 So Cheon could not have had bad thoughts, could she?

725
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,820
 I knew I should not

726
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,050
 but I had bad thoughts at the moment,

727
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,130
 so I could not answer her.

728
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,850
I found myself to be so pathetic for having those thoughts.

729
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,730
You are not pathetic.

730
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:10,070
Because that thought also came from your concerned heart.

731
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,320
Instead of blaming your thoughts,

732
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,240
we just need to do what we must.

733
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,550
I will try visiting So Cheon's house again.

734
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,800
She might have come back.

735
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,820
So please look after So Cheon's friend.

736
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,240
Please do not overexert yourself.

737
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,520
Let me play with you.

738
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,590
- Sure! 
-  Okay.

739
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,290
I will make it really sturdy.

740
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,670
What is that?

741
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,070
M-Mother!

742
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,010
Mother!

743
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,790
Father!

744
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,610
Miss.

745
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,910
Are you okay?

746
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,550
Miss!

747
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,090
Physician Yoo, what about our So Cheon?

748
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,140
Everyone is still looking for her.

749
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,430
So try to hang in there a little more.

750
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,170
I should have taken care of her more carefully.

751
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,530
Please do not say that.

752
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,320
I heard you and everyone here

753
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,990
took really good care of her.

754
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,650
 Hey, take this and eat at home.

755
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,360
 Thank you.

756
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,100
 - Let's go. I will escort you home. 
 - Yes, yes.

757
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,340
 Hurry up and go.

758
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,080
 Let's go. Yes.

759
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,820
 So Cheon was a strong child.

760
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,970
So she will be fine.

761
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,960
You should rest more.

762
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,330
We will find So Cheon, so do not worry too much.

763
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,150
These are things that So Cheon had used.

764
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,290
I brought them just in case they might help.

765
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,720
Of course, they will help.

766
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,410
You did really well.

767
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,780
She covered the paper with ink.

768
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,360
Why did she do that?

769
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,210
She seemed to be writing something diligently for a while

770
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,570
but covered everything in ink like that.

771
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,010
Perhaps,

772
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,800
she planned to end her life back then.

773
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:20,340
I should have asked one more time.

774
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,530
I should have persisted and asked her what was wrong.

775
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:29,910
I do not even deserve to be her friend.

776
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,760
Do not think like that.

777
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,340
 Young Master. Young Master!

778
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,700
So Cheon!

779
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,980
What happened to her?

780
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,950
Lay her down here first.

781
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,240
What happened to her?

782
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,180
The kids found her body by the riverbank.

783
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,110
She was still breathing, although weakly.

784
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,370
So I brought her to the clinic right away instead of the municipal office.

785
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,790
We do not have first aid pills!

786
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,590
I saved some omnipotent antidote.

787
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,250
Bring that to me and ginger water.

788
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,300
Okay!

789
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,430
Shall we move her into the room?

790
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,470
We cannot because her blood flow is too chaotic right now.

791
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,660
Namhaedak, bring warm water. Ip Boon, cotton blanket.

792
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,480
Granny, please get me a dry cloth.

793
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,240
 Stop right there!

794
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,240
Get that man out of there!

795
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,500
Back off!

796
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,990
What a relief. Her pulse is coming back.

797
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:53,920
What are you all doing? Get him!

798
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,890
What exactly did I do wrong?

799
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:03,460
Why are you interrupting the treatment of a patient in grave condition?

800
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,280
That patient tried to kill herself.

801
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,110
I will investigate the physician who treated her meticulously.

802
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,830
She tried to kill herself?

803
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:20,650
There is no way So Cheon would do that.

804
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,840
Before her illness got worse,

805
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,270
she would've been healed if she had received proper needle treatment.

806
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:27,450
You lost the window of time for treatment

807
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,810
and drove your patient to kill herself.

808
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,820
Needle treatment is not everything.

809
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,330
- Physician Yoo tried other treatments– 
 - Other treatments?

810
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,420
That mysterious treatment of the heart?

811
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,380
Is leaving her alone to end up in this state

812
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,590
a true treatment?

813
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,160
Drag this man to the municipal office at once!

814
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,480
I will conduct a special private inspection there.

815
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,420
Wait, wait.

816
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,600
Wait, Young Master. Wait a minute.

817
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,380
Wait a minute, please.

818
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,880
A special private inspection?

819
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,900
That's right! He was furious like this and took our Physician Yoo.

820
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,780
Without you there, Physician Gye, we couldn't fight against them!

821
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,830
Gosh, I went to a special house call in order to take care of our clinic.

822
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,960
We must hurry up and go rescue him!

823
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,540
I believe he has a personal vendetta against Physician Yoo.

824
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,620
Gosh, that inspector jerk.

825
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,170
I thought it was a formality, so I played along,

826
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,370
but he's crossing the line more as time passes.

827
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,430
I think we should go to the municipal office.

828
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,400
Whenever Physician Yoo meets the Inspector,

829
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,030
he becomes easily angry.

830
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,920
Yes, Young Lady. Let us all go.

831
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,290
Let's go.

832
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,710
That Jeon Kang Il jerk.

833
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,890
What? A grand wedding?

834
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,040
Give me a break.

835
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,030
How dare he treats the man I will marry like a criminal?

836
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,630
There is no way So Cheon would have thought to commit suicide.

837
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,960
How much longer should patients suffer because of your stubbornness?

838
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:26,120

839
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,100
 I have become one with my illness.

840
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,820
 I live because I cannot die.

841
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:36,060
 Now I will become one with the river

842
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,310
 and die because I cannot stand to live.

843
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:41,100

844
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,850
Her suicide note.

845
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,040
It was found with her body.

846
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:52,670
Young Lady, you cannot!

847
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,190
I have something to say!

848
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,240
Please open the door.

849
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,580
Move, man! Move, move, move!

850
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,190
- You! 
 - Come on now.

851
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:08,340
How dare a woman raise her voice at this hour at the municipal office?

852
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,970
Why don't you drag them out?

853
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,980
She is the daughter of the former governor.

854
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,290
What?

855
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,810
She is the daughter of the former governor.

856
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,890
Oh, I see. Gosh, that's who you are.

857
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,920
Well, then...

858
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,280
more the reason you should not step outside the women's quarters.

859
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,220
I thought you were a widow.

860
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,550
But she wears her hair in a braid.

861
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,650
You do not speak and behave in a proper way.

862
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,100
An innocent physician has been taken away.

863
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,720
Since when has the government office conducted an investigation so forcefully?

864
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,480
What is she... who is?

865
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,340
A-Are you criticizing me right now?

866
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,880
She is criticizing you! So what!

867
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,500
Aigoo.

868
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,770
You are the current governor who is newly appointed.

869
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,240
Gosh, my eyes have gotten worse with old age. I did not recognize you.

870
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,050
You are Sir Ahn Hak Soo, right?

871
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,600
I see.

872
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:14,220
You must be from that Gye Soo Clinic or Bullshit Gye or something, right?

873
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:20,360
I will hear you out since you also are a physician.

874
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,370
Please come in.

875
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,940
You will benefit the most when this inspection is over, Your Highness.

876
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,980
Turning my man into a criminal will benefit me?

877
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:14,020
What Yoo Se Yeop had said to you in the palace...

878
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,770
Do you remember it?

879
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:21,460
 I shall marry you.

880
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,210
 I have a house in Sorakhyeon,

881
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,970
 and I have much to do in the clinic there.

882
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:30,800
 So, please retract your decree.

883
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,770
Did you watch all that?

884
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,070
- Yoo Se Yeop thinks of this clinic in the boonies as his home and family. 
 - What?

885
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,900
What do you think will happen if you force those feelings away?

886
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:51,390
He will be more attach and will not leave it.

887
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,400
So, you must get rid of the foundation of his affection

888
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,370
and make him leave on his own.

889
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,840
- On his own? 
 -  Yes. On his own.

890
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,800
Yoo Se Yeop will become your man, Your Highness.

891
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,910
You do not need anything else other than his heart for you.

892
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:11,870
Are you saying you will make it so that Yoo Se Yeop will only adore me?

893
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:17,290
Is it not true that you want him that badly?

894
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,140
You can find another way!

895
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,310
How can you put my man behind bars?

896
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,640
But you must release him right away after your investigation.

897
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,420
Do you understand?

898
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,380
Physician Yoo.

899
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,830
Lady Eun Woo.

900
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,590
Stay strong.

901
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,690
You did your best to treat So Cheon.

902
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,560
Everyone who saw you treat her would know that it is true.

903
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,750
I am sure the inspector is mistaken about something.

904
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:00,080
He says there is a suicide note and it is cornering me.

905
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,640

906
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,770
 I will become one with the river

907
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:10,380
 and die because I cannot stand to live.

908
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:14,740
By chance, could So Cheon really have done that?

909
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,150
I cannot believe that at all.

910
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:20,290
She joked around with me right before that

911
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,980
and she laughed as well.

912
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,400
But this suicide note...

913
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,810
Something seems off, don't you think?

914
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:46,690
Day after day, you postponed treating patients who were in pain and imploring you.

915
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,980
All you did was talk about treating the symptoms.

916
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,240
You were not even capable of treating them

917
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,440
yet you pretended to be a physician. Do you admit that crime?

918
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,890
- Physician Yoo did his best– 
 - Physician Yoo is the one who treated Lee So Cheon.

919
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,870
So I will hear directly from him.

920
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:09,640
To treat So Cheon's illness from its foundation,

921
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,050
I need time.

922
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,470
No.

923
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,800
Your arrogance ultimately killed the patient.

924
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,210
You did not focus on the patient who was in pain

925
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,410
but your way of treatment was most important to you.

926
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,440
Don't be bullheaded.

927
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,100
A physician who cannot save a patient.

928
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,100
Is he qualified to be a physician?

929
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:35,990
Can you truly call yourself a physician?

930
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,970
If so, show me.

931
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:51,720
Give the needle treatment right here.

932
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,410
What?

933
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,450
Are you not able?

934
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:13,750

935
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:24,880
♫  Where have you gone  ♫

936
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,950
♫  With your warm gaze for me?  ♫

937
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,600
 I no longer give acupuncture.

938
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,270
 You don't? You mean, you can't.

939
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,720
 So, it's indeed So Cheon's handwriting.

940
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,040
 As the physician of the heart, I will let So Cheon heal her own illness.

941
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,600
 If I cannot do so, I will give up everything.

942
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,530
 So, I can do something for you.

943
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:51,150
 In any case, why is Physician Yoo asking us to prepare a feast early this morning?

944
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:54,640
 You are totally thankful to me, right? You're speechless, right?

945
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,980
 All of us will help you.

946
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,040
 Could you please do me a favor?

947
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,130
♫  I will take the first step toward you  ♫

948
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:06,590
♫  You don't have to suffer so much anymore  ♫
