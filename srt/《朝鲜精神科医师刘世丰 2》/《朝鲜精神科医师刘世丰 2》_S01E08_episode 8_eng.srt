1
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,340

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,040

3
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,140

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,440

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,030

6
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,970

7
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,980

8
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,680
Why are you here, Physician Jeon?

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,920
What about you, Physician Seo?

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,590
I am going to see my parents.

11
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,190
How fortunate! I expected this trip to be lonely.

12
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,750
I am also going to Heuksando.

13
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,160
You are going to Heuksando?

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,520
What is the occasion?

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,990
Oh, I owe a favor to a patient there.

16
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,520
That's a long way to travel just for a patient.

17
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,370
I am a physician, after all.

18
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,460
The ship is departing soon. Hurry up on board!

19
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,340
Let us go.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Young Master, these are the Young Lady's favorite cookies.

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,460
Please share it just between you two.

22
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,090
Breakfast will be ready soon.

23
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,060
Young Master.

24
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, my.

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,220
Aigoo, look at his sorrowful eyes.

26
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,210
Did something go wrong?

27
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,340
I have a bad feeling about this.

28
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,160
If you up and leave as well, will this situation resolve on its own?

29
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,440
- For now, we need to— 
 - Did you know about this already, Physician Gye?

30
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,790
There is no other path for the Young Lady to choose.

31
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,640
We do not know how many years it will take for the appeal letter to be dismissed.

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,190
I'll bring her back.

33
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,310
And over time, explain the annulment issue.

34
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,050
Do you not understand why the Young Lady left?

35
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,460
I do understand!

36
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,690
Because of me and because of what lies ahead.

37
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,680
If the Royal Clinic physicians latch on to you,

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,650
the Young Lady will be in trouble as well!

39
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,220
To women, even the slightest rumor can leave devastating wounds.

40
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,650
Right now, it's better to just let her go for a while.

41
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,750
No.

42
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,430
There's a time for letting go and a time for protecting.

43
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,910
Right now is the time to protect.

44
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,340
At least wait for the wound in your head to heal!

45
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,340
There is something I must ask of you.

46
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,930
What?

47
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,670
 I'll protect him from here,

48
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,800
 so I ask you to protect him there.

49
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,850
I am sure even His Majesty is not able to stop it at this point.

50
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,610
 I heard you are Yoo Se Yeop's colleague from the Royal Clinic.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,390
There are too many enemies around me, so where do I need to begin?

52
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,410
I guess I must go to Hanyang and start there.

53
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,790
All right.

54
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,930
 He will see to you soon.

55
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,130
What is it?

56
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,650
Hey! Bullshit Gye is escaping again!

57
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,280
Father! No! How dare you?

58
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,700
What is going on?

59
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,620
Why are there so many patients today?

60
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,030
Is the Birchwood Clinic closed for today?

61
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,630
I don't know.

62
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,440
Aigoo, was it the upset stomach from last time?

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,460
Whatever, it is a mix of everything.

64
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,310
Did something happen today, though?

65
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,480
I mean, the Young Lady and Inspector Physician have been nowhere to be seen since this morning.

66
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,090
I definitely saw Physician Yoo walking around earlier, but where did he go?

67
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,250
Forget about those punks.

68
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,810
Hey, Jang Goon, prepare cyperus and perilla leaf powder!

69
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,710
Yes, Physician Gye.

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,330
It is great.

71
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,310
Yes, it is a beautiful place.

72
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,410
Now, then.

73
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,850
Well...

74
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,300
Could I stop by your place later?

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,580
Because this place is unfamiliar to me.

76
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,130
Mother!

77
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,320
Dan!

78
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,290
- Young Lady! 
 - Eun Woo!

79
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,910
Aigoo, Eun Woo.

80
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,460
Welcome back!

81
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,280
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

82
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,320
I just came back because I missed you.

83
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,600
What about Sorak County?

84
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,540
You said a female physician is needed there.

85
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,080
I do not think I need to go back anymore.

86
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,350
In his last letter, Father said that this place's physician passed away.

87
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,420
Yes.

88
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,020
We were going by without a physician.

89
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,210
You came at the perfect time.

90
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,980
Aigoo, you lost so much weight.

91
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,220
We will need to kill a chicken for you.

92
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,280
Right?

93
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,810
Oh, I had the water boiling already.

94
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,660
How lucky for you, Young Lady!

95
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,690
- All right, go unpack your things and rest up. 
 - Okay.

96
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,410
Let us go inside.

97
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,860
 Physician Yoo.

98
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,770
This is for Physician Yoo.

99
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,340
 Eun Woo! Hurry up and come out here!

100
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,080
If you or I suddenly show up out of nowhere,

101
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,800
how much would Physician Seo's mother be shocked?

102
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,850
How strong! I thought there was a thief.

103
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,770
A virtuous man does not insidiously peek into someone else's house.

104
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,890
What, insidiously?

105
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,460
Do you know what insidious is?

106
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,230
Want me to show you what insidious really is?

107
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,230
I've seen my fair share.

108
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,250
Do you dare secretly follow Lady Eun Woo all the way to Heuksando?

109
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,540
Look at this fellow! I truly came for a house call!

110
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,470
You're the one who should stop being clingy!

111
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,730
You'd chase after her all the way to this island?

112
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,640
Gosh! I-I am injured right now!

113
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,810
How can a so-called physician be doing this?

114
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,430
Beating a sick person and all!

115
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,840
Physician Yoo and Physician Jeon?

116
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,800
Wait. What in the world are you two doing?

117
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,830
No, before that...

118
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,490
Physician Yoo, how can you be here right now?

119
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,330
My name is Jeon Kang Il.

120
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,780
I am a Royal Clinic Physician,

121
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,210
and I came on a house call for Ambassador Jung, whom I know from my days studying in Qing.

122
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,730
Oh, I heard his wife is quite ill.

123
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,910
I heard she came all the way down here for rehab.

124
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,220
That is true.

125
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,600
I came because he insisted that he needed me.

126
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,430
I am also a former Top Acupuncturist of the Royal Clinic.

127
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,930
Of course, I know you, Physician Yoo.

128
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,130
I see.

129
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,560
Gosh, you must be hungry from coming here.

130
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,310
Dan, let us cook the brood hen.

131
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,130
Yes, Madam!

132
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,070
Wow! I haven't eaten such a feast in a long time.

133
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,620
Mother, you are the best.

134
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,590
"Mother?"

135
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,180
You dare call her "Mother" in this situation?

136
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,600
When your stomach is weak and your face yellows,

137
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,980
Dongui Bogam tells you to cook chicken like this with scallion roots.

138
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,390
What?

139
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,620
But you're the weakest one out of us all.

140
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,440
Hurry up and help yourselves.

141
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,110
Whoa.

142
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,650
Where has "Father" gone?

143
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,500
He went out to the mainland for business.

144
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,180
Aigoo, I was hoping to have some alcohol with Father. This is really too bad.

145
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,720
Seriously, you should have come sooner.

146
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,170
The ambassador who invited you

147
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,300
has been consistently asking for a physician.

148
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,340
Your father was really harassed by him.

149
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,340
Here.

150
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,210
Please let me have it, Mother.

151
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,430
Mother,

152
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,710
- I took all the bones out. 
 - Huh.

153
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,810
W-Why are you giving this to me?

154
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,650
I told you to have it.

155
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,660
You went through the trouble of cooking it.

156
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,810
You should get only the best parts.

157
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,850
I got a lot of help from Physician Seo.

158
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,840
During my stay, I will pay her back for everything.

159
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,480
I see!

160
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,360
Do you like abalones, too?

161
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,930
Aigoo, of course. I can never have enough.

162
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,080
Thank you.

163
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,190
Here you go, Eun Woo.

164
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,490
I also like abalone.

165
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,750
Lady Eun Woo.

166
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,570
Physician Yoo,

167
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,880
why did you come here?

168
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,510
How can you come all the way here?

169
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,210
Why?

170
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,440
I came to get treated because it hurts.

171
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,430
Please take a look. I think the wound opened again

172
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,420
because Jeon Kang Il hurt it earlier.

173
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,350
Let me see.

174
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,880
How could you abandon your patient

175
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,670
when he hasn't even fully recovered yet? And you call yourself a physician.

176
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,390
You could have gotten treated by Physician Gye.

177
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,980
Why would you bother to come this far on a boat?

178
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,210
I bet you'll get even sicker now.

179
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,170
Because I'm sensitive,

180
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm rather picky with my physicians.

181
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,940
Is it so bad to want to be treated by you

182
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,500
when you know the nature of my wound the best?

183
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,390
Physician Yoo,

184
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,360
you know that we cannot be

185
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,650
staying together like this.

186
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,100
Physician Gye, you really hung in there today.

187
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,390
Look at how all the blood escaped his face.

188
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,630
His cheeks also caved in.

189
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,680
122 medical histories,

190
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,490
85 prescriptions.

191
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,640
We had the most number of patients today.

192
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, my.

193
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,250
We never had this many, even when all the other physicians were here.

194
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,180
You really went through a lot.

195
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
This cannot do.

196
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,100
Starting tomorrow, we will be on a break!

197
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,130
- Sorry? 
 - What?

198
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,510
Aigoo, was it that tiring? Enough for you to take a break?

199
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,660
To make Half-wit doing treatments again soon, we need to pull up our sleeves.

200
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,650
So starting tomorrow, collect a petition from all the families

201
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,050
that were negatively affected by Governor Ahn's prohibitory decree.

202
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,450
And use that to file a complaint.

203
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,080
As if Governor Ahn would accept such a petition when it's about him!

204
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,930
I am going to report to someone higher than him,

205
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,200
so do not worry about that.

206
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,870
Whoa, you had a plan all along, huh?

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,080
Lady Eun Woo!

208
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,920
Lady Eun Woo.

209
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,520
Lady Eun Woo, please let me go with you.

210
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,120
Please do not come, Physician Yoo.

211
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,460
Are you not going on a house call?

212
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,390
- If I come with you— 
 - You said you came because you are ill.

213
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,630
Please rest and go back down to Sorak County first thing tomorrow.

214
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,980
You need to take care of the annulment issue

215
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,960
and it's a critical time in many ways right now.

216
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,180
I do not think I can go until I am all better.

217
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,350
You keep getting hurt like that

218
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,960
if you are with me, Physician Yoo.

219
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,030
What if I am not with you?

220
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,680
Then two hearts will get hurt.

221
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Both yours and mine alike.

222
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,380
I do not want to see a precious person get hurt, either.

223
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,990
I will take my time to resolve the annulment issue.

224
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,410
It's fine if you're here to take a break,

225
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,880
but if you only came down to avoid me,

226
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,740
let's go back together.

227
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,990
Physicians!

228
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,860
You need to come with me, please.

229
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,780
Hurry up!

230
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,920
While I was out for a moment...

231
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,590
I mean, I still found her right away, but...

232
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,910
You did well.

233
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,120
Fortunately, she is not in a critical condition.

234
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,330
- Yes, she will wake up soon if she gets treated. 
 - Okay.

235
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,540
Shall we talk outside for a second?

236
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,990
Okay.

237
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,600
She hung herself?

238
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,470
How did it come to this?

239
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,800
Young Lady Seol Hwa will soon be sold to Ambassador Jung as a concubine.

240
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,790
But he came and started a ruckus, demanding her to give back some ring or something.

241
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,040
Wasn't this the place where the wife was sick?

242
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,230
The one who invited Physician Jeon.

243
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,920
Yes.

244
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,080
But he tried to take the ring back from his concubine?

245
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,110
From what I heard, he seemed to be taking back what he gave her.

246
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,000
It is obvious, those nobles.

247
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I guess he was in the heat for giving her his wife's ring.

248
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,800
Madam!

249
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,020
That girl... is she inside?

250
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,160
Yes.

251
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,080
Young Lady, you're awake?

252
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,640
You are doing this on purpose, aren't you?

253
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
Do it properly if you are seeking attention.

254
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,610
Why do you live like that?

255
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,940
You're denying who you are.

256
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,980
Be careful of what you say. Running your mouth as you please?

257
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,840
What?

258
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,430
Are you afraid I will become the madam of the house?

259
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,300
You should not be outside yet.

260
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,810
Bring her back inside quickly.

261
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,390
Yes.

262
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,150
Please head back inside.

263
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,970
That girl... will she die or something?

264
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,420
Do you wish her to die?

265
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,050
Because she will be a concubine?

266
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,680
She will not die.

267
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,550
She will be fine.

268
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,780
She would have been better off dead.

269
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,540
 We are on a break today.

270
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,880

271
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,290
 Urgent patients, go to the neighboring Birchwood Clinic.

272
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,980

273
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,980
Do you know why I specifically picked you to come to Hanyang?

274
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,830
What is the reason? What are you trying to do in Hanyang?

275
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,590
Aigoo, this is getting scary.

276
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,690
Background check.

277
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,320
- A background check? 
 - Yes.

278
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,280
I am trying to look into all the bastards who are harassing your master.

279
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,420
Not in a stupid way like Governor Ahn,

280
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,290
but in a very thorough and complete way.

281
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,740
Wait a minute.

282
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,320
If we just do that background search,

283
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,450
then will my young master not have to worry about that annulment or whatever?

284
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,160
That's why they're getting the petitions ready,

285
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,400
while we take care of the background checks.

286
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,670
What do you say?

287
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,730
Did you wash your hands completely from that world or

288
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,020
are you still a hotshot with them?

289
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,910
What are you talking about?

290
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,480
It is okay to bring out a dark past for a while

291
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,880
if it is for the sake of a brighter future.

292
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,850
Just hiding it is not the solution.

293
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,680
Physician Gye, you heard it from Granny, didn't you?

294
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,830
Aigoo, I heard you had to quit your job because of the prohibitory decree.

295
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,740
If you tell me all your hardships, we will listen carefully and submit a petition.

296
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,320
We are submitting it to the king.

297
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,940
The king will listen to all your stories.

298
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,310
Aigoo, thank you so much.

299
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,990
All right, the ones who know how to write, write it yourselves.

300
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,490
Ones who do not, take turns and come to me.

301
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,150
What is this?

302
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,560
You know how to write, Granny?

303
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,880

304
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,900
I am better than you, am I not?

305
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,510
Gosh, you are quite good at writing.

306
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,370
All right, what is your story?

307
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,080
I finally got a job at the market a while ago,

308
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,050
but I had to quit because the hours did not fit with the prohibitory decree.

309
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,240
I don't know what I can do to make a living starting tomorrow.

310
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,110
I am full of sorrow because of this unfair life.

311
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,260
I've heard this was a longtime problem,

312
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,750
but I finally got to come here.

313
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,130
And the female physician? I asked you to bring me a female physician.

314
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,760
There is a female physician.

315
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,910
I asked her to be taken to your wife's room.

316
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,460
Her skills need to be trustworthy to...

317
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,560
Her skills are very excellent.

318
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,290
So, I have a request to make of you.

319
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,540
Please go back and tend to Seol Hwa.

320
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,940
 Seol Hwa?

321
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,920
 Why do you live like that?

322
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,090
 You're denying who you are.

323
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,150
Please let me check your pulse since I am already here.

324
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,260
It is not common to be seen by a female physician on an island like this.

325
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,470
I said I don't need to be seen by a physician.

326
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,690

327
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,710
Look at these scoundrels.

328
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,910
They are full of themselves.

329
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,810
How dare they close as they please?

330
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,990
Chil Sung, will you go and bring me that quickly?

331
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,750
That is thievery, isn't it?

332
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,540
How dare you?

333
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,010
They might be scheming a treacherous crime, so I am trying to prevent it—

334
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,070
Just hurry up and bring it without talking back!

335
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,600
Gosh, seriously.

336
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,890
He can never be helped.

337
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,150
Here you go.

338
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,950

339
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,180
How can you rip it apart when we need to put it back?

340
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,110
How dare they go around to get petitions signed?

341
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,640
Arrogant bastards. Who are they trying to ruin?

342
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,940
They seem to be trying to help Physician Yoo.

343
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,600
You, you, you. You knew everything!

344
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,250
Gosh, where did Bullshit Gye go?

345
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,000
I heard he went to Hanyang.

346
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,770
I guess he went to meet His Majesty or something.

347
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,700
Really?

348
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,370
What about the inspector physician?

349
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,410
Well, that guy, I heard, went to Heuksando on a house call.

350
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,590
Why are you so irritating today?

351
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,270
The ambassador's wife and the courtesan.

352
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,360
Could they have known each other already?

353
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,800
What made you think that way?

354
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,630
The madam adamantly refused my treatment,

355
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,180
and insisted I tend to Seol Hwa instead.

356
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,590
She sounded like she was acquainted with her already.

357
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,910
Could she have grown unwittingly acquainted with her

358
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,710
as a result of the thorough investigations?

359
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,710
How do you know such stuff, Physician Yoo?

360
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,880
Of course, I know.

361
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,070
I, too, have grown acquainted with one such name...

362
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,710
Jeong—

363
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,080
Never mind.

364
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,740
Oh, my. Is she not that lady?

365
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,410
 The County Magistrate Seo's daughter!

366
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,190
 O-Oh, the widow who goes around saying she is a physician?

367
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,890
I thought she went back to her in-laws' house since she was not around for a while.

368
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,120
How shameless of a noble's lady.

369
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,740
Just look at her walking beside a man.

370
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,350
Let us just go, Physician Yoo.

371
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,880
There is a good place over there.

372
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:23,810
When I came here with my father a year ago,

373
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,240
I saw fireworks.

374
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,970
People who live here believe their wishes will come true

375
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,170
if they write their wishes and attach them to the firecrackers.

376
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,420
What wish are you going to write, Lady Eun Woo?

377
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,970
I have no wishes as of now.

378
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,350
Since my first wish came true already.

379
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,760
What wish did you write?

380
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,020
That I want to

381
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,540
see you again, Physician Yoo.

382
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,670
It all came true when I saw you again last time.

383
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,510
- So please— 
 - I understand, Lady Eun Woo.

384
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,340
As soon as that patient recovers,

385
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,940
I will go back to Sorak County.

386
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,950
This is a petition against the prohibitory decree.

387
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,430
This is a moving tale about Physician Yoo.

388
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:42,560
There are so many people who say they are indebted to Physician Yoo.

389
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,300
That is right. Our Poong is such a lawful person.

390
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,060
Whoa, Physician Yoo has a lot of supporters.

391
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,060
Still, Physician Yoo has a certain someone

392
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,260
whom he wishes to be his supporter, doesn't he?

393
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,960
That is why he followed her.

394
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,770
If he followed her all the way to an island,

395
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:06,080
he needs to throw a decisive blow, at least.

396
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,730
You know what islands are like.

397
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,270
If you are stuck on an island and fail to create romance,

398
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,250
it means you are a fool.

399
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,930
He's holding a perfect hand of cards,

400
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,290
but then folding it all!

401
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,630
Aigoo, what did I count up to?

402
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,470
The balance between yin and yang

403
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,070
is not that easy to be found.

404
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,320
Aigoo, why are you bringing yin and yang into this?

405
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,590
- You. 
 - You need to know about it, too!

406
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,780
 Since you already made a choice to spread a rumor,

407
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,670
 you may as well spread another one that's foolproof.

408
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,240
A rumor...

409
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,860
The best rumor of all is indeed a sexual rumor,

410
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,830
but this inspector physician has no sense of responsibility!

411
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,810
He merely suggests the idea, then leaves for Heuksando.

412
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,880
Does he think I cannot get by without him?

413
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,270
I'm sure you'll change your mind once you open it.

414
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,770
Wait, why is this here?

415
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,910
Is it not the same as your cherished ring?

416
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,040
Therefore, I took it away from that courtesan.

417
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,460
How dare a concubine use the same one as the wife?

418
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,290
You can just not take her in as a concubine, then!

419
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,260
You know that cannot be so.

420
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,780
Embracing such poor children like her is also

421
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,720
the obligation of wealthy families like us.

422
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,230
What is the matter, Dear?

423
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,200
I guess you are very jealous,

424
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,040
because I said I will have Seol Hwa for myself?

425
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,010
Only the female physician is allowed inside.

426
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,030
Since my wife has gone insane,

427
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,780
please make sure to put her to sleep.

428
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,240
It is up to the physician to decide whether she is insane.

429
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,710
Let's see after I check her pulse.

430
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,060
I will go see the courtesan house patient.

431
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,690
Yes, I will see you later.

432
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,490
Please leave.

433
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,240
I do not want you to see me like this.

434
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,160
 Taking away a concubine's ring?

435
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,690
 It is obvious, those nobles.

436
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,670
Is this ring not the ring of the concubine?

437
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,250
Was it a pair with yours, Madam?

438
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,940
Why does it matter to you, Physician?

439
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,610
- Wait, is this— 
 - Please take your leave now.

440
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,840
I don't need treatment.

441
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,700
That woman...

442
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,390
is she gravely ill by any chance?

443
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,410
Enough to die?

444
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,850
How is it that the two of you wish for the other to die?

445
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,940
Just tell Ambassador Jung instead of doing this.

446
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,520
That you do not want to go to his house.

447
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,240
Do you think it's that easy?

448
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,540
It would be better if I could go someplace far away instead.

449
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,560
You do not have a specific illness according to your pulse.

450
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,690
However, it is strange why you are in such pain.

451
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,970
You saw the green jade ring that the Ambassador's wife had, right?

452
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,180
Yes.

453
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,470
That is the one he took and gave her, wasn't it?

454
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,150
However, the ring that the madam was wearing,

455
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,110
was one of a pair, not just a single ring.

456
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,690
It did not seem like a common ring.

457
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,510
How did they happen to have one each?

458
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,110
What if

459
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,370
they had known each other originally?

460
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,270
She called Seol Hwa by name that time too.

461
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,920
Did Physician Seo use to wear these?

462
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,610
They are really cute.

463
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,030
Right.

464
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,950
She was even cuter back then.

465
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,570
She must take after your beauty, Mother.

466
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,760
She does take after me a little.

467
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,730
What took you so long?

468
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,150
I waited so we could do it together.

469
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,370
There will be fireworks soon.

470
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,650
If you write your wish here and attach it,

471
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,970
it will come true.

472
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,770
It is an interesting custom.

473
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,780
What will you write, Mother?

474
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,320
That is a secret.

475
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,320
What do you think about learning medicine more in-depth?

476
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,840
As long as you want, Physician Seo,

477
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,040
you can hone your medical skills in Qing.

478
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,490
That came out of nowhere.

479
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,420
What do you mean by that?

480
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,910
Don't be so surprised.

481
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,680
I mean, I can prepare a position for her in Qing.

482
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,750
Of course, only if Physician Seo wants to.

483
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Physician Jeong, you must think deeply of my Eun Woo.

484
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,110
 As long as you want, Physician Seo,

485
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:51,450
 you can hone your medical skills in Qing.

486
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,310
Going abroad to study in Qing,

487
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,270
might be a better path for Lady Eun Woo.

488
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,380
I was only thinking about myself.

489
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,300
Lady Eun Woo, what do we...

490
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,820
No, what do I...

491
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,900
What do I do now?

492
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,480
Huh? Really?

493
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,030
Tell me more in detail about that.

494
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,230
Well, so the thing is

495
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,090
I went on an errand and

496
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,360
there was a commotion about...

497
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,940
 Thank you.

498
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,750
Did you get anything from Mr. Choi's household?

499
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,820
Do not even ask. I got a bunch of stuff.

500
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,510
You can always trace a person's stench

501
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,960
by observing what they accuse others of.

502
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,520
The number of his secret concubines is...

503
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,790
Oh my, with just those alone, we could end him.

504
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,820
Should we not choose one and focus on that?

505
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,980
Who else are you trying to look into now?

506
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,930
- We are done with Mr. Choi now. 
 - Oh,

507
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,380
there is one.

508
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,520
The most important one.

509
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,910
Anyhow, when you are done, come to the courtesan house by the corner of the market.

510
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,670
We agreed to meet there.

511
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,360
Take your underlings and find dirt

512
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,130
from even the undergarments of the Royal Clinic Physicians.

513
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,210
- Okay? 
 - I'm off.

514
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,020
I stole this secretly.

515
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,390
Geez, it is in Chinese characters.

516
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,140

517
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,200
- You are following, right? 
 - Y-Yes, yes, I am.

518
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,650
Next up is Royal Clinic's Fourth Junior Ranking

519
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,910
Official Noh Yun Deok.

520
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,320
Noh Yun Deok... Noh...

521
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,140
Gosh, this one also had a lot of dirt on him.

522
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,520
If we hadn't done this background check,

523
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,390
then Young Master and I would've been oblivious

524
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,540
to the very fact that

525
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,520
there were so many thieves in this nation!

526
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,700
Hey!

527
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,450
Those shady men bow to you and respect you as hyungnim.

528
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,680
As if you'd live oblivious to all of that!

529
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,520
We are of a different breed than those grand thieves.

530
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,240
 That came out of nowhere.

531
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,320
 What do you mean by that?

532
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,650
 Physician Yoo!

533
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,040
Physician Yoo?

534
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,840
Physician Yoo!

535
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,380
Physician Yoo?

536
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,810
Physician Yoo.

537
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,750
Lady Eun Woo.

538
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,350
I am okay.

539
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,320
Physician Yoo.

540
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,750
Why is your fever not going down?

541
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,730
I am worried sick.

542
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,310
You keep falling ill like this,

543
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,380
what should I do?

544
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,910
Lady Eun Woo.

545
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,100
Physician Yoo.

546
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,190
Are you okay?

547
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,930
I suffered all night.

548
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,270
How embarrassing as a physician.

549
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,440
How is your body feeling?

550
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,830
I will bring some porridge—

551
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,440
Please don't go.

552
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,130
While I was suffering,

553
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,680
I kept seeing you in my dreamlike state.

554
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:50,490
We still did a lot of things together, didn't we?

555
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,860
In my dream, I could see it so vividly like a scene from a novel

556
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,630
which made me so happy.

557
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:09,210
To the point where I almost could not wake up from the dream.

558
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,900
Physician Yoo.

559
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,880
"I am letting Lady Eun Woo go."

560
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,640
"I cannot see her anymore."

561
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,050
Whenever I think about these things

562
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,390
my chest becomes stifled,

563
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,330
and I can't breathe.

564
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,390
And even a fever of the heart...

565
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,160
It is perfectly an illness of the heart.

566
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,300
Yes.

567
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,450
Since a physician of the heart got an illness of the heart,

568
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,430
who shall cure him?

569
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,350
What is this?

570
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,650
Open it if you're so curious.

571
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,410
How dare you?

572
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,150
What is the meaning of this trickery?

573
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,670
It is the same trickery you use, so why feign ignorance?

574
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,890
Hey, you are even more guilty in that area

575
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,840
and what did you say? "Lewd behavior?"

576
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,760
The concubines you robbed from other people,

577
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,870
you thought you had them hidden well, didn't you?

578
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:06,030
If His Majesty sees this,

579
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,740
maybe he'll consider you for cancellation too?

580
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,880
You bastard!

581
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,330
What is it that you want?

582
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,930
Stop acting so generous when you have nothing.

583
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,030
Did someone ask you to make a move?

584
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,680
That means...

585
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,740
You just keep your mouth shut.

586
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,250
I will take care of the rest.

587
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,640
There's a whole list of Royal Clinic Physicians

588
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,000
that follows your name.

589
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,420
Make those guys shut up with you.

590
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,080
If you don't, your position and all of your people

591
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,100
will be doomed.

592
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:59,400
By the way, what's the point if we make that guy shut up?

593
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,940
The investigation will continue anyway.

594
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,740
As long as they don't add fuel to the fire,

595
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,970
His Majesty will bring truth to the light,

596
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:11,970
and we'll punctuate it with the petitions.

597
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,470
Whoa, so that's why you had those petitions.

598
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:18,260
Whoa, you are really the best. You are just like

599
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,060
Zhuge Liang! 
  (T/N: A famous Chinese war strategist during the Three Kingdoms period)

600
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,530
- Come, let me massage you. 
 - No, no, it is okay.

601
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:28,710
If you do this, I will really feel pressured.

602
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,900
He is the one pressuring me.

603
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,040
Physician Yoo,

604
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,500
are you okay?

605
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,570
You should really wait until you get better.

606
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,140
Not at all.

607
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,240
I must go.

608
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,300
I must go with you, Lady Eun Woo.

609
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,300
How come?

610
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,540
I think

611
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,020
I found the path.

612
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,370
Even so, you are in pain.

613
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,880
No.

614
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,590
It is really a strange thing.

615
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,680
When I am with you,

616
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,120
I don't have trouble breathing,

617
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,700
and my chest does not feel stifled.

618
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,140
You shared

619
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,630
that ring with Courtesan Seol Hwa, didn't you?

620
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,950
As a symbol of your feelings.

621
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,420
Seol Hwa was gravely ill.

622
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,710
However, we do not have the medicine.

623
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,580
Where is she ill?

624
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,480
You said she was okay.

625
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,500
Why don't you look for a way?

626
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,130
Instead, you allow yourselves to wither away in illness?

627
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,240
It is not such an easy problem.

628
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,420
It seems you two

629
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,660
are ready to throw everything away and run off together?

630
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,720
Try checking my pulse.

631
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,410
Your sickness has progressed so much.

632
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,800
Is this why you gave up?

633
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,570
You understand now, right?

634
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:00,520
I can no longer go back to Seol Hwa.

635
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,880
Even back then,

636
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,440
I was mean to Seol Hwa because she tried to die after she found out about my illness.

637
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,390
Also for her, instead of becoming the topic of a dirty rumor

638
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,000
it is better for her to forget about me.

639
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,780
Since you do not have time,

640
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,270
you need to make a better decision.

641
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,330
What about you, Physician Yoo?

642
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,630
My time is only a bit shorter.

643
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:32,640
How long do you think your time is, Physician Yoo?

644
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:50,750
If I find a way, will you follow?

645
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,720
No.

646
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,260
I will die soon.

647
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,240
At least for Seol Hwa, this is...

648
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,210
This is the better way.

649
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:10,730
Would Seol Hwa also sincerely want that?

650
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:15,940
Whether you run away, clash, or yell,

651
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,270
is not the time you spend together while alive

652
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,980
the most precious thing?

653
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,240
It will be the end anyway once you pass away.

654
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,440
Can you not be brave for once?

655
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,580
Brave to be with the one

656
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,300
whom you love, as your heart dictates.

657
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,700
During your final moment...

658
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,740
are you confident you'll have no regrets?

659
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:01,250
There is not much time left for those two.

660
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,870
On top of that, during that time

661
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,760
one person will be physically ill,

662
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,310
and the other will be emotionally ill.

663
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,370
Still, they will be happy to the end.

664
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,980
Because they are together.

665
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,010
Yes.

666
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:26,740
 Are you all ready?

667
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,600
 You found the path for me and gave me courage.

668
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,490
 Thank you so much, Physician Seo.

669
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,880
 I sincerely hope you will be happy.

670
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,750
 I will be going now.

671
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,550
 Physician Seo.

672
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:49,800
 You also shouldn't try so hard to hide your feelings.

673
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,090
 Do not be afraid and

674
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,680
 try to do your best for those feelings.

675
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,860
 As to leave no regrets.

676
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,130
Lady Eun Woo, what is wrong?

677
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,240
I do not know.

678
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,200
My heart just aches, too.

679
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,080
Suffering all night,

680
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,320
I finally realized it as well.

681
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,410
That Courtesan Seol Hwa's symptoms

682
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,560
are strangely just like mine.

683
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:01,000
Because I cannot reach this person in front of me,

684
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,430
even though I love her to death.

685
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:10,150
Because the world keeps telling me no.

686
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,040
That it's not possible.

687
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:15,780
Only telling me to let you go.

688
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,650
Once you leave this place,

689
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,100
perhaps, even...

690
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,780
it might be better for you

691
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:34,210
to go study abroad. When such thoughts plagued me

692
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,470
I think I started to suffer from a fever of the heart.

693
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,650
It is not an illness.

694
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,750
I am not sick.

695
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,860
I merely

696
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,970
love you to death.

697
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,590
♫  I think of you more than ever  ♫

698
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:12,780
Hurry up now!

699
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,560
- Let's go play! 
 - Let's go!

700
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,200
It will be so fun!

701
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:21,270
Before it is too late for us,

702
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,660
let's go and write down our wishes.

703
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,780
Yes.

704
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:38,550
♫  Your gaze makes my heart flutter  ♫ 
 ♫  And I finally realize now  ♫

705
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:45,000
♫  It feels like a dream, but I miss you  ♫

706
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:56,060
♫  Where have you gone with your warm gaze for me?  ♫

707
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,980
I hope my wish

708
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,450
will also come true like yours, Lady Eun Woo.

709
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:07,510
What wish did you write?

710
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,880
Is it not obvious?

711
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,800
To always be together.

712
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:22,300
♫  If we can start over again  ♫

713
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:31,370
♫  I will take the first step toward you  ♫

714
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:35,640
"Should I ask her to run away with me? Or perhaps,

715
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,270
should I muster the courage

716
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:41,820
to ask her to jump into the fire and overcome it together?"

717
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,080
I have pondered countless times in my heart.

718
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:54,490
We have not yet found our path.

719
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,090
However,

720
00:57:57,090 --> 00:58:02,890
I won't hide my feelings and let you go.

721
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,920
Even if I am a horrible, selfish person.

722
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,470
If you will forgive me.

723
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,190
My wish to be together with you

724
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,490
will you make it come true, Lady Eun Woo?

725
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:32,070
♫  In my foolishness, I kept my feelings from you  ♫

726
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,590
♫  It lingers on the tip of my tongue as the seasons pass  ♫

727
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,490
I, too,

728
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:43,190
no longer wish to hide my feelings.

729
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:47,650
♫  Fluttering in the wind gently tearing my heart to pieces  ♫

730
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:53,770
♫  If I can send the feelings  ♫

731
00:58:53,770 --> 00:59:03,190
♫  That seep out of my heart  ♫

732
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:36,110

733
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:48,110
♫  Spending my days loving and missing you  ♫

734
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:52,340
♫  The one thing that remains constant  ♫

735
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,700
♫  The one I love is you  ♫

736
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:05,040
♫  The very words "I love you",  I've shouted from my heart hundreds of times  ♫

737
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,650
♫  But I can't say aloud, so I'll wait one more day  ♫

738
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:18,170
♫  Spending my days loving and missing you  ♫

739
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:21,410
♫  The one thing that remains constant  ♫

740
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,390
 Lady Eun Woo, I love you.

741
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:26,420
 My heart is pounding.

742
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,750
 I will block the rain and the wind.

743
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,940
 Jeon Kang Il might look for this in my room.

744
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,550
 I will get rid of that book of faults for you.

745
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,400
 Have you not seen Lady Eun Woo? She has been missing since earlier.

746
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,890
 - Do you really want to die? 
 - Young Lady!

747
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,620
 Where did she go?

748
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:48,480
 How can a so-called governor harm a citizen?

749
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,240
 I just need to silence you forever.

750
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,170
 Lady Eun Woo.
