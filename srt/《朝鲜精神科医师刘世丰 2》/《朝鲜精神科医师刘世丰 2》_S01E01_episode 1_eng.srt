1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,970

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,450

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,810

4
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,120

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,950

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,100

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,310
 Divine Acupuncturist... Yoo Se Yeop.

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,400
 No, Yoo Se Poong!

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,420
 Born in Hanyang,

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,750
 a true Hanyang gentleman who has never once stepped foot outside the city gates...

11
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,950
 or so he was.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,430
 His family fell from grace, and he became broke.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,260
 After going through terrible struggle and all sorts of hardships

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,770
 as a half-wit, who can't even practice acupuncture,

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,110
 he became a physician with skills better than acupuncture,

16
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,850
 also known as...

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,680
 a psychiatrist.

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,090
 There's a legendary story of him opening up the patient's heart like a door.

19
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,940
There's a... better method than acupuncture.

20
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,320
 On top of that, he still got the handsome looks that used to turn Hanyang upside down.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,880
 Wow.

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,320
You're the physician specifically summoned by the king, right?

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,410
My son must take the civil service exam without fail this time.

24
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,240
Will there be a way?

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,990
A way...

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,960
How could...

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,220
there be no way?

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,120

29
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,790
Not accepting the money they were offering,

30
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,600
what's the point of this, exactly?

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,280
I did accept it, though.

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,430
What's that?

33
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,780
I'm sure you elegantly declined earlier, though.

34
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,990
Such nonsense.

35
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,370
With this money, we can get the poor kids some winter clothing.

36
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,510
Well, why are we taking these civil service exam prep books?

37
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,960
They're so freaking heavy.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,670
These heavy exam prep books are

39
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,380
what made the patient sick in the first place.

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,100
I need to remove them as a physician.

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,500
Unwanted and unread books are just burdens.

42
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,530
Of course, he'll be sick when he's surrounded by them.

43
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,740
Aigoo, he still needs to take the civil service exam, though.

44
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,920
His mother wishes for it that desperately.

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,960
If your heart is not in it, you can't see if you look.

46
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,810
You can't hear even if you listen, and you can't taste even if you eat.

47
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,150

48
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,510
What happened to the heart again?

49
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,480
No matter how much his family wants him to pass the exam, what good is it?

50
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,100
If his heart isn't in it, passing and getting a public office isn't his destiny.

51
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,600
If your heart doesn't agree, you'll get sick whatever you do.

52
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,990
I'll also put this down.

53
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,210
My heart doesn't agree.

54
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,820
Man Bok.

55
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,110
Yes.

56
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,790
Do you know how much they're worth?

57
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,850
If we resell them to the bookstore, we'll get paid enough to cover today's house call, at the very least.

58
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,800
Especially so... in this place, Hanyang.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,410
 Come on in!

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,900

61
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,700
Come on in!

62
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,970

63
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,210

64
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,290
Jang Goon, you're doing well.

65
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,420
All right.

66
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,790

67
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,510
Ip Boon! Ip Boon!

68
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,590

69
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,640
Now, please take care.

70
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,660
Whoa! W-What's this?

71
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,850
Gosh.

72
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,900
Aigoo, this is great!

73
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,560

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,240
 Gosh, he's so handsome.

75
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,060
Aigoo, what's this now?

76
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,050
Welcome, everyone. Come on in.

77
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,050
Where does it hurt?

78
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:49,330

79
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,600
J-Jo...

80
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,260
Jo Tae Hak?

81
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,090
Please come with me.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,910
I saw another hallucination again today.

83
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,410
How is my pulse?

84
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,490
You have damhwa...

85
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,750
which is why your chest pounds and you have trouble sleeping.

86
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,040
Your Majesty, you need to put your mind at ease.

87
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,860
Were you gravely worried about the Princess' marriage?

88
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,450
That, too, is a problem, but...

89
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,020
what I really fear is...

90
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,510
that I can't trust anyone in the Royal Court.

91
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,560
Gradually, there will be more people you can trust, Your Majesty.

92
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,100
Will that be so?

93
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,180
One year ago,

94
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,300
if I didn't summon you up to Hanyang...

95
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,290
I would've long been dead.

96
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,810
Lately, his face has been looking worse even more.

97
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,950
I can understand His Majesty's fear.

98
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,070
It's only been a year since that bastard Jo Tae Hak died

99
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,260
after committing treason and clinging to evil to the bitter end.

100
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,470
So of course, he couldn't forget it that easily.

101
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,660
Yes. He probably can't trust anyone.

102
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,200
You were also directly involved in the same incident.

103
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,380
 There's no way!

104
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,680
 Kill him.

105
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,350
Stop acting tough and as if you're only caring about the patients.

106
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,740
Take care of your heart first.

107
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,390
Gosh.

108
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,900
Where are you going this late at night?

109
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,030
Go on home first. I have to stop by somewhere.

110
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,200
Oh, your pulse got better, too.

111
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,310
And your complexion is even better.

112
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,730
I think you can stop the medicine now.

113
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,980
- Thank you. 
 - Yes, yes. Next.

114
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,860
Oh, yes. Young Gook's father. Take a seat.

115
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,320
Thank you for your work.

116
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,650
Gosh! You drank alcohol again, right?

117
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,180
Am I right?

118
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,630
Didn't I tell you alcohol will be the death of you? Right?

119
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,200
Come here. Give me your hand.

120
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,720
You need some needles in you. I'm going to give you

121
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,070
a hundred of the large needles! Large ones!

122
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,540
I told you to head back inside.

123
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,110
Gosh, you're going to wake His Excellency Choi!

124
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,270
W-Whoa, what a surprise.

125
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,490
I thought you went to charge the noble with a big bill.

126
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,790
But treating slaves for free?

127
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
Hanyang's Night Goblin.

128
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,680
Physician Robin Hood.

129
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,060
You like those nicknames, don't you?

130
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,740
Gosh, you're so noisy. Go away.

131
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,070
Aigoo, seriously.

132
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,810
You seem to be seeing a lot of

133
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,760
hallucinations like His Majesty these days.

134
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,850
Do you see one as well, Physician Gye?

135
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,010
Do you think I'm like you?

136
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,770
You... miss Young Lady, don't you?

137
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,310
Yes.

138
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,590
I miss her very much.

139
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,160
Aigoo, His Majesty was really harsh on this.

140
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,430
He could've summoned the Young Lady's family to Hanyang.

141
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,690
It's not like he can go against a royal decree.

142
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,880
He's going to wither to death.

143
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,560
How frustrating, seriously.

144
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,220
Well.

145
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,250

146
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,710
 My father was... decreed to Heuksando.

147
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,230
 When do you have to go?

148
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,830
 Right... this moment.

149
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,330
 This was left to me by my mother.

150
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,080
 She told me to keep it where my heart is.

151
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
 Every moment during the last three months,

152
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,610
 the thought of you, who wasn't even with me,

153
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,620
 interrupted me every step of the way.

154
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,100
 My heart...

155
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,900
 I will leave it here with you.

156
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,710
 Physician Yoo...

157
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,270
 Lady Eun Woo, will you

158
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,970
 promise me that you'll also

159
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,180
 think of me with every step you take?

160
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,680
 Yes.

161
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,890
 I'll think of you with every breath I take.

162
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:07,890
♫  Have you noticed the wind blowing?  ♫

163
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:14,950
♫  Bringing this dying love along  ♫

164
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:21,760
♫  As I look at you with trembling eyes  ♫

165
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,100
♫  I'm happy even when it hurts  ♫

166
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:34,500
♫  Little by little, I can engrave you in my heart  ♫

167
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,180
I really...

168
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,500
I really...

169
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,580
I really miss you so much.

170
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,280
♫  There's one that I can't endure  ♫

171
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,590
♫  Only one thing I can't endure  ♫

172
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,400
♫  I wish and hope every night, when I open my eyes one day  ♫

173
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:12,580
♫  I want to embrace you as you are  ♫

174
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,460
Have you come to yet?

175
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,760
Are you all right?

176
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,570
What is wrong?

177
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,040
Gh... Ghost...

178
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,420
The butterfly...

179
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,430
What are you talking about?

180
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,300
The... dead Left State Minister...

181
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,150
Jo Tae Hak!

182
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,520
How dare you mention the name of a traitor?

183
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,610
To be honest,

184
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,990
since a few days ago, among the palace ladies of the Queen's Court,

185
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,440
there has been a rumor about an apparition appearing.

186
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,660
Jo Tae Hak.

187
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,790
Pardon?

188
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,830
This palace lady just spoke of

189
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,640
the ghost of Jo Tae Hak.

190
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,670
"The ghost was wearing a jade butterfly, his family symbol."

191
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,850
That's what I heard.

192
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,620
It's my fault for lacking virtue.

193
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,140
What are you waiting for? Call for a physician this instant!

194
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,370
Gosh, this is really...

196
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,010
Oh, Namhaedaek!

197
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,000
Where are the rest of the consultation papers?

198
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,200
It hasn't been long since the paper merchant came by.

199
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,560
Look carefully.

200
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,720
You're forgetful these days, too.

201
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,960
Hey, Gye Ip Boon. What are you doing with these precious papers?

202
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,690
Father, don't you want to buy a tile-roofed house in Hanyang?

203
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,600
What's with this nonsense, so early in the morning?

204
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,750
There are so many great fabric shops in Hanyang.

205
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,740
They earn a lot more money than physicians, too.

206
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,960
First, I'll go into the palace as a royal tailor's assistant,

207
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,130
set up the best fabric shop,

208
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,340
and make you proud and rich, Father!

209
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
Gye Ip Boon,

210
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,530
they said the sparrow near a school sings the primer.

211
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,570
After all these years living under your physician father, you don't know a single acupuncture point.

212
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,530
It'll take a thousand years once you pick up a needle to buy me a tile-roofed house!

213
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,370
Ip Boon Noona is not a sparrow!

214
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,560
Ip Boon Noona is not stupid!

215
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,820
Hey! That's more insulting.

216
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,710
She's being like that

217
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,480
because she doesn't know what a dangerous place Hanyang is.

218
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,190
That's right.

219
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,610
Wild Boar is like this because he's been stabbed.

220
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,960
Aigoo, Granny.

221
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,810
You think you know me?

222
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,440
I know everything.

223
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,850
You little dreamy-headed brat.

224
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,270
Go ahead and waste one more paper.

225
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm going to throw away every brush, including that one, got it?

226
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,290
Wait, where did Half-wit go when it's almost mealtime?

227
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,710
Let him be.

228
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,260
Physician Yoo feels full even without eating right now.

229
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,520
Did he achieve enlightenment?

230
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,810
How can he feel full without eating?

231
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,740
 Physician Yoo, are you doing well without any problems?

232
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,370
 Thank you for the letter you sent.

233
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,270
 I'm living a good, busy life.

234
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,300
 Because I found something I can do here.

235
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,530
 There are plenty of herbs that are hard to find on land.

236
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,070
 So, I'm having great fun finding medicinal herbs.

237
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,720
 - Whoa! 
 - Aigoo!

238
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,030
 Whoa.

239
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,110
 Yikes!

240
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,550
 Gosh.

241
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,600
 Yuck!

242
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm sure you know better than that, so why?

243
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,530
 I ate the leaf of toothed ixeridium accidentally,

244
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,480
 so I thought my tongue was going to run away.

245
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,190
Young Master. Are you not going to eat?

246
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,910
Young Master!

247
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,830
I-I'll be there, you wretch!

248
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,170
There.

249
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,020
But wait. There are only a few days left until the 15th of the month.

250
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,590
Do some grocery shopping in advance for her favorites.

251
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,910
Also, buy some chunks of meat.

252
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,950
Gosh, how great. Thanks to her,

253
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,340
we'll be filling our stomachs until they burst.

254
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,470
Is someone coming here, then?

255
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,980
 On the 15th of this month, I plan to go to Hanyang.

256
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,660
It's the Young Lady.

257
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,680
Didn't you receive a letter, too?

258
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,120
Oh, he did, but...

259
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,930
he thought he was the only one, so he hid somewhere to read it.

260
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,970
Then why don't you know?

261
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,860
She's coming to Hanyang on the 15th.

262
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,000
Aigoo, I guess she just left out that Half-wit.

263
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,060
How do you put it?

264
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,270
Doesn't care at all.

265
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,320
My Lady doesn't care at all about you.

266
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,340
This is what you wanted to say.

267
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,080
Oh, yes, yes.

268
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,040
I simply haven't finished reading my letter.

269
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,340
I was also aware.

270
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,420
Do you think she would've just left me out?

271
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,450
No.

272
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,600
I think she just left you out.

273
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,820
Is Poong's new bride coming?

274
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,400
It's your first wedding night.

275
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,360
Aigoo.

276
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,450
Aigoo, Granny. It's not like that.

277
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,560
It's not their first wedding night?

278
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,720
Then how many nights will it be?

279
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,180
- Aigoo.
 - All right, all right.

280
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,520
Jang Goon, eat up.

281
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,100
Why is it only you?

282
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,820
They're all avoiding this place out of fear of the plague.

283
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,910
They should be ashamed!

284
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,120
How about you?

285
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,770
How could a physician who treats diseases be afraid of a disease?

286
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,870
How do you feel?

287
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,100
Physician... Will I die, too?

288
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,410
They said whoever sees the ghost will get sick.

289
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,710
Nonsense!

290
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,380
My patients do not die.

291
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,470
The number of palace ladies vomiting and showing symptoms is increasing overnight.

292
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,350
Do they all show the same symptoms?

293
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,270
What kind of disease is this?

294
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,900
Seeing that it's only limited to the Queen's Pavilion,

295
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,110
I surmise it's cholera morbus.

296
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,150
It could also be an omen of plague.

297
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,420
 What?

298
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,530
 - A plague?
 - How could that be?

299
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,130
 How is that possible?

300
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,950
Again... Again!

301
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,830
Will you once again blame it on me for lacking virtue?

302
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,610
Call for Yoo Se Yeop.

303
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,160
Immediately!

304
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,070
Calling for Physician Yoo at this time

305
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,560
goes against the palace customs, Your Majesty!

306
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,250
What exactly is important?

307
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,680
Is it the palace customs or the lives?

308
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,660

309
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,460
That damned Yoo Se Yeop. Yoo Se Yeop!

310
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,020
If he's going to involve that wretch in the palace ladies' affairs,

311
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,790
what on earth does he want the royal physicians to do?

312
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,660
Did you just say, Yoo Se Yeop?

313
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,300
This is cholera morbus?

314
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,170
That's what the Royal Clinic diagnosed it as.

315
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,500
I don't think it's food poisoning.

316
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,930
Yes.

317
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,790
It's something else, for sure.

318
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,540
We thoroughly investigated what the palace ladies ate,

319
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,000
but there was nothing remarkable.

320
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,410
Have the ill increased in numbers?

321
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,360
They didn't eat anything out of the ordinary?

322
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,470
Yes.

323
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,860
Just today,

324
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,270
ten palace ladies had already collapsed.

325
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,990
We'll figure out what's going around,

326
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,070
so please hang in there a bit longer.

327
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,010
It's not food poisoning or a plague.

328
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,480
So we're looking for a different cause.

329
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,290
Apparition...

330
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,200
They said it was an apparition.

331
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,820
Se Yeop,

332
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,660
they say Jo Tae Hak's ghost is wandering around the palace.

333
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,620
Is that not just ridiculous?

334
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,320
If you can treat the palace ladies' illnesses,

335
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,530
I'll reward you greatly.

336
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,850
Is there anything you want?

337
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,120
Famine and disaster have increased the number of sick.

338
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,540
If we want to stop your people from dying,

339
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,040
we'll need high-quality medicinal ingredients.

340
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,080
And if Your Majesty could look after Gye Soo Clinic

341
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,140
both physically and emotionally,

342
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,990
it will be a huge help in treating the people.

343
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,570
All right.

344
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,030
You must first work to save the palace ladies.

345
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,050
I am overwhelmed with your unfathomable grace, Your Majesty.

346
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,060
I will now prepare gamiondamtang, which can treat His Majesty's symptoms.

347
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,570
 You must not, Your Majesty!

348
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,540
Who dares to cause a ruckus?

349
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,810
The Royal Clinic physicians have come out to inspect the pharmacy.

350
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,670
What must I not do?

351
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,850
The ondamtang used for simdamheogub is not suitable for this.

352
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,160
Your Majesty must take the cheongsimtang the Royal Clinic has prescribed you.

353
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,670
Your Majesty's body is too weak to use cheongsimtang—

354
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,300
How can someone who is neither a physician nor a chief royal physician care for your health?

355
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:31,020
 Please deliberate on this matter, Your Majesty!

356
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,010
Not a single thing has changed here.

357
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,430
Is anyone of you shouting like this

358
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,770
after having personally felt His Majesty's pulse?

359
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,910
His Majesty's chi is dispersed due to gyeonggyejeung.

360
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,780
Do you not all know that crowding in here and causing a ruckus

361
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,510
is exacerbating his symptoms?

362
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,570
Are you ruining his mood when you're well aware of that?

363
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,380
That's enough.

364
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,100
I will follow the prescription of the Royal Clinic,

365
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,880
so all of you may leave.

366
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,040
 We are overwhelmed with your unfathomable grace, Your Majesty.

367
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,070
The mysterious disease of the palace ladies

368
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,940
is also making progress due to the Royal Clinic's treatments.

369
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,630
Please give full authority to the Royal Clinic, Your Majesty.

370
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,010
My goodness.

371
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,470
New cases of palace ladies with the disease are coming up one after another.

372
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,240
I think you have it wrong.

373
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,930
Or you are conning His Majesty.

374
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,210
The reason I called for them

375
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,430
is to help the Royal Physicians.

376
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,650
Please work together to learn the cause of this case.

377
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,680
I put my trust in you, Chief Royal Physician.

378
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,030
Your Majesty!

379
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,320
You may all leave now.

380
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,720
Why is he staring at me like that?

381
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,690
Physician Gye,

382
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,340
you should've just stayed put in the sticks where you were chased off to.

383
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,810
How dare you step foot back in here?

384
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,900
I didn't come to see you.

385
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,220
Wow.

386
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,270
Royal Physicians still lack the skills

387
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,260
and only possess big egos.

388
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,090
The palace ladies' sickness is not cholera morbus.

389
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,820
How dare a bastard who was kicked out for incompetence speak of Royal Physicians' skills?

390
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,270
I wasn't kicked out due to incompetence.

391
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,150
I got sick of everything and left on my own feet.

392
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,700
Isn't this a skill you Royal Physicians have?

393
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,590
Putting different values even on human life?

394
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,010
It would be in your best interest

395
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,420
to keep that flippant mouth in check.

396
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,740
Right.

397
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,170
Did you get a chance to meet that palace lady?

398
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:02,880
I am curious to know if she's even aware you were kicked out like that.

399
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,460
That flipping bastard.

400
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,440
Physician Gye, there are ears all around us.

401
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,400
This is why I don't like Royal Physicians.

402
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,620
They only think about their reputations.

403
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,270
Geez, makes me feel filthy.

404
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,060
Gosh!

405
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,140
I'm going to make a trip while you meet Uncle.

406
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,570
To where?

407
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,500
Everyone will be disappointed.

408
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,630
I told you I'm going to Gye Soo Clinic—

409
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,580
Aigoo, be careful!

410
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,990
I-I'm sorry.

411
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,140

412
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,090

413
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,240

414
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,800

415
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,330
Drunk this early in the day.

416
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,290
- Whoa!
 - Oh, my gosh! Look here!

417
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,360
Look here!

418
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,400
- Look here!
 - Step aside, please!

419
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,240

420
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,660
One,

421
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,280
two,

422
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,580
three.

423
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,260
Are you all right?

424
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,340
Aigoo, what a relief.

425
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,800
Aigoo!

426
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,610
He must be taken to a physician.

427
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,140
All right.

428
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,870
You did a wonderful deed.

429
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,960
Take care.

430
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,150
Father.

431
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,020
What will you do if something goes wrong?

432
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,280
It could've been more dangerous if we didn't act immediately.

433
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,380
You must be mindful of others' eyes.

434
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,750
Be more cautious.

435
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,460
All right. I understand your concern, Father.

436
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,660
Aigoo! Geez...

437
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,150
What are you doing?

438
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:19,030
This has a terrible stench.

439
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,040
I'm sure she ate something.

440
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,770
Physician, here! Over here!

441
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,970
- Here!
 - This way.

442
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,440
Hold this in your mouth for a moment. Here.

443
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,130
There.

444
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,820
No, no. Don't eat it.

445
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,440
You can't eat it.

446
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,950
See, look at this! Look at this!

447
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,760
As expected, it's not what we thought.

448
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,980
It's definitely not cholera morbus.

449
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,400
By chance... is it poison.

450
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,290
That's right! They ate poison.

451
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,240
We must change the medicinal herbs first.

452
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,380
Who dares to...

453
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,220
mention "poison" recklessly?

454
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,940
This is a palace!

455
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,030
Did you forget about the Jo Tae Hak incident?

456
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,140
How could you insist that it is not poison?

457
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,960
Shut your mouth.

458
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,770
Do you think I do not know you're merely exaggerating to take credit for the contribution?

459
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,840
So, you're saying

460
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,790
you will not give us medicinal ingredients?

461
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,430
Do you want everyone to die?

462
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,110
Do not be unreasonable and go back,

463
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,870
before I tell His Majesty about this.

464
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,520
Geez, you idiots!

465
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,570
Go and look up your medical books!

466
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,190
How is that cholera morbus?

467
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,470
Have those palace ladies vomit right away

468
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,140
and we must use antidote pills or black bryony!

469
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,500
How dare you order my subordinates around!

470
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,800
Are you some street thug?

471
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,070
People are sick, and you're worried about who's under whom?

472
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,340
We are running out of time.

473
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,590
Give us mung beans and licorice, at least.

474
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,950
Hey, no need.

475
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,330
Break through them. Let's go and get them ourselves.

476
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,310
We have no medicinal ingredients for crazy quacks like you!

477
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,400
What are you doing?

478
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,880
Form a barricade!

479
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,950
Geez, come on.

480
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,180
These guys became even more childish.

481
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,580
Aigoo.

482
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,220
Does it make sense that they won't give us medicinal ingredients? How dare they.

483
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,140
Geez.

484
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,110
An apparition...

485
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,600
Physician! Physician!

486
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,960
Put her down here.

487
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,740
I saw him...

488
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,400
I saw the... apparition...

489
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,670
Glaucoma of the eyes.

490
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,670
What are you doing?

491
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,220
Acupuncture needles!

492
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,030
Move.

493
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,230
She has glaucoma.

494
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,670
What?

495
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,310
Just a moment.

496
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,070
Glaucoma.

497
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,050
That's right. It was a misdiagnosis.

498
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,760
So, will you still insist that it's cholera morbus?

499
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,040
No.

500
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,400
The Royal Clinic was not wrong.

501
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,570
Geez, that...

502
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,860
How do I look? Totally pretty, right?

503
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,990
- A virgin ghost.
 - Geez!

504
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,170
You're not, by chance, going out like that, are you?

505
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,350
Ip Boon Noona made it herself.

506
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,800
It's pretty!

507
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,060
As expected of Jang Goon.

508
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,700
You're practically a Hanyang man now.

509
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,680
You have a high standard. Very chic.

510
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,610
Chic, my foot.

511
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,330
If you walk around at night like that,

512
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,080
I think you'll get into huge trouble.

513
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,700
- This dress is the latest trend, you know! 
 - Geez!

514
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,720
Come, come here.

515
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,710
- Come on, get over here! 
 - Hurry.

516
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,520
Aigoo.

517
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm supposed to meet Unnies who run the best fabric shop around here.

518
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,650
I mean, those Unnies said

519
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,790
they'll make clothes based on my drawings and pay me for the sale.

520
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,240
Aigoo, did you even write a contract before working?

521
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,260
Why do you keep pouring cold water on my idea here?

522
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,370
You just trust their word at first, you know.

523
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,870
Hey, if they sell many outfits,

524
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,170
aren't you losing out on the deal?

525
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,920
No.

526
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,240
I think they'll become trendy after about 500 years.

527
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,040
Gosh, these people don't know this line of business at all!

528
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,930
Once I sell one or two drawings,

529
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,740
I'll have my answer.

530
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,790
- They said my drawings are worth some money. 
 - Money?

531
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,140
You've sold it to them and found out your drawings are worth some money?

532
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,800
- Yes.
 - Whoa.

533
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,740
Hey, Hanyang people have some strange tastes.

534
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,400
You know, I'm a pretty good artist.

535
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,360
Aigoo, who'd run such a business like that?

536
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,960
Who is it?

537
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,390
Geez, seriously.

538
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,310
Ip Boon!

539
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,620
I'm off now!

540
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,910
Unnies! Coming!

541
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,630
Hey, hey! Gye Ip Boon!

542
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,470
Hey?

543
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,430
Aigoo, is she a ghost or a person?

544
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,900
 What?

545
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,970
What happened to you?

546
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,230
Well, someone tried to go head-to-head with me, so I taught him a lesson.

547
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,840
Jang Goon, let's go pack up some leftover medicinal ingredients.

548
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,360
- Okay!
 - Why?

549
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,410
Is someone coming to steal our medicinal ingredients?

550
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,530
Well, the Royal Clinic won't give us any medicinal ingredients.

551
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,550
Even still, are we going to pack up our ingredients and go to the palace?

552
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,570
We have to do that in order to save sick palace ladies.

553
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,120
I'm so excited! We're going to the palace! The palace!

554
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:52,430
I'm actually the queen, you know.

555
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,050
There she goes again.

556
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,900
- Right, right. 
 - Okay, got it.

557
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,010
We're going to the palace!

558
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,740
 Gosh, no way!

559
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,470
I don't want to! I hate it!

560
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,860
A ghost?

561
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,470
They say there's a ghost, yet you still want me to stay here?

562
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,430
It has affected only the palace ladies in the Queen's Pavilion.

563
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,510
You will be fine, Your Highness.

564
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,790
The Queen's Pavilion is very close to here!

565
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,540
Look at the dark circles under my eyes.

566
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,370
I can't sleep because I'm so scared!

567
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,390
At this rate, I might become the virgin ghost!

568
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,810
You called off...

569
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,170
your wedding like that.

570
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,330
It would be strange if you did sleep well.

571
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,340
You should keep your mouth shut, Court Lady Jung.

572
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,580
I will ask His Majesty to change my residence.

573
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,390
All right. Let us go!

574
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,080
He ordered...

575
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,870
not to let anyone into the bedchamber.

576
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,320
Do you think he would refuse to see me, though?

577
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,680
I will personally see him and ask him.

578
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,350
I don't think he'll meet with you.

579
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,950
How could you face His Majesty after causing such trouble?

580
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,680
Straighten your back.

581
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,100
They are lowering our standards.

582
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,570
Hey!

583
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,360
You will just waste your trip over if he does not see you.

584
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,100
His Majesty is in a bad mood to start with.

585
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,900
At least, you should try to put him at ease, Your Highness.

586
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,600
That is why I should comfort His Majesty.

587
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,010
You should give His Majesty some time alone.

588
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,180
I am... a noble princess.

589
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,670
And how dare you?

590
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,800
I deserve to die, Your Highness!

591
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,170
Your Highness, please contain yourself.

592
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,070
You stopped walking so abruptly.

593
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,600
Court Lady Jung, are you saying it was my fault?

594
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,880
That is not it...

595
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,690
I was on my way to see His Majesty, yet my pretty shoes got dirtied!

596
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,840
I cannot wear these! Throw them away, now!

597
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,040
Flower shoes!

598
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,900
I used to wear it when I was a princess.

599
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,530
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

600
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,100
Let go!

601
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,340
Gosh, how dare they...

602
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,060
Aigoo.

603
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,970
 He's my friend, Se Yeop.

604
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,580
How come he's here?

605
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,340
I know.

606
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,550
How come he is here?

607
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,200
Aigoo.

608
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,010
What are you doing just standing there?

609
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,030
Come and bring it here.

610
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,770
Hurry... hurry, go...

611
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,430
Let's go... go...

612
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,850
How can you throw it?

613
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,380
No, no.

614
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,600
- Just go.
 - My shoe...

615
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,970
Go, go, go.

616
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,790
Aigoo, seriously.

617
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:36,430
Court Lady Jung!

618
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,340
Gosh, these people...

619
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,390
What happened?

620
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,100
We have more patients.

621
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,790
What is the Royal Clinic doing?

622
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,650
No one from the Royal Clinic came.

623
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,260
What?

624
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,660
Court Lady!

625
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,840
Yes?

626
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,760
I heard Chief Royal Physician took Deok Hee away.

627
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,270
What?

628
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:06,110
That palace lady fed something to everyone.

629
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,660
Pardon?

630
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,160
What do you mean?

631
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,930
- My Lord, you should not go to that extent─ 
- And if not?

632
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,780
Are you saying we should admit that the Royal Clinic was wrong?

633
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:25,200
Tell the truth and let us know what you fed to the other palace ladies!

634
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,210
I really didn't do anything.

635
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,650
What in the world are you doing right now?

636
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,990
Is threatening a patient how the Royal Clinic runs things?

637
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:40,790
Then is it your way to ignore the palace customs and rules with the backing of His Majesty?

638
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,350
Whether I am a physician off the streets or from the Royal Clinic,

639
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,020
the goal is the same. To cure the patient.

640
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,930
How insolent!

641
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,870
This palace lady is my patient. So, I will take her with me.

642
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,520
Leave him be.

643
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,770
He acts just like Gye Ji Han.

644
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,730
He will soon get kicked out of the palace.

645
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,910
I heard you saw an apparition.

646
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:22,300
I heard it had the appearance of the dead Jo Tae Hak.

647
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,410
Yes.

648
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:27,170
The spirit of the dead Left State Minister is wandering the palace.

649
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,300
People are saying you are cursed when you see the apparition.

650
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,670
Why did you go to the Queen's Pavilion, which has been shut down for a long time?

651
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,640
That's... because I was just passing by.

652
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,990
Why would you pass by there at that late hour?

653
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,720
I thought Physician Gye's home was right around here.

654
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,710

655
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,210
Physician Yoo?

656
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,290
Physician Gye.

657
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,000
Did everyone go somewhere?

658
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:15,560

659
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:20,860

660
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,980
How could you be so rude and arrogant?

661
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:51,530
No. You are the one who is rude and arrogant for not admitting your misdiagnosis.

662
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,270
I will extract all the poison by making the proper antidote.

663
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,820
 What is with these people?

664
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,640
Something seems really off, right?

665
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,320
Some strange people came in and gave the diagnosis

666
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,750
and made medicine without any problems.

667
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,340
But they do such a great job at that.

668
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,810
- Physician.
 - Yes.

669
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:46,320
Do you know what I have always called the Royal Clinic?

670
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,640
A well.

671
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,200
You're just a frog who doesn't know anything outside of his well.

672
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,680
Frogger.

673
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,030
What is your name?

674
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,710
I'm Jeon Kang Il.

675
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,910
Jeon Kang Il.

676
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,830
Jeon Kang Il.

677
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,580
Well, he seems skilled,

678
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,920
but I'm sure he only learned bad habits.

679
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,330
Let's take your medicine!

680
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,420
 They... don't know me.

681
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,090
 They... don't remember me at all.

682
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,370
Gosh, good work, everyone.

683
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,110
Go in and rest now.

684
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,030
Go and rest.

685
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,110
Goodbye, Unnis! Thanks for today!

686
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,750
- Bye, Ip Boon!
 - Bye!

687
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,130
- Hey, Gye Ip Boon.
 - Yes?

688
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,160
Do you know how busy we were today?

689
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,400
What have you been up to that you're home just now?

690
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,130
Gosh, you all bring it upon yourselves.

691
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:08,750
Just wait a little longer. I will have you all wrapped up in silk soon.

692
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,750
How come this girl becomes

693
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,970
full of hot air as time goes by?

694
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,670
That, that, that...

695
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,480
You should give her a big scolding.

696
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,030
She hangs out with Hanyang's low-class partiers these days.

697
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,810
How would you know if they're low-class?

698
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,600
Those Unnis are doing so well for themselves!

699
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,760
Gosh, right!

700
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,270
Wild Boar, she's no joke.

701
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,330
I'm sure every other person you ask knows about her.

702
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,370
I heard they work at the fabric shop.

703
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,490
Their faces look pretty rough around the edges

704
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:38,430
but they sure dress nicely.

705
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:40,990
Father, look!

706
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,610
It's the profit from the clothes I drafted.

707
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,150
They just want me to draw the pictures for them.

708
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,750
They say I'll be sitting on a pile of money!

709
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,090
It really is money.

710
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,440
Hey.

711
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,530
Of course, it's real money.

712
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,640
Ip Boon Noona, will you be famous with prestige now?

713
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,390
She'll probably ruin herself and her family!

714
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,840
Father, look at your rough hands that treat all those patients.

715
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,490
My heart breaks.

716
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,250
Then, don't slack off

717
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,370
- and learn medicine— 
 - Gosh!

718
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,080
Forget running the clinic!

719
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,000
I will draft clothes

720
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,100
and let you live in luxury!

721
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,240
Aigoo, aigoo.

722
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,150
She's lost her mind. She's crazy.

723
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,000
Why is she scaring me like that?

724
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,950
That'd be embarrassing.

725
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,490
I'll have to make ondamtang.
  (Herbal medicine for anxiety)

726
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,290
My hallucinations are becoming too vivid.

727
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,290
Have you been well, Physician?

728
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,350
Lady Eun Woo.

729
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,540
Lady Eun Woo!

730
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,480
It's not yet the 15th of the month. How come—

731
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,690
Is this not a dream?

732
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,220
No.

733
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:47,750
♫  Like a wandering bird who has lost their way  ♫

734
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,110
W-Why are you doing this, Physician?

735
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,580
I've only seen you as a phantom for such a long time.

736
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,570
I just want to make sure.

737
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,350
♫  Lean on me for a moment, set down your sorrows and fly  ♫

738
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,530
You really are standing right in front of me.

739
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:05,400
Yes. I missed you very much, too!

740
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:15,730
♫  But I'm exhausted and just want to collapse  ♫ 
 ♫  Small and lonely people are all the same  ♫

741
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:20,840
♫  Please tell me now, all the loneliness in your heart  ♫

742
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:27,990
♫  Please tell me now, all the loneliness in your heart  ♫

743
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,980
♫  Please tell me now, all your painful sighs  ♫

744
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:40,360
♫  Please tell me now, all your painful sighs  ♫

745
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,900
Young Master, you know, the meat. It's getting cold. Come and—

746
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,580
Aigoo.

747
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,400
Lady Eun Woo?

748
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,550
- Lady Eun Woo. 
 - How have you been?

749
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:07,100
Oh, my goodness.

750
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,050
Yes, it is indeed you, My Lady!

751
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,620
Aigoo, wait a minute.

752
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,070
Lady Eun Woo is here!

753
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,640
Aigoo.

754
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,740
Lady, please eat up.

755
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,910
It must've been tough traveling the long distance.

756
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,930
Good thing I bought all the groceries in advance.

757
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,590
I almost served up dried radish greens porridge for you.

758
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:43,480
I really missed your cooking, Namhaedaek.

759
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,800
Okay.

760
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,980
All right.

761
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,710
There.

762
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,860
Please hurry and eat a lot.

763
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:01,480
Oh, my. I can't stand the sight of you.

764
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,630
As for a drumstick for me,

765
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,520
I'll get it myself.

766
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,460
- Okay. 
- Aigoo!

767
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,930
You sure take good care of yourself.

768
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,490
I do not worry about you at all.

769
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:19,310
But My Lady, living on an island must suit you.

770
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,100
You got even prettier.

771
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,540
Then I guess Hanyang doesn't suit the guy next to you?

772
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:29,330
The way he's giggling makes him look worse than a half-wit.

773
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,800
Try eating this, too!

774
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,130
It's sweet with taffy on it.

775
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,650
Thanks, Jang Goon.

776
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,740
Gosh! But is it okay for me to eat such a precious thing?

777
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,140
I can give you one every day.

778
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,370
But Granny, what's wrong?

779
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:46,890
Aren't you glad to see Lady Eun Woo?

780
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:51,160
Oh, my?

781
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,240
Granny. It's been a while.

782
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,040
Have you been well?

783
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,480
Granny.

784
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,750
She jumped for happiness when we said we were coming to Hanyang.

785
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,060
But now that we're here, I guess she's not too happy about it.

786
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,790
She's restless these days.

787
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,270
Promise me.

788
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,630
You won't ever leave our Poong again, right?

789
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:26,100
You'll continue to stay by Poong's side, right?

790
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,180
Gosh, Granny, what are you saying?

791
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,920
Who left him?

792
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,210
In Granny's eyes,

793
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,160
Lady Eun Woo is destined to be Physician Yoo's bride.

794
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,420
There! Now, you made a promise!

795
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,340
Let's hurry up and eat!

796
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,100
Lady Eun Woo, please eat.

797
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,550
Eat a lot.

798
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,300
Thank you for the meal!

799
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,000
Hey!

800
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,810
How come you only ate two bowls of rice?

801
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,690
Did you lose your appetite?

802
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,910
Where are you going at this time of the night?

803
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:22,750
Well, everyone has their personal lives.

804
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,190
I have something to look into.

805
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,000
I'll be back!

806
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,380
Wait.

807
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,300
I can picture it in front of me.

808
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:09,290
What do you mean?

809
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,460
You must have swum here.

810
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,440
That's how you probably played here.

811
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,930
Physician Yoo, by chance,

812
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:19,270
did you only read books when you were little?

813
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,520
No.

814
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,260
Once I left the house,

815
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,980
I wouldn't come home.

816
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,530
So my mother was always worried about me.

817
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,230
Really?

818
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,230
I cannot imagine it.

819
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,000
How beautiful.

820
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,570
Yes.

821
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,640
This is a beautiful place.

822
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,300
No.

823
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,970
You are, Lady Eun Woo.

824
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:32,990
I have always kept it with me.

825
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,450
Just as you...

826
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:51,780
always kept my heart near yours, Lady Eun Woo.

827
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:22,380
Because of the King's order,

828
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,760
I had to wait a year to do this.

829
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,500
Is the situation still so bad

830
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,160
that you always need to be near his majesty?

831
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,700
Yes.

832
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,980
They say... that the ghost of Jo Tae Hak is haunting the palace.

833
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,310
What does that mean?

834
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,250
The palace ladies who have seen the apparition

835
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:53,590
all collapse, vomiting, and had seizures.

836
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,970
I believe they have been poisoned.

837
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:02,220
Are you saying the ones who have seen the apparition were poisoned?

838
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,740
What did the apparition look like?

839
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:08,820
 He was wearing a white shroud.

840
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,550
 I could not look long because I was so scared.

841
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,280
 Even when I close my eyes,

842
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,370
 I can see him.

843
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:18,300
Even if she closed her eyes, she could see him?

844
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,520
The other day, another palace lady collapsed, saying she saw an apparition.

845
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,660
But she had glaucoma of the eyes.

846
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,360
That ghost...

847
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,580
I'll have to see it for myself.

848
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:34,400
Right now?

849
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,450
I must see the apparition with my own eyes

850
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,720
to find out the reason for the spread of illness.

851
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,340
That way, His Majesty will become healthier and stronger.

852
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,000
And that way, you will also—

853
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,590
Get to stay by your side, Lady Eun Woo.

854
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:58,070
Let us go. To catch the ghost.

855
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,490
A curse?

856
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:24,380
Jo Tae Hak's curse?

857
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:02,320
This is where the palace ladies have seen the apparition.

858
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,270
I see.

859
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,960
If we investigate this area,

860
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,200
we might be able to see the apparition ourselves.

861
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:14,000
But this is the scent of lilies, isn't it?

862
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:18,250
Do they plant lilies around the well inside the palace?

863
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,750
You're right. I can smell the faint scent of it.

864
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,260
I did not detect it during the day because things were so hectic.

865
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,840
But... where did they plant them?

866
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:47,690
 Your Highness!

867
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,820
Your Highness! What happened?

868
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,080
Are you all right?

869
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,100
A ghost!

870
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,550
What took you so long?

871
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:02,430
You should have protected me!

872
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,510
He went that way.

873
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,480
The ghost...

874
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,840
Your Highness.

875
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:30,950
Your Highness.

876
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,060
Are you all right?

877
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:16,800
How rude.

878
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,970
What in the world are you doing?

879
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,190
You are the rude one here.

880
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,070
What?

881
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:36,770

882
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:40,530
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫

883
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:43,910
♫  This shouldn't be difficult  ♫

884
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:47,370
♫  There's one that I can't endure  ♫

885
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:48,990
♫  Only one thing I can't endure  ♫

886
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,860
 You must be very close to the Princess.

887
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,690
 You came here with Yoo Se Yeop, right?

888
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,520
 Did something happen to him?

889
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,480
 Do you think the poison is being spread outside the palace?

890
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,700
 His Majesty's condition has worsened.

891
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:06,450
 Anyone scheming treachery will be facing the death sentence!

892
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:11,230
 That improper widow.

893
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:13,330
 Are you returning to Heuksando?

894
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:14,660
 Please don't go.

895
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,720
 How could we stay apart again?

896
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,460
♫  What should I do?  ♫

897
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,180
♫  Don't leave my side  ♫
