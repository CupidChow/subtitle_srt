1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:08,010

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,390

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,910

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,000

5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,070

6
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,080

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,970

8
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,020
Can we not walk side by side?

9
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,730
What do we do from now?

10
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,730
Just as we have been doing.

11
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,900
- Doing well. 
 - Yes.

12
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,830
Okay, then.

13
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,810
I will go ahead first.

14
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,070
That is even weirder.

15
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,260
Lady Eun Woo.

16
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,070
Yes?

17
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,780
I love you.

18
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,810
Very much so.

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,020
Yes. Me, too.

20
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,580
 Shall we go inside?

21
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,970
Dan?

22
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,680
They are here.

23
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,610
Okay. You are here?

24
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,370
When you are at Heuksando,

25
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,170
- you need to have some sashimi. 
 - I see.

26
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,330
I guess you two had a good time at the fireworks.

27
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,480
Why prepare sashimi this late at night?

28
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,290
Mother, have you been w-waiting for us all this time?

29
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,810
Why are you stuttering, Young Man?

30
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,480
Here, have a glass. It is a specialty liquor of Heuksando.

31
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,630
I am really sorry, but do you have anything like a smoked-plum drink?

32
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,520
Oh, my!

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,570
I heard you cannot drink,

34
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,850
but I guess it was really true.

35
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,820
A man who cannot drink even a sip of alcohol.

36
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,390
Physician Yoo, you are really

37
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,820
too perfect!

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,100
Aigoo, he is the rarest of the rare finds.

39
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,690
How is it that even your eyelashes are long and handsome?

40
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,770
My eyelashes are not particularly that handsome—

41
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,540
You are handsome everywhere.

42
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,020
You will find much handsomeness upon closer look.

43
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,800
I will make sure to look closely at you.

44
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,530
Young Lady, you are happy, right?

45
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,930
- Help yourself. 
 - Please let me pour you a glass.

46
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,690
 It is too delicious!

47
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,670
 Right? Would you like to live here, then?

48
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,810
 Should I do that, Mother?

49
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,120
 Gosh, we need to go back tomorrow.

50
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,200

51
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,710
- Who are you looking for? 
 - My goodness!

52
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,390
Hey, this is Mak Jin, isn't it?

53
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,950
Are you feeling ill somewhere?

54
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,340
That isn't it. I just have trouble sleeping, so...

55
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,220
Since Physician Yoo is good with the illness of the heart, maybe he could help me.

56
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,740
Aigoo, that's a problem.

57
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,010
Physician Yoo is far away from here right now.

58
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,450
What? When is he coming back?

59
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,870
Well, we don't know that.

60
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,050
What's keeping you up at night?

61
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,210
You need to pass out after a day's work.

62
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,060
I'm a little timid, so...

63
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,260
 I finally got a job at the market a while ago,

64
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,140
 but I had to quit because the hours did not fit with the prohibitory decree.

65
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,040
Since we've written the petition,

66
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,900
I get anxious and afraid just at the sight of an official passing by.

67
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,810
So I haven't slept a wink since that day.

68
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,620
Aigoo, is it that bad?

69
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,560
That makes us feel so bad.

70
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,650
You got sick while trying to help us out?

71
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,390
Hey, let's take out Mak Jin's letter from the list!

72
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,880
Yes, yes.

73
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,060
We've a mountain of petitions now,

74
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,530
so there won't be an issue if we take out just one.

75
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,950
N-No, you don't need to do that.

76
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,190
Jang Goon will go and bring it.

77
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,340
Yes, hurry up and go.

78
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,080
No! I said it's okay!

79
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,720
I'll just wait inside.

80
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,030
 I am happy  and excited

81
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,250
 that you are... coming with me.

82
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,320
 My heart... is pounding.

83
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,680
 For what reason?

84
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,050
 Because from now on...

85
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,780
 I don't know what will happen.

86
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,070
 Whatever may come,

87
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,750
 I am okay since we are together.

88
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,000
 I wish this path were just a bit longer.

89
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,690
So, to play chicken fight,

90
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,400
straighten your leg and fold it.

91
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Then hold it and jump.

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,020
Jump, jump, jump, jump—

93
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,490
Oh, my. Young Master!

94
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,410
Have you all been doing well?

95
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,680
- Physician Yoo! 
 - You stormed out with bravado,

96
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,060
but how can you come back alone?

97
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,480
What do you mean alone?

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,520
- We came together. 
  - What?

99
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,140
Where?

100
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,090
- Young Lady! 
 - A-Aigoo!

101
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,810
Oh, my goodness! I had no idea you were hiding there.

102
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,090
I'm so glad you came with him.

103
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,990
While you were gone, Father had so much trouble alone.

104
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,730
Yes, we even went on a break.

105
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,650
We sent all the patients to Birchwood Clinic.

106
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Young Lady, please never leave again.

107
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,040
Okay, Jang Goon.

108
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,150
I will make sure to stay here from now on.

109
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,800
By the way, while you two were at Heuksando,

110
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,000
did you not have any good news?

111
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,810
Why wouldn't they?

112
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,030
They basically got married without us at her family's house.

113
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,870
No, we didn't, yet—

114
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,810
We did not do it yet.

115
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,750
Not yet?

116
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,730
When are you going to do it, then?

117
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,280
P-Physician Yoo, you need to hurry up and tend to the patients.

118
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,410
They said Physician Gye was so busy alone.

119
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,460
- O-Oh, t-that is right. 
 - Yes, yes.

120
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,940
- There must be many patients to see. 
 - You're panicking, aren't you?

121
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,440
What's this? Things are going well for them, right?

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,500
For sure. They got closer to each other.

123
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,490
Why didn't our handsome Kang Il come with them?

124
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,570
Why would you want that froggy senselessly interrupt when things are going well for them two?

125
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,080
- He needs to go on about his business. 
 - That mouth!

126
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,720
You did what?

127
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,610
You went down, making big promises, but you were quiet all this time.

128
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,470
So I thought you made that countryside your home.

129
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,170
How could I?

130
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,010
I will get rid of that book of faults for you.

131
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,800
How can we lose the chance to end Yoo Se Yeop just because of a few petty offenses?

132
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,530
How can I trust you when you failed the inspection, too?

133
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,220
I am the only one who can come and go to Physician Gye's house anyway.

134
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,260
How could they have so many grievances against you?

135
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,060
I got it, gosh.

136
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,890
I got it!

137
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,140
Yoo Se Yeop is His Majesty's close friend.

138
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,250
Even if you cannot do it personally,

139
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,850
we must get rid of him by telling the Left State Minister.

140
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,010
Do you understand?

141
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,530
Looking at you now,

142
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,470
it seems that your hate against him is greater than mine.

143
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,970
I am curious about why that is.

144
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,450

145
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,220
Were you that anxious about the petition?

146
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,030
How could your pulse be so fleeting?

147
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,480
The petition will not be shown to Governor Ahn.

148
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,750
It is for His Majesty, so do not worry too much.

149
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,740
I brought the petition!

150
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,560
Thank you.

151
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,790
There!

152
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,220
You do not need to worry anymore.

153
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,600
Please don't burn it.

154
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,400
You said it's something that can help Physician Yoo.

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,890
- It is okay. 
 - Yes.

156
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,740
There's a mountain of it in Physician Gye's room.

157
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,320
There are many patients who like Physician Yoo.

158
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,650
All right, lie back down now.

159
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,260
If you get needle treatment and take medicine, you will be able to sleep soundly again.

160
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,700
Yes. Just leave it to us.

161
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,700
 Those who lack a sense of morals and ethics must be punished properly.

162
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,680
 But seeing how you wrote a petition

163
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,390
 you must be one of them as well.

164
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,280
 Because the physicians did nothing wrong.

165
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,900
 Also, not allowing me to go outside just because I'm a widow

166
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,340
 - is honestly just unfair. 
 - Whoa.

167
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,150
 Are the widows flocking together

168
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,250
 and making an arrogant stand as a team?

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,930
 Great, great, great.

170
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,250
 However, make sure to remember

171
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,420
 that you are not just a widow.

172
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,120
 You are also a naturalized foreigner.

173
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,400
 Did you think I would not know?

174
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,640
 It is not something you can hide.

175
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,630
 Especially your place of birth.

176
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,790
 Please spare me, Governor.

177
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,290
 Please.

178
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,180
 Please spare me.

179
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,500
 Aigoo, a quick change of attitude.

180
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,780
 I thought it was a different person.

181
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,360
 Stand up.

182
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,500
 If you just do as I say,

183
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,960
 you can survive this.

184
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,820
 W-What is this?

185
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,160
 A drug

186
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,040
 that seduces a man.

187
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,450
 Create a chance to be alone with Yoo Se Poong.

188
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,000
 At that moment, you just make him consume it.

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,880
 So easy, is it not?

190
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,100
Scorched rice. It's so delicious.

191
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,390
It's delicious, isn't it?

192
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,920
Gosh, you should

193
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,630
sit next to each other.

194
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,580
Since you came back together from the island.

195
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,480
Why are you all staring so intently?

196
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,550
You ran off after Young Lady during the busiest time

197
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,020
and slacked off the entire time.

198
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,370
And you talk so much! Granny, take away his meal.

199
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,160
You go and get yourself a wife! Instead of being jealous.

200
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,190
Poong, eat a lot.

201
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,250
That's how you prepare for future affairs.

202
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
Future affairs?

203
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,660
Future... O-Oh!

204
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,340
All right, let's eat!

205
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,770
There.

206
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,520
Good times for you two.

207
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,700
Young Lady and Half-wit, brace yourselves now.

208
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,330
I'm going to Hanyang.

209
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,310
Man Bok, preparations?

210
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,580
I got our stuff and the petition all ready.

211
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,830
You just need to walk up there with me, Physician Gye.

212
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,150
I will go with you since this is about me.

213
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,860
Hey! Imagine delivering the petitions that sing your praises and innocence

214
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,110
to the Ministry of Justice in person.

215
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,900
How awkward would it be?

216
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,380
You're seriously thoughtless.

217
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,920
You stay here and just treat the patients.

218
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,340
Okay, you can go back now.

219
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,450
You'll get better soon.

220
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,470
Physician Gye.

221
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,260
Oh, I thought you were gone for good, but you came back.

222
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,060
What would be a reason for me to run away?

223
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,770
How should I bring myself to trust you and accept you?

224
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,000
I met Governor Ahn at Moohwagak for a different business.

225
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,800
I was Physician Yoo's colleague, but

226
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,020
we never knew each other personally.

227
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,700
Hey, Froggy. Do you think I'm a fool?

228
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,260
I can see everything in your eyes, the burning fever.

229
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,140
Whenever you see Half-wit, you hide yourself

230
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,830
and watch him in secret.

231
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,170
Why the serious face?

232
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,480
Your aged and jaded self-consciousness.

233
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
Use it to better yourself, like when you sharpen your knife

234
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,460
and left for Qing to study abroad.

235
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,640
Don't use it to harm yourself needlessly.

236
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,850
 What kind of acupuncture did you give to cause her pulse to stop?

237
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,750
 He slipped while trying to show off.

238
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,300
 One,

239
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,620
 two,

240
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,080
 three.

241
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,330
 - Whoa. 
 - Aigoo!

242
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,430
 He saved her!

243
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,770
 You almost killed this patient just now.

244
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,810
 Don't give acupuncture if you are going to kill a person.

245
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:32,610
 Don't even let an unqualified physician into the palace!

246
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,930
 How did a guy like him come into the Royal Clinic?

247
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,440
 He is the son of that you-know-who.

248
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,390
 I heard it was high-handed.

249
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,490
 A high-handed appointment in the Royal Clinic? How absurd.

250
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,450
How come!

251
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,070
How come everyone trusts and cherishes Physician Yoo regardless of what is said about him,

252
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,810
but no one trusts me when I am working so hard?

253
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,980
Not even you.

254
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,090
That's because there's something you hide.

255
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,110
You'll never gain others' trust while

256
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,120
holding onto an unspeakable secret.

257
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,890
Whether it's between lovers, a student and a teacher,

258
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,210
or even between a father and a son.

259
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,240
If you feel like there's no one around you to cherish you,

260
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,110
you should look into yourself to see if there's a house

261
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,500
built on conceit and lies.

262
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,150
However, Froggy,

263
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,430
despite being tainted by the Royal Clinic,

264
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,460
you are a very skilled physician.

265
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,450
You're good with improvisations and

266
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,090
you have a lot of the virtues of a good physician.

267
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,760
I told you before, didn't I?

268
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,450
A single countryside physician can save hundreds and thousands of lives.

269
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,760
Don't waste your time looking at others.

270
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,100
Save yourself first, you fool.

271
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,940
What is it?

272
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,500
I wanted to have a deeper and more

273
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,460
intimate relationship with you, Lady Eun Woo.

274
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,670
Poong Woo Journal.

275
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,540
When I first started writing the Illness of the Heart Journal, I wrote about meeting you

276
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,610
on the very first page, Lady Eun Woo.

277
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,580
I am on your first page?

278
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,060
Since you are my first person.

279
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,900
Poong Woo Journal.

280
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,090
"Since we are together now, this journal will also be written together."

281
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,480
That is its meaning.

282
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,170
Isn't it such a good idea?

283
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,910
Yes, it is great.

284
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,810
In that case...

285
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,360

(T/N: Means "wind" in Chinese character)

286
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,600
it would fit better to use "woo" for "rain".

287
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,930
But wouldn't that lead to too much rain and wind in our future?

288
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,690
You already have too many unresolved issues as it is.

289
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,630

(T/N: Means "rain" in Chinese character)

290
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,910
I will block the rain and the wind.

291
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,580
You cannot.

292
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,800
Since you named it, so we can write this journal together,

293
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,980
we must also block the rain and the wind together.

294
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,400
I didn't think that through.

295
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,210
Lady Eun Woo, then, together.

296
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,190
Together.

297
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,840
Poong Woo Journal.

298
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,870
 If you don't do your job right,

299
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,540
 I'll send you back to your country.

300
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,860
 I'm saying I'll put you on the list of people to send back.

301
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,810
 Understood?

302
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,420
- Oh, my goodness! 
 - Hey, it's okay.

303
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,960
Let it be.

304
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,890
I'm going to clean it up.

305
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,690
Hey, if you want to sleep well,

306
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,140
you should be taking this instead of cinnamon punch.

307
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,900
I heard that even though the petition was burned,

308
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,080
you still had trouble sleeping?

309
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,650
If you drink this citron tea with honey,

310
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,490
it'll help you sleep at night.

311
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,280
Try it.

312
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Delicious, isn't it?

313
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,420
For folks who are tormented by walking on thin ice every day

314
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,820
having something nice and sweet will surely calm the soul.

315
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,460
Who wouldn't have a worry or two in their lives?

316
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,630
You better not waste a single drop before going to bed!

317
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,360
How is he going to carry this? Won't it break his back?

318
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,520
Don't even worry about this guy.

319
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,330
He's a lot bigger and stronger than you think.

320
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,020
I packed some snacks that would stun even His Majesty.

321
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,120
Use it as a bribery when something doesn't work out.

322
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
Aigoo, thank you, Namhaedaek.

323
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,740
Hey, let's hurry and leave before Half-wit begs to come along, okay?

324
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,480
Gosh, don't worry.

325
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,500
He didn't even wake up yet.

326
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,970
God knows what he was doing at night.

327
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,940
Young Lady was also deep in sleep.

328
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,690
Both of them were busy all night, huh.

329
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,840
That's right. They were both busy all night.

330
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,110
I saw them in the herb storage room.

331
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,150
- What? 
 - My... How can they, in front of a child?

332
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,660
- Why? What were they doing? 
 - Go on.

333
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,910
They didn't even sleep all night.

334
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,260
Oh, my. They might get sick.

335
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,010
What could they have been doing? It's obvious.

336
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,940
All night

337
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,600
they wrote journals for the patients.

338
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,390
Whoa, you're strong!

339
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,580
- All right, let's go now. 
 - Yes, let's hurry.

340
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,440
I made preparations to sink that physician

341
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,410
to the very bottom.

342
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,920
So you just need to sit back and relax.

343
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,420
Oh, I wasn't talking down to you.

344
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:51,040
Anyhow, what was it that you prepared?

345
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,980
An ugly rumor!

346
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,510
Did you not tell me to end him with an ugly rumor?

347
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,970
You see, I...

348
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,460
No, no. Forget it.

349
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,250
You will see when the time comes, so don't worry.

350
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,080
My goodness.

351
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,060
Why so scared?

352
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,060
You're going back home?

353
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,560
Take it.

354
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,100
It's nice and warm. What is it?

355
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,150
You'll know if you open it.

356
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,690
Try some.

357
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,540
I know your feelings all too well.

358
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,630
How hard it must have been to live in anxiety, trying to hide everything?

359
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,530
That you're a naturalized foreigner.

360
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,760
You're from my hometown, right?

361
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,410
No, who would say—

362
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,710
Do you think I wouldn't know?

363
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,250
Look at me.

364
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,080
It was so hard that I don't even bother to hide it anymore after trying for ages.

365
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,280
Come on, have some.

366
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,430
 I really didn't do it!

367
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,280
 Please trust me!

368
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,610
 Since I didn't have a home, family, or friends

369
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,880
 - I had to be good with telling the weather, at least. 
 - Please open it!

370
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,930
 I had to either tell fortunes or at least

371
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,340
  pretend to be seeing something for a bowl of rice.

372
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,940
 Although they hated me and cursed me,

373
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,790
 they liked my skills,

374
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,530
 so I made sure to work on my cooking.

375
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,740
I worked everywhere, from festive occasions to funerals.

376
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,130
It's delicious, right?

377
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,890
Yes.

378
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,140
What about when you had nowhere else to turn to?

379
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,890
There will be at least one person to hold your hand.

380
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,350
If you hold that hand and get up, you somehow get on with life.

381
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,520
I guess you had a person like that.

382
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,790
 Are you okay?

383
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,050
 I did.

384
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,260
I was able to be myself

385
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,110
after taking that hand.

386
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,140
I'm envious.

387
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,820
Any hand I try to accept

388
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,030
only wants to cut my own off.

389
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,020
Do you want to hold my hand, then?

390
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,790
You went through a lot, huh?

391
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,040
Rest at ease today.

392
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,980
I won't tell anyone that you're from my hometown.

393
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,700
Go home and sleep well.

394
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,650
Come here when you get nostalgic.

395
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,580
 Physician Gye!

396
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,250
 Man Bok!

397
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,000
Physician Gye!

398
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,830
Will those petitions truly be enough to solve the annulment issue?

399
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,710
Isn't there anything else I can do?

400
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,570
It's not only the petitions we have.

401
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,950
While you were at Heuksando,

402
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,840
I did some background checks on the Chief Royal Physician and his ilk

403
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,440
in the Royal Clinic.

404
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,730
I thought about telling you before leaving,

405
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,740
but I didn't want to worry you.

406
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,630
Since we have his weak spot,

407
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,740
he won't be able to use the false evidence to appeal His Majesty for the cancellation.

408
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,040
As long as nothing else happens.

409
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,380
Jeon Kang Il might look for this in my room.

410
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,560
I left a fake copy in my room,

411
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,110
so please watch what he does with it.

412
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,370
That's how

413
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,550
you can play a role, Young Lady.

414
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,170
Yes.

415
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,230
 I planted a spy in the clinic.

416
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,850
 It'll explode when the time comes,

417
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,520
 so just sit still and watch, please.

418
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,370

419
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,830
Physician Yoo!

420
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,190
How are you doing?

421
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,850
Did you get some sleep?

422
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,330
I'm sorry.

423
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,770
I think it'll be better for me to go home today.

424
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,490
You can do that.

425
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,720
It might be harder to sleep under an unfamiliar roof.

426
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,280
Excuse me, Physician Yoo!

427
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,210
Could you perhaps take me home, please?

428
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,560
This couldn't have been easy for you.

429
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,350
After Se Yeop lost his father and was left all alone,

430
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,820
he was always on my mind.

431
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,420
I am so glad because he has you.

432
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,950
If only I had someone I could rely on at the Royal Court too,

433
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,150
it would be such a great thing.

434
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,220
Your Majesty, that book.

435
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,150
Please do not read it yet.

436
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,050
Why do you say that?

437
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,800
In that book

438
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,300
not a single unforgivable crime exists.

439
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,480
Although I put that book together,

440
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,390
who in this world would not have a fault or two?

441
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,430
It is merely a useful item to bring up

442
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,610
when you're trying to acquit Physician Yoo,

443
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,120
and people continue to try to harm him with false accusations.

444
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,860
So I shouldn't read it right now?

445
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

446
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,030
If you read in detail about the petty crimes of people you need to keep by your side,

447
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,350
I am worried that you might be overcome

448
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,230
with loathing whenever you see them.

449
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,330
So please set it aside for now and

450
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,760
use it should the need arise.

451
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,560
Taking even my heart into consideration,

452
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,890
you and Se Yeop are very much alike.

453
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,170
Very well. I heard the petitions from the people of Sorak County

454
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,580
stacked as tall as a person's height.

455
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,700
Yes.

456
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,140
I safely delivered them to the Ministry of Justice before meeting you.

457
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,180
That's a relief.

458
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,300
Even as the king,

459
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,770
I was unable to silence the fiery appeals

460
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,720
to nullify his works.

461
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,080
Now, as long as another disaster doesn't come along,

462
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,680
I will be able to acquit Se Yeop, it seems.

463
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,800
I am deeply thankful for your trust, Your Majesty.

464
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,890
Please be extra careful until it becomes a complete non-issue.

465
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

466
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,410
P-Physician Yoo.

467
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:47,190
If you sit here for a second, I'll get ready right away.

468
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,000
What are you getting ready for?

469
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,820
Well, I really wanted to treat you to a meal.

470
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,270
N-No, I am fine.

471
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,140
Thieves come once they realize a widow is living alone here.

472
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,300
I can only imagine how difficult it must've been

473
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,580
to survive on your own.

474
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,600
Life is like that every day.

475
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,950
I also understand those feelings, at least a little.

476
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,640
Everyone points their swords at you,

477
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,200
threatens you, and harasses you, probably.

478
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,060
And the thought that you're completely alone

479
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,880
fills you with resentment.

480
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,100
Perhaps, do you feel like you are

481
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,660
standing on the edge of a cliff right now?

482
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,280
Nothing is really your fault,

483
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,100
so I hope you will not ever blame yourself.

484
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,610
Also, make sure to look around you.

485
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,560
When you're in desperate agony,

486
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,800
you won't even notice the hand reaching toward you.

487
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,270
Because someone might already be extending a warm helping hand to you right now.

488
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,690
 Mak Jin, come here!

489
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,470
 For folks who are tormented by walking on thin ice every day,

490
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,870
 having something nice and sweet will surely calm the soul.

491
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,880
 I know your feelings all too well.

492
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,570
 How hard it must have been to live in anxiety, trying to hide everything?

493
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:23,070
Whatever is causing you to suffer and lose sleep like this,

494
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,660
I promise to get to the bottom of it.

495
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,390
Even if it takes some time,

496
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,860
I will not give up until the end.

497
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,040
Physician Yoo.

498
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,490
Physician Yoo, I'm sorry.

499
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,410
H-How did it go, huh?

500
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,840
Did you feed him the aphrodisiac?

501
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,310
The aphrodisiac.

502
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,620
You fed it to him, right?

503
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,350
Y-You must have, right?

504
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,610
Why the heck are you not answering me?

505
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,700
I cannot do it.

506
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,190
I won't!

507
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,510
What?

508
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,250
Gosh, damn it!

509
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,860
Do you really want to die?

510
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,140
Please don't do this.

511
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,650
Physician Yoo is a good person.

512
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,970
I'm also a good person!

513
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,690
A wench like you...

514
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,830
You will be sent right back to your country.

515
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:11,450
I'm going to write your name at the top of the list.

516
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,740
You cannot do that.

517
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,390
I'm going to tell everyone everything.

518
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,130
I'm going to keep living here in Sorak County!

519
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,930
How dare you!

520
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,080
Let go!

521
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,080
Come here.

522
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,910
Physician Yoo.

523
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,220
Have you seen Lady Eun Woo?

524
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,110
She has been missing since earlier.

525
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,550
That's what I'm saying.

526
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,380
We also thought it was weird.

527
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,740
But she's not in her room, the guest room, nor the kitchen.

528
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,810
She's nowhere to be seen.

529
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,960
Now that I think about it, Inspector Physician was also missing.

530
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,060
Aigoo, they must be on an urgent house call.

531
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,300
What's that in your hand?

532
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,010
 Physician Yoo, I'm sorry.

533
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:59,800
It seems Mak Jin tried to drug me.

534
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,410
What are you talking about?

535
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,270
L-Let me see that.

536
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:14,120
This is an aphrodisiac, isn't it?

537
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,340
Are you saying she was trying to seduce you?

538
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,000
Seduce?

539
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,320
Wait, Namhaedaek, isn't she from the same place as you?

540
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,160
She's a naturalized foreigner.

541
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,100
Did she say anything while I was away?

542
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,810
How did you know?

543
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,720
She had changed her accent flawlessly.

544
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,730
Wait a minute.

545
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,710
She wasn't from Sorak County? You knew about this?

546
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,230
Of course, I knew.

547
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,760
Even if she worked hard to change her accent,

548
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,730
there's still a trace of her old dialect.

549
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:43,420
Aigoo, how'd you find out about our secret?

550
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,660
This definitely isn't right.

551
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,060
There must be something wrong.

552
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,470
Governor Ahn, that bastard, shouldn't be this quiet.

553
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,670
He could've tried to blackmail Mak Jin

554
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,760
by using the fact that she's a naturalized foreigner.

555
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,570
Now that you mention it, I heard another repatriation request came from Qing.

556
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,250
He could've used that as a threat.

557
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,690
Yes. That could be it!

558
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,570
Governor Ahn, that bastard, was trying to make

559
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,350
the scandal in his petition come true!

560
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,600
What about Lady Eun Woo?

561
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,250
Could that be related to why she hasn't come back?

562
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,710
 Jeon Kang Il might look for this in my room.

563
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,930
 I left a fake copy in my room,

564
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:34,570
 so please watch what he does with it.

565
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:38,730
 That's how you can play a role, Young Lady.

566
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,290
- Young Lady! 
 - Young Lady!

567
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,560
Young Lady!

568
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,450
Jang Goon, this way.

569
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,280
- Young Lady! 
 - Young Lady!

570
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,050
Let's go that way.

571
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,810
Young Lady!

572
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,270
Young Lady—

573
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,950
- Young Lady! 
 - Bride! Bride—

574
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,410
It's this way!

575
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,710
Bride!

576
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,020
- We went that way before. 
 - What?

577
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,110
- That way, that way. 
 - No, this is—

578
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,420
- Where is she? 
 - Young Lady.

579
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,820
- Jang Goon, come this way. 
 - Physician Gye!

580
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,220
Yes, yes.

581
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,480
She wasn't on that side, either?

582
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,750
She didn't come out to the market today.

583
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,310
Aigoo, where did she go?

584
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,460
Young Lady!

585
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,450
- Young Lady! 
 - Young Lady!

586
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,080
Where the heck did she go?

587
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,660
Man Bok, you go look around the market.

588
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,430
I am going to look around the mountainside.

589
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,710
Young Master, please be careful.

590
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,520
Go, go now.

591
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,030
Young Lady!

592
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,640
It's me.

593
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,250
What the hell is this?

594
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,280
I told you not to act rashly, didn't I?

595
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,100
Is she the woman?

596
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,670
What are you going to do now?

597
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,140
If I just bury this corpse,

598
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,600
no one will know for now.

599
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:25,130
How can a so-called governor harm a citizen?

600
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:27,650
Look who's talking!

601
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,730
A scandalous widow who has an affair with a physician.

602
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,170
How dare you lecture me?

603
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:42,320
I just need to silence you forever.

604
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,840
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

605
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,500
Everything is over now, Governor Ahn.

606
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,670
You are only adding to your crime!

607
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,490
Stop ordering me around!

608
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,460
Please stop it now!

609
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,750
Please!

610
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,810
You!

611
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,420
Physician Jeon!

612
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,690
Shit.

613
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,920
Run away! Right now!

614
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,540
Hurry up and go!

615
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,890
Go and bring people!

616
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,650
Having trouble breathing?

617
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:31,860
Aigoo, it's about time you're quiet!

618
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,320
No!

619
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,010
Lady Eun Woo.

620
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,210
Lady Eun Woo.

621
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,480
Lady Eun Woo!

622
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,750
Please.

623
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:12,880
P-Please.

624
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:34,620

625
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:45,340
♫  I guess I was also like you  ♫

626
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:51,770
♫  Just like how you are right now  ♫

627
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:57,910
♫  Like a wandering bird  ♫

628
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:02,470
♫  who has lost their way  ♫

629
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:07,520
♫  Please tell me now  ♫

630
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:14,800
♫  All the loneliness in your heart  ♫

631
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,860
♫  Please tell me now  ♫

632
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:26,580
♫  All your painful sighs  ♫
