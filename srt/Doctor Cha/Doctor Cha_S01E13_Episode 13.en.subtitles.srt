1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,179
And then suddenly,

3
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,681
I had this thought.

4
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,187
All of this isn't just your fault.

5
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,691
Your mother failed
to teach you right from wrong.

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:12,614
And I was so permissive
in every single regard.

7
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,159
Our responsibility in this isn't any less.

8
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,578
Yes.

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,413
I've made my decision.

10
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,750
I think the time has come

11
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:29,464
when it'll be okay if we're just
Jung-min and I-rang's parents.

12
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,134
As the father of my children,
I can let things slide.

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,636
But…

14
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,056
as my husband,

15
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,017
you no longer…

16
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,686
hold any meaning to me.

17
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,024
I don't want to hate you anymore.

18
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,902
I just don't feel the need
to hate you anymore.

19
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,196
It's already over…

20
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,574
between the two of us.

21
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,203
Let's get a divorce.

22
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,896
Don't put on an act.

23
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,773
Get up.

24
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,817
Get up!

25
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,577
Honey.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,287
Honey, open your eyes, okay?

27
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,164
What's with you?

28
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,206
Wake up.

29
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,208
-Honey!
-What's wrong, In-ho?

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,335
-In-ho!
-Dad! What's wrong?

31
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,795
-Are you okay? In-ho!
-Wait.

32
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,422
-Hurry up and call 911.
-Okay.

33
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,090
In-ho.

34
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,550
What's wrong with him?

35
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,268
What on earth happened to him?

36
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,979
-Mother.
-What?

37
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,023
Please go get me a bucket of water.

38
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,442
Do we even have a bucket?

39
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,818
I'll get some water.

40
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,736
Okay.

41
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,696
In-ho.

42
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,657
What's wrong? Why is your nose bleeding?

43
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:21,951
Here.

44
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,953
Mom.

45
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,129
Looks as if he just opened his eyes.

46
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,589
In-ho!

47
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,842
Are you okay? Do you recognize me?

48
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,970
-Yes. The address here is…
-I-rang.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,807
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,644
Yes, I think we're okay here.

51
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,773
Yes, thank you.

52
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,984
EPISODE 13

53
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,457
-Are you going to the hospital?
-I have to.

54
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,800
If you have something to say, say it.

55
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,600
Please forgive me.

56
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,271
Think of all the years
we've been together.

57
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,939
We shouldn't end things like this.

58
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,401
I was ending things with Seung-hi too.

59
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,403
It's almost done now.

60
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,407
I was going to spend the rest of my life
repenting for the things I've done to you.

61
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,369
You can't just end it like this.

62
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,495
I don't want…

63
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,832
to get a divorce.

64
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,166
Honey.

65
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,960
Your effort is admirable.

66
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,964
But this isn't something that can be
solved by you begging on your knees.

67
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,259
A divorce?

68
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,845
How could you decide this on your own?

69
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,140
How could you not even bother
to discuss such a huge matter

70
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,392
with me, the other party involved?

71
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,645
I've already made my decision.

72
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,564
I don't want to discuss it with you.

73
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,858
This is a notice.

74
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,235
A divorce notice.

75
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,535
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,578
Divorce?

77
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,622
-What do you mean, divorce?
-Mother, it's not that.

78
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,540
Yes, Mother.

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,711
I'm sorry to give you this news
today of all days.

80
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,338
But we've decided…

81
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,632
to go our separate ways.

82
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,596
Is that why you fainted?

83
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,974
Because you were shocked
when she said she wanted to divorce?

84
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,357
I would've died alongside your father

85
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,526
if I had known I'd have to witness this.

86
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,445
I can't live with this.

87
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,448
I can't live like this!

88
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,535
Divorce at this age?

89
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,120
Grandma, please get up.

90
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,538
Let go of me!

91
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,958
You both are on your mother's side.

92
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,711
Grandma, it's not like that.

93
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,880
We're only now
learning about the divorce too.

94
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,257
-Grandma.
-Let go!

95
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,140
I'd understand if you two were young,
but you aren't.

96
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,852
If it were me,
I would find divorce too bothersome.

97
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,312
You two must be full of energy.

98
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,564
You're dating at your age.

99
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,526
What makes you think she wouldn't have
the energy for a divorce?

100
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,321
In-ho.

101
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,032
Did you give Seung-hi child support?

102
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,576
Hurry up, give her the money,
and wrap things up.

103
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,789
Jeong-suk might change her mind
if she knows it's over between you two.

104
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,749
She wouldn't accept it anyway.

105
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,709
She would probably laugh at my face.

106
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,710
I guess so.

107
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,879
She's from a rich family.
She wouldn't accept such a petty sum.

108
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,216
Her father probably
cherished his granddaughter.

109
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,552
It wasn't like that either.

110
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,512
When she gave birth to Eun-seo,

111
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,140
her father abandoned her,
so they lived like strangers.

112
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,310
She finally met him again
right before he passed away.

113
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,520
He passed away recently.

114
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,856
It must have been tough for her too.

115
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,818
Then what happened to all his assets?

116
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,069
Did she not inherit anything?

117
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,404
I don't know the details,

118
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,114
but her father didn't leave a will,

119
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,450
so she probably split it in half
with her brother.

120
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,994
Half? How much were all the assets worth?

121
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,538
I'm not sure,

122
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,123
but…

123
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,542
wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

124
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,504
One hundred…

125
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,256
billion won?

126
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,175
I know you were surprised.

127
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,678
But it probably wasn't something
totally unexpected.

128
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,181
You both are all grown up too.

129
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,767
So you probably thought
something like this could happen.

130
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,732
It might be too early to talk about this,

131
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,985
but I want to hear your thoughts
on this situation.

132
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,905
What kind of thoughts?

133
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,242
Jung-min, you're a working adult,
so I'm not worried about you.

134
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,038
You can live in the hospital dorms
until you finish your residency.

135
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,039
Right?

136
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,708
I-rang, what do you want to do?

137
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,546
If you want to live with me,
I can find us a place to live.

138
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,050
If you want to stay here,
then that's fine too.

139
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,888
I guess things like that
need to be decided too.

140
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,892
It's not urgent,
so take your time to think about it.

141
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,560
Okay.

142
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,151
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,740
It would've been nice
if this didn't have to happen, right?

144
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,536
No. It's okay, Mom.

145
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,429
Everything will work out.

146
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,265
So don't worry.

147
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,141
Okay.

148
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,726
It's late.

149
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,478
Goodnight.

150
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:13,195
DRIVER WITH DISABILITY

151
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,946
Have a good day, sir.

152
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,119
APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE
BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT

153
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,997
JUNG-MIN'S DAD
IMAGE

154
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,629
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

155
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,507
HAVE SOME BREAKFAST BEFORE GOING TO WORK

156
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,056
Jeez.

157
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,814
Good morning.

158
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,107
Professor Seo.

159
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,486
About Yoo Ji-seon's guardian
wanting to sue Seo Jung-min.

160
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,321
They've decided not to sue.

161
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,284
It could have caused us some trouble
but it's a relief.

162
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,870
Yes?

163
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,373
-Goodbye, sir.
-Yes.

164
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,378
It looks like Professor Roy
smoothed things out as an intermediary.

165
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,965
Judging by how he did all that
despite not being on good terms with you,

166
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,968
he must be a really great guy.

167
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,885
I suppose.

168
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,513
You two should have a drink
and get over your animosity.

169
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,641
And you should thank him
for what he did here.

170
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,018
You are both talented members
of our department.

171
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,645
It wouldn't do to stay enemies.

172
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,106
Right.

173
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,026
But have you made up
with Chief Lim of Family Medicine?

174
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,738
You even punched each other
the other day in the ER.

175
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,290
Our relationship is more nuanced
and complicated than yours.

176
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,503
You used almost all the shampoo,
but the conditioner was new.

177
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,005
I'm a first-year.

178
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,132
It's hard to find time
even to use conditioner.

179
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,135
Thank you for this.

180
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,345
Right.

181
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,307
Are you having any luck
looking for your family?

182
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,684
I just was on my way
to the police station.

183
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,060
To register my DNA.

184
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,479
I see.

185
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,688
Good luck.

186
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,983
Well…

187
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:57,902
Dr. Cha.

188
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,031
Ms. Yoo Ji-seon's mother

189
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,494
wanted me to relay a message to you.

190
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,814
What brings you here, Doctor?

191
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,108
Today seemed to be
the last day of the funeral.

192
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,570
I wanted to say one last goodbye.

193
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,574
My deepest apologies.

194
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,045
From one parent to another,

195
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,506
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

196
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,092
To tell you the truth…

197
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,347
The resident who discharged her
came before too.

198
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,015
He left after crying on his knees.

199
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,727
But doing that won't bring our child back.

200
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,690
I want to explain to you
why your daughter died.

201
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,192
I don't want to hear it, so please leave.

202
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,281
Honey.

203
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,448
Let's hear it.

204
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,158
Honey.

205
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,076
Let's hear him out

206
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,453
just this once.

207
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,456
We're Ji-seon's parents.

208
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,458
We should know.

209
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,252
I need to know…

210
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,797
before I'll be able to send her off.

211
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,895
She had a type of cancer
that was difficult to treat.

212
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:02,776
To tell you the truth,
I just needed someone to blame.

213
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,824
I think I even wanted to grab onto
the doctors who were trying to save her

214
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,829
so I could have someone
to blame for my daughter's death.

215
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,798
It's not your fault, Doctor.

216
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,051
I know that.

217
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:31,931
No.

218
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,767
It's my fault too.

219
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,896
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,615
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,327
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,053
Thank you so much

223
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,848
for all your effort, Dr. Kim.

224
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,350
If you're grateful to me,

225
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,310
make me one promise.

226
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,522
A promise?

227
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,190
You missed your regular checkup.

228
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,734
Right.

229
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,069
You should hurry up

230
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,696
and come to me.

231
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,383
MY LOVE TO YOU

232
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,384
Let's get married.

233
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,140
Yes!

234
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,144
I know

235
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,229
I'm going to die.

236
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,773
You know how sometimes

237
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,443
you just get this feeling?

238
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,194
That's how I feel.

239
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,238
So…

240
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,991
I really want to save my baby.

241
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,080
If my mom and dad raise my baby,

242
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,419
they'll sometimes forget
that I'm no longer with them.

243
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:28,881
And sometimes…

244
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,343
there'll be days
when this baby will make them smile.

245
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,597
My baby can find out who her father is

246
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,183
when she is a little older.

247
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,518
He's not someone
who will turn his back on her.

248
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,066
Still,

249
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,193
you should tell someone

250
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,320
who the baby's father is.

251
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,826
To tell you the truth,
I gave my dad a little hint.

252
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,834
I promise to cherish you
for the rest of our lives.

253
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,714
My darling wife.

254
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,308
This is a notice.

255
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,601
A divorce notice.

256
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,189
Professor Seo?

257
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
Professor Seo?

258
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,777
Are you all right?

259
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,779
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,073
Goodness, no reason to be sorry.

261
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,368
Mr. Yang Gwi-ja?

262
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,245
Pardon?

263
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,123
Professor Seo.

264
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,209
That was the patient right before.

265
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,586
This patient is Mr. Park Myeong-u.

266
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,880
I'm sorry.
I confused you for someone else.

267
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,634
Professor Seo, you must be very tired.

268
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,846
I'm okay.

269
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,195
-Professor Seo, are you okay?
-No, I'm not.

270
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,990
You can't sit here like this.

271
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,119
Come this way.

272
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,001
I really can't take this.

273
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,752
Get it together.

274
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,881
Why did you do something you'd regret?

275
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,882
Jung-min.

276
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,467
Can you persuade your mother?

277
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,678
She won't even listen to me.

278
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,432
I know it's shameless, but please?

279
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,225
Put yourself in her shoes.

280
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,978
If Mom had a kid with another man,

281
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,813
would you be able to forgive her?

282
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,278
Are you okay?

283
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,988
I'm not okay either.

284
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,324
I'm thinking about
what I should do going forward.

285
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,035
Like what?

286
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,077
Well…

287
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,913
I'll tell you once I've decided.

288
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,833
Why?

289
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,293
What is it?

290
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,672
Is it a secret you can't tell me?
You can just tell me.

291
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,634
It's lunchtime.

292
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,802
You should eat.

293
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,731
Where should we sit?

294
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,191
Over there.

295
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,109
Chief Lim, please sit over here.

296
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,036
Please have a seat.

297
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,709
Hey, the braised tofu is good today.

298
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,003
You like braised tofu.

299
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,630
What's with you?

300
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,050
Why? Did Bong-suk say
she'd only date you if we made up?

301
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,470
No, I just saw the braised tofu
and was reminded of how you like it.

302
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,888
What a load of crap.

303
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,348
You always try to run away

304
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,891
if anything bad happens.

305
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,935
The same goes for this time too.

306
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:10,978
Don't you agree?

307
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,398
Yes, I was disappointed by
how the Surgery Department responded.

308
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,025
The same goes for the donation last time.

309
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,070
That was all thanks to
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk from my department.

310
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,822
Your department didn't do anything.

311
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,699
But you scooped up
two robotic surgical systems

312
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,075
that are 5 billion won each.

313
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,287
What do you mean by "scooped up"?

314
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,831
-We just accepted the offer.
-That's the same thing.

315
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,126
How shameless,
without even a trace of conscience.

316
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,420
Take them then!

317
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,547
I've had enough of this pettiness.

318
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,799
Do you even know how to use the robots?

319
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,384
What?

320
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,095
Are you slandering every professor
of Family Medicine in the country?

321
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,306
All you know how to do is surgery!

322
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,516
-I know a lot of things!
-Tell me!

323
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,060
We perform enemas, take out excrement,
and realign bones!

324
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,438
We make weird faces like yours
look presentable!

325
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,273
-What?
-Do you want to be slapped with tofu?

326
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,190
Try it!

327
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,318
I'm going
to smash your face into the tofu!

328
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,777
We have things to talk about.

329
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,237
-Did you spit at me?
-That's right.

330
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,081
I'm sorry about the incident with my son.

331
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,125
I have no excuses to give.

332
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,918
You were trying to protect your son.

333
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,254
I could understand.

334
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,840
But I want you to remember one thing.

335
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:23,967
Eun-seo…

336
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,053
is your child too.

337
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,098
If something ever happens to Eun-seo,
be on her side no matter what.

338
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,516
Just like you were with Jung-min.

339
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,143
Sure.

340
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,644
I will.

341
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,313
Then it's fine.

342
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,231
Let's pretend this didn't happen.

343
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,233
Really?

344
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,110
Are you forgiving me?

345
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,448
-Yes.
-Even when I was like that to you?

346
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,116
You're really okay with it?

347
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,160
Do I look like I'm okay?

348
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,454
Though I forgive you,

349
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,331
you should be taught a lesson,

350
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,832
don't you think?

351
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,003
I heard Professor Roy Kim
helped with this incident.

352
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,671
That's what they say.

353
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,174
What did your wife say?

354
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,301
There's no way she just forgave you.

355
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,221
She wants a divorce.

356
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,057
And?

357
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,642
She probably said it out of anger.

358
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,645
I'll try my best to make her feel better.

359
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,565
Fine.

360
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,484
Do everything you can.

361
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,444
That way, you won't regret it.

362
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,404
What do you expect me to do then?

363
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,574
I told you I'll be the one to end things.

364
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,326
Try to persuade your wife.

365
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,036
I'll wait for you.

366
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,205
After all, I've waited for you
this whole time.

367
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,709
Use this opportunity
to play the role of a good husband.

368
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,003
You should do what all the others do.

369
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:19,416
ROY KIM

370
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,967
I heard that the Yoo Ji-seon incident
was resolved thanks to you.

371
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,094
-Thank you.
-Well,

372
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,555
I didn't do it to receive your thanks.

373
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,184
Then who did you do it for?

374
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,146
It wasn't for anyone.

375
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,565
I just did my duty as a doctor.

376
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,152
I think righting a wrong
is the proper thing to do.

377
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,406
And there shouldn't be anyone
who feels wronged by this situation.

378
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,619
Professor Kim, it seems
you're not very honest either.

379
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,542
Seo Jung-min.

380
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,339
-Hello, Chief Yoon.
-You punk.

381
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,342
Why do you look so down
when everything has been resolved?

382
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,677
It's okay.

383
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,388
You need experiences like this one
to become a real doctor.

384
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,473
Don't you think?

385
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,390
That's right.

386
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,560
Dr. Seo, don't be too discouraged.

387
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,812
Just think of it as a learning experience.

388
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,606
Cheer up.

389
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,487
A learning experience?

390
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,078
Hey, Seo Jung-min.

391
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,830
I heard the patient's guardian
isn't taking you to court.

392
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,165
What a huge relief.

393
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:43,917
A relief?

394
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,712
-Why is it a relief?
-Why are you being so sensitive?

395
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,756
I'm just saying
since it was resolved well--

396
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,758
Hey, don't say it like that.

397
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,093
Resolved?

398
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,844
A relief?

399
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,317
You can do exactly as written here.

400
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,402
Yes, Doctor.

401
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,284
That's an expression
I don't see every day.

402
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,244
You seem very angry.

403
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,663
Everyone seems carefree except for me.

404
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,415
What does that mean?

405
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,542
They try to comfort me
by telling me it's okay.

406
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,004
But I feel like I'm about to go crazy
hearing everyone say that.

407
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,339
How is any of this okay?

408
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,799
Is it okay just because they're unscathed?

409
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,758
And…

410
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,969
should it even be okay?

411
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,888
I definitely shouldn't be feeling okay.

412
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,307
This is why I like you.

413
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,437
You don't try to justify things
in a petty way or wallow in self-pity.

414
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,856
You're good at putting yourself
in others' shoes.

415
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,065
What?

416
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,445
Follow me.

417
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,046
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

418
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,595
The sky is especially pretty today.
It suddenly made me think of you.

419
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,014
He's unbelievable.

420
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,430
Are they filming an adult movie or what?

421
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,307
My goodness.

422
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,392
Kids these days.

423
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:06,976
Jeez.

424
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,114
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

425
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,907
WOMEN'S AND JUVENILE AFFAIRS DIVISION

426
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,206
Hello.

427
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,375
What can I help you with?

428
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,435
Were there cases where biological parents
have been found this way?

429
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,187
The probability of international adoptees
finding their biological parents

430
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,522
is quite low, to be honest.

431
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,524
About 1%?

432
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,360
If the parents register their DNA,

433
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,320
then a match can be made quickly.

434
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,906
But that isn't the case a lot of the time.

435
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,783
I see.

436
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,369
But there's been
a lot of publicity about this lately.

437
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,831
There are parents who register their DNA
to look for their children.

438
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,500
You see it on the news sometimes.

439
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,091
I broke my collarbone
and had to be admitted to the hospital.

440
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,969
But even in this situation,
I missed you all so much

441
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,554
that I decided to do this live.

442
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,640
I look pretty even in hospital clothes?

443
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,517
Thank you.

444
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,227
Right. Everyone, give me a second.

445
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,567
-Doctor!
-Hello.

446
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,070
Doctor, say hello.

447
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,115
You shouldn't be moving like this.

448
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,159
Doctor, please say hello to my followers.

449
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,453
LOVE YOU NA-RA!
YOU'RE SO CUTE

450
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,496
HELLO
HI FROM MALAYSIA

451
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,623
How many followers do you have?

452
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,668
Out of 500,000,
about 2,000 are here right now.

453
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,711
Two thousand?

454
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,255
My doctor needs to get ready too.

455
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,965
Put this on, Doctor.

456
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,092
Hurry.

457
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,469
-This?
-Yes.

458
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,386
Like this.

459
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,351
-Like this.
-Okay.

460
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,478
-Is that enough?
-Yes.

461
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,314
-Let's take a look now, shall we?
-Okay, bye.

462
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,444
I'm Cha Jeong-suk. Bye, everyone.

463
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,865
Everyone, isn't my doctor beautiful?
Her skin is so moist and amazing.

464
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,784
-Doctor, it's amazing.
-Thank you.

465
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,370
I'm sorry, but you shouldn't
be moving about.

466
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,996
Please lie down so you can get treated.

467
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,373
Menopause?

468
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,502
I came here because I couldn't perform
at night with my wife,

469
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,254
so what do you mean by menopause?

470
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,589
Doesn't that only happen to women?

471
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,590
No.

472
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,511
When testosterone,
the male hormone, decreases,

473
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,972
you can experience similar symptoms
to female menopause,

474
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,517
including the symptom
that you're currently experiencing.

475
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,270
Simply put, it's male menopause.

476
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,731
We need to check if you're suffering from
a lack of hormones,

477
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,983
so we'll do a blood test.

478
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,777
This is quite embarrassing and strange.

479
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,530
Gosh, there's no need to feel that way.

480
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:09,576
Even my husband has been losing his hair
and getting a frozen shoulder.

481
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,828
And his mood keeps swinging
back and forth.

482
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,708
I don't know how he's doing in bed though.

483
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,213
Sorry, I was thinking of something else.

484
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,131
No.

485
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,634
It's comforting to know that your husband
is going through similar things.

486
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,635
Right?

487
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,679
It's the same for everyone.

488
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,931
-I'll just do a blood test.
-Okay.

489
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,977
The cops found him passed out
on the street.

490
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,980
He smells of alcohol,
and his hygiene isn't good either.

491
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,441
His blood sugar is at 650,
and his abdomen is filled with fluid.

492
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,569
He seems to be addicted to alcohol
with liver cirrhosis and diabetes

493
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,696
that wasn't regulated,
which caused diabetic ketoacidosis.

494
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,700
Can he be admitted if we request
a consultation with Family Medicine?

495
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,577
Wouldn't it be better
to consult Gastroenterology

496
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,621
or Endocrinology,
instead of Family Medicine?

497
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,750
The professors and residents
are on vacation,

498
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,460
so they can't accept more patients.

499
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,920
They asked me to consult
another department.

500
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,798
Okay, put in the consultation request.
I'll notify the professor.

501
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,883
Okay.

502
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,844
We'll also need to consult
with social services, right?

503
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,012
You're amazing.

504
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,847
Thank you.

505
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,890
It's nothing.

506
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,268
Sir, are you awake?

507
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,269
Where am I?

508
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,437
This is the hospital.

509
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,773
Where does it hurt the most?

510
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,957
You only work for two days a week.
Is it still too hard on you?

511
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,336
You're so popular among the elderly.

512
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,796
It's too bad.

513
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,715
I would continue if I could.

514
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,636
But I'm not well right now,
so what can I do?

515
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,763
You were doing so well
earning extra money.

516
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,890
If you quit now, it'll be a waste.

517
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,977
I get a small amount from my pension,

518
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,938
and my daughter started working,
so she sends me money too.

519
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:08,361
Then you can enroll in health insurance
under your daughter's name.

520
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,946
That's true!

521
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,999
Hey, Mom.

522
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,922
That lady is obsessed
with working these days.

523
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,425
Why is she working so hard
and being overly friendly?

524
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,093
She's making us look bad.

525
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,679
I know, did something good happen
to her recently?

526
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,765
But still, I'm worried
she's pushing herself too hard.

527
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,768
Hey, I was calling to tell you

528
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,982
that I'm going to quit
working as a care worker.

529
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,191
Really?

530
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,402
That's great!

531
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,112
Jeez.

532
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,741
You would throw a fit
when I told you to quit.

533
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,243
What changed your mind?

534
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,080
Mom,

535
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,041
are you sick?

536
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,627
No, I just want to take up some hobbies.

537
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,215
I want to learn how to draw
and how to play the harmonica too.

538
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,676
I don't think that's the reason.

539
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,888
Jeez, it's fine. There's no need to nag.

540
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,515
Since you have a job,

541
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,977
I can get health insurance
under your name, right?

542
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,978
I forgot!

543
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,396
That's right.

544
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,190
Why didn't I think of that?

545
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,193
That's great.
That takes care of one of my worries.

546
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,819
Mom.

547
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,529
Is your shoulder still not better?

548
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,448
Is it really bad?

549
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,200
It's because I'm old.

550
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:42,455
Someone told me to try acupressure,
so I'm on my way to do that.

551
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,416
It'll get better eventually
if I try different things.

552
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,131
DIVORCE APPLICATION
(APPOINTMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS)

553
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,763
WIFE: CHA JEONG-SUK

554
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,895
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

555
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:19,075
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

556
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,410
What is he trying to do?

557
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,039
I BOUGHT SOME SALT BUTTER ROLLS
AFTER SEEING THEM MADE ME THINK OF YOU

558
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:30,419
BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE THE SALT OF MY LIFE…

559
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,194
This isn't going to be solved
with baked goods.

560
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,280
It's too weak.

561
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,293
Goodness.

562
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,254
Goodness.

563
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,431
Mom.

564
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,517
Did she go somewhere?

565
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,269
Mom.

566
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,440
Mom, are you sleeping?

567
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,358
Goodness.

568
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,320
Mom.

569
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,446
Mom, are you in pain?

570
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,530
What's wrong?

571
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,283
Jeez, I'm fine. Don't make a fuss.

572
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,828
What do you mean? You can't even move.

573
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,663
Let's go to the hospital.

574
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,583
I had acupressure in the afternoon,

575
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,628
and I think it was too strong.

576
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,255
I took a pain reliever,
so I'll get better.

577
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,135
Every hospital says something different.

578
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,847
A shot to relax the muscles.
A steroid shot.

579
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,225
I've gotten every shot there is.

580
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:11,562
I've received acupuncture and acupressure.
I did everything I could.

581
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,773
None of them helped.

582
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,361
Taking pain relievers
is what makes things bearable.

583
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,572
If I feel better, I stop taking them.

584
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,783
But the pain comes back and I can't sleep.

585
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,537
You've lost a lot of weight too.

586
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,750
I have no appetite since I can't sleep.

587
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,710
So I just naturally lost weight.

588
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,798
I've been all over the place.

589
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,967
I didn't even know you were sick.

590
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,804
You should have told me!

591
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,599
It's because I knew you'd worry.
You're busy enough as is.

592
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,770
But…

593
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,898
why did you come without telling me?

594
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,650
Is something wrong?

595
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,071
There's nothing wrong. I just came.

596
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,572
Just came, my foot.

597
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,077
I also thought it was strange last time
when you just showed up late at night.

598
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,621
Is there really nothing wrong?

599
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,165
What could be wrong?

600
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,334
Just focus on getting better.

601
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,794
Come to my hospital tomorrow.

602
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,296
Don't you dare say you won't.

603
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,678
Ms. Oh Deok-rye.

604
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:29,223
You do have a supraspinatus
partial thickness tear.

605
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,018
But it's not bad enough
to require surgery.

606
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,978
It might get better with an injection.

607
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,896
You say you're aching all over,

608
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,940
but it's not like
we can check your whole body.

609
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,484
I looked at your joints
through the ultrasound,

610
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,861
and nothing was wrong.

611
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,821
Your BDI is around 30.

612
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,408
Based on your screening, you're severely
depressed due to chronic pain.

613
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,925
Mom.

614
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,011
What are you doing?

615
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,221
I'm just sitting here.

616
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,807
I'm living a life of luxury thanks to you.

617
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,644
How's being in a hospital a luxury?

618
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,898
Still, I can be in a private room
like this because of you.

619
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:24,236
I think the nurses are nicer to me
because I'm your mother

620
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,946
and In-ho's mother-in-law.

621
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,615
That's not it.

622
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,909
The nurses in my department
are always friendly.

623
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,498
Mother!

624
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,334
In-ho, what brings you all the way here?

625
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,837
My mother-in-law has been admitted.
Of course I should come.

626
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,010
Mother. Gosh, my hands are cold.

627
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,848
Mother, please don't worry
about anything anymore.

628
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:57,269
I'll call all my fellow professors
so you'll get better in no time.

629
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:58,896
Okay.

630
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,189
Sure, thank you.

631
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,865
My mother-in-law
was admitted to the hospital.

632
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,158
Please.

633
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,160
Look into it and call me back.

634
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:14,912
Thanks.

635
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,127
I'm friends with Professor Yang U-seok
of the Pain Medicine Department.

636
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,086
He's very talented.

637
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,713
He'll call back right away, so let's wait.

638
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,631
Sure.

639
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,675
Thanks.

640
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,593
There's no need.

641
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,348
You didn't tell

642
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,642
your mother anything, right?

643
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,018
Tell her what?

644
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,104
That we're getting divorced?

645
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,689
Watch what you say.

646
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,903
You acted like the world would end
if anyone found out we were married.

647
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,948
So why did you suddenly want to speak
where everyone can see us?

648
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,284
I mean, aren't we getting divorced?

649
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,287
To be exact, we're not getting divorced.

650
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,581
You just suggested it,
but I never accepted it.

651
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,124
Whatever.

652
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,501
Don't let my mom know
what's going on between us for now.

653
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,752
Of course.

654
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,004
I'll…

655
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,965
I'll be good to your mother too, honey.

656
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,967
Don't fool yourself.

657
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,886
I'm not saying I won't get a divorce.

658
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,637
I'm just holding off on it for now.

659
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,848
Fine. I get it.

660
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,100
But…

661
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,643
didn't you get anything?

662
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,354
I sent something to your department's

663
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,106
medical office.

664
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,316
What?

665
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,525
What is it now?

666
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,776
More bread?

667
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,489
Something even better.

668
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,943
APPLICATION FOR OWNERSHIP TRANSFER (GIFT)

669
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:26,126
Jeong-suk, you asked to jointly own
the house before,

670
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,671
and I'm sorry I didn't agree to it.

671
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,007
It may be late,
but I'll make things right.

672
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,426
We'll have to pay more taxes

673
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,470
since we've been
married for over ten years,

674
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,515
but for you, I can bear that much.

675
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:45,354
PS, just prepare your seal and ID.

676
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,456
I don't want this.

677
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,833
You'll be taxed heavily.

678
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,334
Save your money.

679
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,963
Are you really going to keep this up?

680
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,133
-Are you really disregarding my sincerity?
-Mr. Seo In-ho.

681
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,343
It's already too late.

682
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,858
I need to borrow some money.

683
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,946
Then what happened to all his assets?

684
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,156
Did she not inherit anything?

685
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,490
I don't know the details,

686
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,242
but her father didn't leave a will,

687
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,453
so she probably split it in half
with her brother.

688
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,080
Half? How much were all the assets worth?

689
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,416
I'm not sure,

690
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,459
but…

691
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,878
wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

692
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,380
Wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

693
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,050
Wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

694
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,468
One hundred billion…

695
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,430
I'll be punished for this.

696
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,724
I can't toss my daughter-in-law out

697
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,643
just to get more money.

698
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,355
Just the sound of 100 billion won.

699
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,023
Gosh, my mind is all out of sorts.

700
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,029
Hello?

701
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,364
Why are you calling me at this hour?

702
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,406
Mother,

703
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,576
do you know my mother-in-law
was admitted to our hospital?

704
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,161
Ms. Oh?

705
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,751
You know how you crave something sweet
when you're in a bad mood, right?

706
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,171
So I bought every kind so
you can do that for every occasion.

707
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,339
I see.

708
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,383
They're too pretty to eat.

709
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,385
Thank you for this.

710
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,387
You look unwell.

711
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,639
Have they still not found the cause?

712
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:48,060
Since I'm at a big hospital,
I consider myself half-fixed already.

713
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,770
Gosh, of course.

714
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,107
My son is making every effort he can.

715
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,568
He was so worried about you
after hearing you were admitted.

716
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,864
He may not express it,
but he has a deep heart.

717
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,324
You know this too, right?

718
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,119
Yes.

719
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,959
What did I do to deserve this?

720
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,878
This is upsetting.

721
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,672
Oh, my.

722
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,259
Look how good he looks.

723
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,138
Gosh, that's my son.

724
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,354
What in the world?

725
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,148
Look who it is.

726
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,192
Hello.

727
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,610
Do you know her?

728
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,071
Yes.

729
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,364
You should head up first, Chief Lim.

730
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,782
-Okay.
-Hello.

731
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,701
Goodbye.

732
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,497
Goodness, I didn't expect to run into you

733
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,666
since this is such a big hospital.

734
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,169
What brings you here?

735
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,045
My in…

736
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,674
Someone I know was admitted.

737
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,135
Have you been well?

738
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,472
I felt terrible after what happened
the last time we met.

739
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,099
I see.

740
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,852
Then please get home safely.

741
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,687
Yes.

742
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,234
Wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

743
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,778
Wouldn't it be around 100 billion won?

744
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,363
One hundred billion--

745
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,531
-Grandma.
-Hey.

746
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,992
What are you looking at?

747
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,203
Nothing.

748
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,288
What brings you here?

749
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,457
I heard Grandma
was admitted to the hospital.

750
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,709
Are you here to see her too?

751
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,753
Yes, I already visited her.

752
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,047
Go and comfort
your grandmother well, okay?

753
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:40,964
Okay.

754
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,301
-Then I'll see you at home later.
-Okay.

755
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,639
They're so nice
to their maternal grandmother.

756
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,308
Gosh, it's all pointless.

757
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:57,981
In-ho.

758
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,317
Yes, I'm at the hospital right now.

759
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:01,944
Do you have a minute?

760
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,238
A PATIENT'S EARNESTNESS CAN OVERCOME LUCK…

761
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,074
She looked so pretty,
sophisticated, and intelligent.

762
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,825
What a shame.

763
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,496
I know you met her by chance,
but why did you act like you knew her?

764
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,331
I wanted a taste of what I couldn't have.

765
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,878
You didn't upset my mother-in-law
and then leave, right?

766
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,590
I even bought expensive cookies
from the department store for her.

767
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,093
You did well.
Please keep up the good work.

768
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,553
Hey, worry about yourself.

769
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,431
When was the last time
you bought her a meal?

770
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,144
Have dinner with her tonight.

771
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,813
Tonight?

772
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,898
Yes, I'll make the reservation.

773
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,025
And give her a lot of spending money too!

774
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,487
Jeong-suk will see right through this.

775
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,697
Is that…

776
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,740
Is that the issue right now?

777
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,577
You're about to lose your wife
and 100 billion won.

778
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,330
-Father.
-Jung-min.

779
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,582
Did you come to see me?

780
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,668
Grandma, that's not it.

781
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,087
Father, did you hear?

782
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,089
Why? Is something wrong?

783
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,341
The professor in charge of Grandma.

784
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,551
-Yes.
-It's…

785
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,468
It's?

786
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,138
Professor Choi Seung-hi.

787
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,610
Dr. Cha, you're here.

788
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,986
You must have been so worried.

789
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,741
You can rest easy now that Professor Choi
will be taking care of your mother.

790
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,951
The chief here says

791
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,913
that it'd be good
if I came to Family Medicine.

792
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:41,501
He even connected me to a talented
and excellent professor here.

793
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,422
It seems we met again.

794
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,424
Please take good care of my daughter.

795
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,469
There's no need for that.
She's already doing well.

796
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,724
You two must be busy.

797
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,059
You should head back to work.

798
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,355
Then please don't worry too much now.

799
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,273
-I hope your treatment goes well.
-Thank you.

800
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:04,941
I'll come again, ma'am.

801
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,568
Yes, thank you.

802
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,540
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO

803
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,090
I know that doctor.

804
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,177
I met with her for my checkup last time.

805
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,972
I ran into her when I came
to this hospital's Orthopedics Department.

806
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:40,143
She seems so nice and kind.

807
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,147
It'd be nice if you were to become
a professor like that.

808
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,985
It's such a relief that you have
a good teacher around you like her.

809
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,613
Your life changes

810
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,284
depending on the people you meet.

811
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,246
Of course.

812
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:00,956
It changes your life.

813
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,501
Completely.

814
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,215
Mom.

815
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,009
There are many other
great professors besides her.

816
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,347
How about changing your doctor
to the chief of my department?

817
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,059
Why change the doctor in charge of me
out of the blue?

818
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,897
Why? Is there an issue with her?

819
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,232
No.

820
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,693
It's not that.

821
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,408
That professor…

822
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,247
was In-ho's girlfriend in college.

823
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,375
What?

824
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,469
Why isn't she picking up?

825
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,224
Though I forgive you,

826
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,851
you should be taught a lesson,

827
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:03,810
don't you think?

828
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,698
My goodness.

829
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,954
Stop laughing, Mom.

830
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,708
Jeez, you're so adorable.

831
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,544
That all happened ages ago.

832
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,630
That's not it.

833
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,757
Do you like In-ho that much?

834
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,343
To be jealous of something like that?

835
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,970
Goodness, you have no pride.

836
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,307
Gosh.

837
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,144
CHOI SEUNG-HI

838
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,858
Assign a different doctor for my mom
no matter what.

839
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:53,985
Why should I do that?

840
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,532
Did you accept my mother
as your patient on purpose?

841
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,243
Think of it what you will.

842
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,913
Are you going to expose your relationship
with In-ho to my mother?

843
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,833
Is that why you're holding her hostage?

844
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,546
Isn't that up to you?

845
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,842
I don't care what you think.

846
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,510
I'm going my own way.

847
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,847
So don't overstep your place, got it?

848
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,032
-Please take care of Jeong-suk.
-Okay, don't worry.

849
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,117
Mom.

850
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,162
-Professor Kim.
-You came right on time.

851
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,789
What in the world?

852
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,793
Why didn't you tell me
your doctor was working here as well?

853
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,628
I know, right?

854
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,338
Why didn't I?

855
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,216
It always bothered me

856
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,554
that I didn't get a chance
to thank him before you got discharged.

857
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,641
It's great that we met again.

858
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,561
Thank you so much, Professor.

859
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,021
Not at all.

860
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,939
I wish you a swift recovery, ma'am.

861
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,733
Thank you.

862
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,159
Mother!

863
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,708
Mother, why are you all the way out here?

864
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,461
-Did you come out for exercise?
-Well,

865
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,754
I felt a bit stuffy.

866
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:40,175
I was just about to come to visit you
in your hospital room.

867
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,469
I wanted to ask you to dinner.

868
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,805
I made a reservation
at a great beef short ribs restaurant.

869
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,974
That sounds good and all,

870
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,936
but I'm worried I'll be
taking up too much of your time.

871
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,979
Not at all, Mother.

872
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,609
Let's all eat together with my mother,
Jung-min, and I-rang later.

873
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,403
The beef at that restaurant is so good.

874
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,699
You're free too, right?

875
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,119
I am.

876
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,374
Gosh, Professor Kim.

877
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,000
You should be on your way.

878
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,252
I should.

879
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,129
Then I'll get going now.

880
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,008
Ma'am, if anything is bothering you,
please call me whenever.

881
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,595
Thank you for saying that, Professor Kim.

882
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:40,151
-What kind of exercise did you do?
-I just walked.

883
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,836
Why did it burn so much?

884
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,921
I cooked it exactly according to the time.

885
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,131
That's why I said I'll--

886
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,091
I can grill it well too.

887
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,468
Mother, I shall cook the meat
for you today.

888
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,388
It's fine. It doesn't matter who cooks it.

889
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,349
What's important is that
we're here as a family.

890
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,893
-Excuse me.
-Grandma, I'll grill it.

891
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,979
-Let me take it, Father.
-Sure.

892
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:16,896
And the scissors.

893
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,443
Ms. Oh, eat up.

894
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,194
The food here is famous.

895
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,116
Mother.

896
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,661
I have been so inattentive
this whole time.

897
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,663
I always used being busy as an excuse.

898
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:37,292
That's why I wasn't able
to catch on until you were this sick.

899
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,961
I have no excuses to give.

900
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,380
Please enjoy this meal.

901
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,175
I promise to be
a better son-in-law from now on.

902
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,597
Thank you for saying that.

903
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:56,227
All I want is for you and Jeong-suk
to live a happy life together.

904
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,063
Yes, we will do that.

905
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,069
That is why I prepared something special

906
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,321
for you today, Mother.

907
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,250
What is that?

908
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,384
CASH CONVEYS FILIAL PIETY BEST
IT MAKES RAISING KIDS WORTHWHILE

909
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,220
What is that?

910
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,519
-Oh, my!
-Oh, my.

911
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,604
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

912
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,690
-Goodness.
-Oh my!

913
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,235
-There's meat here.
-Oh, my!

914
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,569
-Gosh!
-Goodness!

915
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,073
Oh, my!

916
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,324
My goodness!

917
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,034
What in the world?

918
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,912
-Goodness.
-Hey!

919
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,831
-The meat is burning!
-Watch the money.

920
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,762
What is this?

921
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,015
Father, how could you shoot money
like that here?

922
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,271
I just wanted Mother to enjoy it.

923
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,274
You should've done it at home.
This is a public place.

924
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,608
It's okay, Ms. Kwak.

925
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,110
In-ho.

926
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,778
I'm touched by this.

927
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,156
I've never been
showered with money before.

928
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,198
Thank you so much.

929
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,743
I'm so relieved you liked it.

930
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,538
But let's quickly pick up the money first.

931
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,498
Yes, I'll pick them up.

932
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,126
-Take all this too.
-Okay.

933
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,299
It's going to take ages
to get all of them.

934
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,639
It's so good.

935
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,102
Here.

936
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,687
-Please enjoy.
-Okay.

937
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,109
It's delicious.

938
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,444
-Right?
-Eat up.

939
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,532
Professor.

940
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:18,953
Ms. Kwak.

941
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,955
What are you doing here?

942
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,875
Didn't you say you were going to Geoje
to visit your hometown?

943
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,214
And who is this?

944
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,222
I feel like I'm getting a déjà vu.

945
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,766
It's another situation

946
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,894
where everyone knows the secret
except for one person.

947
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:47,106
I know, it was like this
at Mom's birthday dinner too.

948
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,983
I have a bad feeling about this.

949
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,783
-Let go!
-I'm glad I met you!

950
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,409
Hey, you tramp!

951
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,496
How dare you try to seduce my man?

952
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,413
-Mother!
-No!

953
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,249
-There must have been a misunderstanding!
-Mother!

954
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,502
-You must be mistaken!
-Mother!

955
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,796
Please let go of her!
Let go first, and we can talk.

956
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,839
Ma'am, let go of her hand first.

957
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,258
-Are you okay?
-What do we do?

958
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,551
Mother?

959
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,843
Look at this.

960
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,305
So you're the son who had an affair
and raised a secret love child?

961
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,307
Be quiet!

962
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,184
No, Ms. Oh. It's not what you think!

963
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,102
Please cover your ears!

964
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,355
Like mother like son,
both of you are cheaters!

965
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,190
Is it in your genes?

966
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,984
-Let go.
-Please be quiet!

967
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,116
Ma'am, what did you just say?

968
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:43,288
Did you just say he had an affair
and has a secret love child?

969
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,706
Yes!

970
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,500
He had an affair with his first love
and has a daughter.

971
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,918
Did you not know?

972
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,444
Welcome.

973
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,056
DOCTOR CHA

974
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,287
Is it the professor in charge of me?

975
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,497
Professor Choi Seung-hi?

976
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,417
What have you been doing this whole time?
You should have won her back by now!

977
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,503
Once you let go of Seo In-ho,
you can reel in Roy Kim.

978
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,963
Can you come with me?

979
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,757
Is it because of that punk?

980
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,718
I don't want to use anything else
as an excuse to delay this.

981
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,011
You can take this to court.

982
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:26,307
I'm going to stop the divorce,
even if I have to spend my entire fortune.

983
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:32,897
