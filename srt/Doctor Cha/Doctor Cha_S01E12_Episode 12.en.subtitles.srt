1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,805
Doesn't love change?

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,223
It did so for you.

4
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,685
So?

5
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,146
Is that why you're hanging around my wife?

6
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,274
So what if I am?

7
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,692
What?

8
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,904
Would you look at this ******** scumbag?

9
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,739
Hey!

10
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,949
Don't curse at me!

11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,327
I called you
what you deserve to be called!

12
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,580
Hey, what are you two doing?

13
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,248
We should be the ones fighting, not you!

14
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,958
You bastard!

15
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,836
What are you doing?
This is a hospital, you two!

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,088
Why are you being like this?

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,883
Don't bite him like a coward!

18
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,968
You'll get hurt.

19
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,178
-Your nose is bleeding!
-Your nose is bleeding!

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,018
Aren't you guys doctors at this hospital?

21
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,687
That's dangerous. Don't do it!

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,191
Professor Seo.

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,195
-This is a hospital!
-Wait.

24
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,155
-You two must be crazy!
-Come on!

25
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,950
Can't you see you're in a hospital?

26
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,830
-This is all your fault.
-Do you want to get hit?

27
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,707
-Let go.
-Do you want to get hit?

28
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,667
-I'll hit you twice.
-Three times.

29
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,710
-Do you want to be hit four times?
-This is all your fault.

30
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,087
This is all your fault!

31
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,880
Let go of my hair!

32
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,174
All of you, stop!

33
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,891
My back.

34
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,815
We were fighting because of Bong-suk,
but why were you two…

35
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,163
Have you two lost it?

36
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,248
Is this how you should act in a hospital?

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,460
What's with you? I thought you were
all about maintaining your image.

38
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,171
Have you completely lost your mind?

39
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,423
Dr. Kim, you too.

40
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,759
There are already rumors
about how we're in a love triangle.

41
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,388
Are you trying to give people more things
to gossip about?

42
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,099
How could the two of you
be so thoughtless and immature?

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,519
How could you lose control
of your emotions and let this happen?

44
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,731
Dr. Cha, I'm sorry.
I have no excuses to give.

45
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,569
We'll just say that we fought
because we don't get along.

46
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,905
-Are you serious? You're the one who--
-Enough!

47
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,661
But why are you sleeping
in someone else's house?

48
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,579
You should be embarrassed.

49
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,874
Why should I be embarrassed? For what?

50
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,958
There are others too.

51
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,002
Dr. Jeon and Chief Resident Hwang
are there too.

52
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,630
I guess you only see indecent things.

53
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,465
What on earth are you imagining?

54
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,800
Thanks for bringing it up.
What do you think?

55
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,011
Put yourself in my shoes.

56
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,056
That isn't possible. I never cheated
on anyone in the first place.

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,975
And I don't have a secret love child.

58
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,394
Come here, you *******! Damn it!

59
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,480
For goodness' sake!

60
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,523
You dodged my blow? You little…

61
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,527
Jeez.

62
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,112
Gosh.

63
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,657
Calm down.

64
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,867
It hurts.

65
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,082
Come on, why are you pushing
yourself like this?

66
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,917
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

67
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,928
The baby is being discharged tomorrow.

68
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,972
Really? That's great.

69
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,308
-Did you think of a name yet?
-Li-ji.

70
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,226
"Li-ji"?

71
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,560
Short for "Little Ji-seon."

72
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,897
I heard it's a trend to use
English-sounding names.

73
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,695
-The baby is pretty, right?
-Yes, she's so pretty.

74
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,783
She already looks at me,
and sometimes she even smiles.

75
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,537
But I heard that's not a real smile,
just some kind of reflex.

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:48,955
She's so cute.

77
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,625
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

78
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,504
Yes. My stomach keeps hurting.

79
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,384
-Maybe it's time for me to die.
-Don't say things like that.

80
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,303
Go to the ER, okay?

81
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,180
Can't you just take a look?

82
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,349
Well, that wouldn't be right.

83
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,103
Then go to the Family Medicine Department
and get examined there, okay?

84
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,106
Which professor is doing
outpatient appointments today again?

85
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,406
-Does your stomach hurt a lot?
-It's better than before.

86
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,326
It hasn't been long
since you've given birth,

87
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,203
so even a small symptom
can progress to a serious illness.

88
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,580
I see.

89
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,960
And I am worried since you have
an issue with your colon as well.

90
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,755
I think it might be
an intestinal obstruction.

91
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,508
I think you should be admitted
and monitored.

92
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,761
Admitted?

93
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,738
Don't be so obvious.

94
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,282
Finish your job before you collapse.

95
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,419
Seo Jung-min speaking.

96
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
Yes, I'll go there right away.

97
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,477
Are you okay?

98
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,694
My baby is being discharged tomorrow.
We have to go home together.

99
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,656
Then you should have said
that you didn't want to be admitted.

100
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,744
The doctor said she should be admitted,
and she agreed to it on impulse.

101
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,831
Doctor, please let me be discharged.

102
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,250
Our professor requested a consultation
with the Surgery Department.

103
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,586
We'll hear what the doctor there
has to say before discharging you.

104
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:02,880
He's here.

105
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,299
Dr. Seo, you came?

106
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,300
Hello.

107
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,515
Yes, it is that patient.

108
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,227
She came to Family Medicine
due to abdominal pain.

109
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,770
She has symptoms of nausea and vomiting.

110
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,189
It's not severe,
and she has bowel movements.

111
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,149
Rebound?

112
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,526
It's kind of borderline.

113
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,403
It doesn't seem like appendicitis

114
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,321
or a symptom related to the colon.

115
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,866
And I suspect
there might be a little ileus.

116
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,784
Okay.

117
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,371
Then I'll give her that explanation
and discharge her.

118
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,168
There's a condition called acute abdomen.

119
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,838
It occurs when the stomach or intestines
rupture and peritonitis occurs.

120
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,884
Your symptoms right now aren't
exactly acute abdomen symptoms,

121
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,094
but we can't rule out
the possibility either.

122
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,181
The professor wants you
to be admitted if possible,

123
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,642
or at the very least take
a CT scan to check things.

124
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,395
There's a possibility
your abdominal symptoms will worsen

125
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,731
if you leave the hospital.

126
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,775
If peritonitis or perforation
in your stomach or intestines occurs,

127
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,903
then it might be difficult
to perform surgery.

128
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,201
But if you insist on going home,
you should skip a few meals.

129
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,286
If your condition improves,
you can have food that's easy to digest.

130
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,914
And always keep your stomach warm.

131
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,248
Okay, I'll do that.

132
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,919
It's natural that a cancer patient
feels pain sometimes.

133
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,463
-Bye.
-But, Dr. Seo,

134
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:26,923
are you sick?

135
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,217
You look sicker than I do.

136
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,096
I'm fine.

137
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,474
Dr. Seo, do you want to see
a picture of my baby?

138
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,482
She's adorable.

139
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,361
MOCK EXAM RESULTS

140
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,946
I took all my stuff from the art academy.

141
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,906
Get a refund on the fees for this month.

142
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,745
The rounds are done, right?
You all can go.

143
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,622
Dr. Cha, can I have a word?

144
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,046
When will you decide?

145
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,466
-What?
-You need to decide

146
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,970
whether you'll get a divorce or not
so I can plan my next move.

147
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,432
-You must have lost your mind.
-No, I'm completely fine.

148
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,517
My feelings are clearer
now than ever before.

149
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,894
I hate seeing you.

150
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,772
It's annoying
to see you at the hospital every day,

151
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,274
to the point of driving me crazy.

152
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,650
So hurry up and leave.

153
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,651
Choi Seung-hi.

154
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,528
Are you really
the impressive woman I used to know?

155
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,490
I'm disappointed
because I thought you'd be different.

156
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,743
Were you always this low and vulgar?

157
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,078
I'm doing this to avoid
being low and vulgar.

158
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,705
Ever since you began working here,

159
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,875
I had to live in silence like a sinner
whenever I saw you.

160
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,878
But I won't live like that anymore

161
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,881
and I won't stand my daughter
being treated like some sinner too.

162
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,593
You've got to be kidding me.

163
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,971
So this is how you act
despite being aware that you are a sinner?

164
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,806
Sure, thanks for bringing this up.

165
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,727
During college, when I got pregnant
and married In-ho,

166
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,520
you…

167
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,231
looked at me with such loathing
until we graduated.

168
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,319
You disregarded me and looked at me
with such disdain that it was humiliating.

169
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,739
You didn't allow me to forget
my wrongdoing until we graduated.

170
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,535
But you find it unfair that you were
treated like a sinner for a few months?

171
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,538
Are you that angry that your daughter
has to start college a year late?

172
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,167
This doesn't make things fair.

173
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,756
Sure, if you don't want to quit,
keep working here.

174
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,757
But in return,

175
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,176
while I'm receiving my training,

176
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,221
you'll have a constant reminder
of what you've done

177
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,722
every time you look at my face.

178
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,398
Then can I take back what's mine?

179
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,483
The happy family you maintained
for over 20 years,

180
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,528
the very thing you stole from me?

181
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,697
You lunatic.

182
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,991
Watch what you say. I'm your advisor.

183
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,494
-Know your place.
-How unfortunate.

184
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,330
That's all you can say to me now, right?

185
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:47,915
Right?

186
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,837
Is your goal to torture me?
Or is it Seo In-ho?

187
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,047
I don't have to explain anything to you.

188
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,509
Stop dragging this out and decide.

189
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,387
I already said this,
but I'm not quitting this hospital.

190
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,264
So if anything, you quit.

191
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,016
Or expose everything
and see what will happen afterward!

192
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,573
Aren't you even curious about Eun-seo?

193
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,075
She'll probably fail
to go to college this year!

194
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,786
She can't draw and she quit her academy.

195
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,622
And they don't know how long
it'll take for her to recover!

196
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,126
Say something!

197
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,628
Is that why you went to Jeong-suk?

198
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,839
Yes, and I'm not quitting this hospital.

199
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,050
If she can't take it,
she should leave instead of me.

200
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,095
I'm not backing down anymore.
I'm getting back what was mine.

201
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,098
Why? Can I not?

202
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,933
Can't I just have a regular family?

203
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,935
Does Eun-seo have to live
without a father forever?

204
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,985
Seung-hi, I don't know if this is right.

205
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,904
Looking at how things turned out,

206
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,198
we could be fated for each other.

207
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,908
Let's talk after work.

208
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,288
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

209
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,708
Excuse me, please show me
Yoo Ji-seon's CT scan.

210
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,301
Gosh.

211
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,556
This is a report
about a patient in the ER.

212
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,185
She is a 21-year-old woman
with whole abdomen DT and RT.

213
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,104
Her WBC is up to 18,000,
her hemoglobin is up to 8.5,

214
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,190
and her CRP is up to 56
according to her labs.

215
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,567
And free air has been observed
in her chest PA.

216
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,194
The CT scan shows
perforation of a gastric ulcer

217
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,197
and a lot of fluid buildup in
her peritoneum and bowel material soiling.

218
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,449
Shouldn't you report this to
the Gastrointestinal Surgery Department?

219
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,911
Most of the professors are at a conference
and thus out of office.

220
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,996
And the ones remaining
are in the middle of surgeries.

221
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,706
You're the professor on duty today,

222
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,375
I came to you because it was so urgent.

223
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,627
Her vitals?

224
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,671
Her BP is 90 over 50,
and heart rate is 105.

225
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,005
Her fever is at 38.1°.

226
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,300
-Is a vasopressor agent being used?
-Yes, a central line was inserted

227
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,969
to administer a low dosage of dopamine.

228
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,638
And she's been given 500cc of fluid.

229
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,431
What's the patient's name?

230
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,559
Yoo Ji-seon.

231
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,563
Get an anesthesiologist, secure an OR,
and get a consent form.

232
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,148
Warn the guardians about the situation.

233
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,483
I'll go straight to the OR.

234
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,442
Okay, thank you.

235
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,247
Jeez, the smell.

236
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,957
It was like this
for longer than I thought.

237
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,091
The lesions are too severe for an ulcer.

238
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,094
Isn't this perforated cancer?

239
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,597
I can feel small nodules
on her abdominal wall.

240
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,891
I think it's peritoneal seeding.

241
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,643
Isn't this a patient with colon cancer
that metastasized to the liver?

242
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,562
Has it metastasized to the stomach?

243
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,397
Rather than metastasis to the stomach,

244
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,941
it's a gastric cancer perforation
with peritoneal seeding.

245
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,943
Then it is a double primary cancer?

246
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,154
We'll need to do a biopsy to be sure.

247
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,966
The situation is really bad,
but let's give it a shot.

248
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,885
Prepare a lot of warm saline irrigation.

249
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,596
Contact the Pathology Department
for a biopsy.

250
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,972
Okay.

251
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,156
Have you eaten?

252
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,950
Like you even care.

253
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,915
Choi Seung-hi said
I should quit and divorce you.

254
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,087
She seemed to want
to settle down with you.

255
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,005
Do you feel the same?

256
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,966
Would you two be happy if I bow out?

257
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,301
What are you on about?
I have no intention of doing that.

258
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,469
I don't care.

259
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,013
I don't care
if you two settle down or not.

260
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,306
Just don't get on my nerves.

261
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,601
Don't drive me crazier than I already am.

262
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,353
Give me some time.

263
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,563
I'll end things.

264
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,070
Seung-hi, I have something to say.

265
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,990
Say it. Just don't say
that we should break up.

266
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,660
If you say that, I'm going to kill you.

267
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,708
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,252
I really have no words.

269
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,295
Shut up.

270
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,297
I'll do my best for Eun-seo.

271
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,967
But I need to go back…

272
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,845
to where I belong.

273
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,890
My life went off track
because of my own mistakes,

274
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,393
but I think it's time to set things right.

275
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,896
I don't think I'll get another chance.

276
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,901
I know this is cruel to you,
and I'm so sorry.

277
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,530
But this could be the best for you too.

278
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,574
Think of it like that.

279
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,700
You're…

280
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,244
abandoning me again?

281
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,873
You can live a better life without me.

282
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,376
You're the only one
who doesn't see that like a fool.

283
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,420
Why are you deciding that for me?

284
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,006
Do you know
how lonely I was this whole time?

285
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,551
Do you really not know how much Eun-seo

286
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,386
needs a father?

287
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,599
Even if you go back,

288
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,435
you won't be treated like you were before.

289
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,063
They'll be hard on you
until the day you die.

290
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,856
I know.

291
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,150
But you are still going back?

292
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,195
Do you love your wife?

293
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,738
I…

294
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,491
rely on her a lot.

295
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,494
When I think about it,

296
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,955
I depended on her a lot
when we had the kids

297
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,458
at such a young age

298
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,753
and when my father was sick.

299
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,589
So I want to spend the rest of my life

300
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,050
asking for her forgiveness.

301
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,639
So now you're saying
you've depended on your wife?

302
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,266
Ask for forgiveness?

303
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,603
If you had any conscience,
you wouldn't say that.

304
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,773
You don't have a right
to be saying those things.

305
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,152
If things end between us,
I'll be the one to end them.

306
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,279
If you say something like this again,

307
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,574
it'll be me who exposes everything,
not your wife.

308
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,576
-Do you understand?
-Seung-hi.

309
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,746
Don't be so obstinate.

310
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,041
You horrible bastard.

311
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,544
You cowardly jerk.

312
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,004
You piece of trash.

313
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,440
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.

314
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,379
What is it?

315
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,431
Tell me in detail.

316
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,735
Are you here for Jung-min?

317
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,029
He's not at work
and he's not answering his phone.

318
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,699
I came here thinking he might be home.

319
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,703
-What about Mother?
-She's not here.

320
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,997
I-rang isn't back from her academy.

321
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,500
How weak of him.

322
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,503
How dare he try to hide
instead of fixing this mess?

323
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,963
This isn't the time to be saying that.

324
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm just upset, that's all!

325
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,352
Yes, hello.

326
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,521
Hello, ma'am.

327
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,024
Did you know that
I-rang's mock exam grades have come out?

328
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:16,942
Yes.

329
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,821
But I haven't been able to check them yet.

330
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,325
Her national rank fell
by a lot this time around.

331
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,828
And I-rang is feeling very discouraged.

332
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,622
And on top of that…

333
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,250
Yes.

334
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,837
Yes, of course.

335
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
Yes, okay.

336
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,804
Thank you.

337
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,185
Was that I-rang's homeroom teacher?

338
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,062
What did she say?

339
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,273
Her mock exam grades fell by a lot.

340
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,278
See, I knew this would happen!

341
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,698
She slacked off
now that she's pursuing art.

342
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,784
I told you she shouldn't slack off
even if she changes her academic path!

343
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,494
Whose fault is this?

344
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,333
I-rang doesn't talk at school lately.

345
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,461
The teacher asked me
if something is going on at home.

346
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,797
Do you not understand
what caused all this?

347
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,264
There's no time for this. Get changed.

348
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,725
We have to go somewhere.

349
00:22:56,374 --> 00:23:00,253
I am so deeply sorry for your loss.

350
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,931
The doctor who neglected my daughter
is your son, is he not?

351
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:16,353
How come you two are here
instead of your son who killed my child?

352
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:22,359
You thought you could leave her to die
just because she was terminally ill?

353
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,070
This is medical malpractice!

354
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,156
I'm going to sue all of you!

355
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,576
I'm going to sue you
and see that you all go to jail!

356
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,287
Enough, stop it.

357
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,206
Ji-seon can hear you.

358
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm saying it so she does hear me!

359
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:44,422
How can you discharge a sick patient
without saying a word to her guardian?

360
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,758
This is clearly medical malpractice.
Take responsibility!

361
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,220
Gosh, I feel so bad for our Ji-seon.
What do we do?

362
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,097
How shameless of you to come!

363
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,558
Bring that doctor here right now!

364
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,395
Gosh, our poor Ji-seon.

365
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,940
How will you take responsibility
for what happened to Ji-seon?

366
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,150
How?

367
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,319
Don't just sit there, say something!

368
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,073
-What do we do for our poor Ji-seon?
-Darn it.

369
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,258
SEO JUNG-MIN

370
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,012
-Dr. Jeon.
-Yes?

371
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,265
The patient Hong Seo-hui wants to see you
because her pain is severe.

372
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,100
Okay, I'll go there now.

373
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,978
Dr. Jeon, I saw Dr. Seo Jung-min earlier.

374
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,230
Where?

375
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,673
Family Medicine requested

376
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,885
a consultation with our department
regarding that patient, right?

377
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,886
When was that?

378
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,972
The day she was discharged.

379
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,891
Who was the doctor in charge?

380
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,644
A third-year named Park Ji-yeon.
She's our chief resident.

381
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,105
-Why?
-I'm just checking the facts.

382
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,316
We need to check
who should be held accountable.

383
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,195
Your department might've
misdiagnosed her in the first place.

384
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,074
Did you see the chart?

385
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,533
I did.

386
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,454
We asked General Surgery to take a look
before discharging her.

387
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,874
And Jung-min came
and said she could be discharged.

388
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,046
I know this hurts,
but Jung-min is at fault here.

389
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,007
At the very least,
tests should have been run.

390
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,511
So why are you talking
about accountability?

391
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,348
Still, we need to make it so that
this was a mistake by your department.

392
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,560
So that the worst won't happen
to Jung-min.

393
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,148
Choi Seung-hi was in charge.

394
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,485
If you keep making an issue of this,

395
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,654
Seung-hi might become
embroiled in this too.

396
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,740
I broke up with Seung-hi.

397
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,701
As if.

398
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,080
To be exact,
we're in the middle of breaking up.

399
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,542
I'll resolve Jung-min's predicament,
so don't worry.

400
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,544
And if you do break up?

401
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,713
That makes it okay to do this to her?

402
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,507
This is for my son.

403
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,719
This is hilarious.

404
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,014
Why do I suddenly feel bad for Seung-hi?

405
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,559
I can't just sit back and watch
Jung-min hit rock bottom.

406
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,852
So don't say anything.

407
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,240
They found Jung-min.

408
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,287
I'll take care of I-rang.

409
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,082
You go meet with Jung-min
and make him come to his senses.

410
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,584
Right now, Jung-min needs you

411
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,836
more than he needs me.

412
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,590
What about us?

413
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,676
What's going to happen to us?

414
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,306
Jeong-suk.

415
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,017
Can't you forgive me?

416
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,922
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

417
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,595
THE LATE YOO JI-SEON

418
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:43,972
Before…

419
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,600
I started my residency,

420
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,146
I almost died from acute liver failure.

421
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,109
I was so bitter about almost dying,

422
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,570
so I can't even imagine
the pain you are in…

423
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,366
after losing your own child.

424
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,952
I think

425
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,956
I might know why Ji-seon
wanted to give birth to her baby…

426
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,001
so badly.

427
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,838
So her mom and dad wouldn't be lonely.

428
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,674
So they wouldn't give up on life.

429
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,219
It was her own method

430
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,680
of providing her parents a way

431
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,558
to continue to live through her child.

432
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,608
Ji-seon…

433
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,195
always seemed like she knew that

434
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,948
she was going to leave like this one day.

435
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,162
So please understand her wishes.

436
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:56,461
Live happily with the angel
your daughter left behind.

437
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,546
And…

438
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,467
later on,

439
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,053
you'll meet her again.

440
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,353
Why…

441
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,649
aren't you asking me to forgive your son?

442
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,655
I don't have the right to ask you that.

443
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,888
ACCESSIBLE PARKING

444
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,374
DRIVER WITH DISABILITY

445
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,917
Did you apply
for your disability rating yet?

446
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,502
Disability rating?

447
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,050
But what's the point?
There aren't many benefits.

448
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,053
What are you talking about?
With parking so difficult these days,

449
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,014
it's great to park
in a disabled parking space.

450
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,515
The spot is great too.

451
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,160
Jeong-suk can't come today.

452
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,203
I know.

453
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:59,417
You know, and yet you keep looking around
thinking she might show up.

454
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,335
What?

455
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,466
-Well…
-If you don't have plans today,

456
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,551
how about an afternoon drink
after the run?

457
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,143
This is about the time
when our true selves need to come out.

458
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:21,064
I'm all about give and take.

459
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:25,443
With that in mind, I'll tell you a secret.

460
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,112
But can I ask you something in return?

461
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,406
Okay.

462
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,658
You're good-looking.

463
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,455
I've actually run a full marathon.

464
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,500
I finished nine of them.
You didn't know, right?

465
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,086
You probably had no idea.

466
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,171
I acted my heart out
if I do say so myself.

467
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,550
Okay, your turn.

468
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,095
Do you like Jeong-suk?

469
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,396
But I already knew
you completed a full marathon.

470
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,067
Your posture
and breathing were too stable.

471
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,320
Darn it.

472
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,990
Then I'll tell you a different secret.

473
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,828
I joined this crew
because I was interested in you.

474
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,624
But now, it's totally not like that.

475
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,377
Now you're just a fellow crew member.

476
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,132
Okay, now it's your turn to talk.

477
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,676
About Jeong-suk.

478
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,179
I…

479
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,897
I flunked the mock exam.

480
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,691
I heard.

481
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,235
I really wanted to show Dad.

482
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,490
That I chose art school
not because I couldn't go to med school.

483
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,993
I wanted to prove that.

484
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,995
I'm so annoyed.

485
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:04,083
You should be studying for yourself.

486
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,793
Not to rebel against someone.

487
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,671
Mom.

488
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,965
That was so cliché.

489
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:13,968
No way.

490
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,640
I'd rather have you yell at me
for failing the exam.

491
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:24,020
How can I yell at you guys
after giving you all that stress?

492
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,941
Resolving these situations

493
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,860
won't be easy.

494
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,448
But I'll resolve it
in the most peaceful way possible.

495
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:41,245
So that you two and I will suffer
the least amount of damage possible.

496
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,959
I saw it on TV,

497
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,128
but you raised me way too freely.

498
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,175
Are you criticizing me by saying
the way I raised you was wrong?

499
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,887
Look at you.

500
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:02,850
You're really not holding back
now that you're all grown-up, are you?

501
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,977
Thankfully, Dad was the complete opposite,

502
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,188
so I ended up being
only moderately spoiled.

503
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,399
If not, I might've become
a complete delinquent.

504
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,151
A delinquent?

505
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,238
Jeez.

506
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,747
I…

507
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,628
wanted my kids
to be a little immature as they grew up.

508
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,049
I would always be there
when you came home,

509
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,846
and if you wanted something,
you'd badger me for it.

510
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,724
I never got a chance to be like that.

511
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:51,440
So simply put, the way I raised you
was totally intentional.

512
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,360
Then you achieved your goal.

513
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:58,322
Of course. Look, I raised you freely,

514
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,199
and that helped you find your own path.

515
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,493
That is true.

516
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,540
But I still don't understand.

517
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,919
I wonder who you take after
to draw so well?

518
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:20,344
This patient was admitted to our hospital
for colon cancer surgery.

519
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,266
The primary cause
we're looking at is old age.

520
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,896
And based on our investigation,
given the patient's old age,

521
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,357
the eating habits
that had continued until now

522
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,735
were extremely lacking in dietary fiber.

523
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,279
The patient also consumed a lot of foods

524
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,824
that were high in fat as well as a lot
of refined and processed foods.

525
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,826
So we are looking at that as the cause.

526
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,211
-Where on earth--
-Don't say that!

527
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,631
I'm not saying you should coddle him.

528
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,966
Just don't trample all over him.

529
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,098
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,731
When I was on night duty in the ER
as a first-year,

531
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,485
three patients from a car crash
came in at the same time.

532
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,365
All of their vitals were unstable,
and they were all gushing out blood.

533
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,870
It was an extremely critical situation,
but we didn't have many doctors.

534
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,333
I thought I would have to declare
all of them dead at that rate.

535
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,878
But thankfully two of them
received surgery in time and survived.

536
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,172
What about the other one?

537
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,591
There were only two options in my head.

538
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,720
One was to wait for a professor
who could perform surgery.

539
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,222
The other was to transfer them.

540
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,642
I decided to transfer them
to a different hospital.

541
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,937
But during the transfer,

542
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,732
the patient went into cardiac arrest
and was pronounced DOA.

543
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,406
If I had waited, wouldn't the patient
have received surgery?

544
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,700
Then wouldn't the patient have lived?

545
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,910
Those were some of the thoughts I had.

546
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,288
That's when I realized.

547
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,540
That a doctor's judgment

548
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,710
determines whether a patient
will live or die.

549
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,006
Jung-min.

550
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:25,594
The fact is that the patient died.
There's no denying that.

551
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,471
Yes.

552
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,517
If you want to be a good doctor,
you can't avoid this situation.

553
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,060
If you want to protest, then do so.

554
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,271
If you made a mistake,
admit it and ask for forgiveness.

555
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,649
Don't forget your mistake
and learn from it.

556
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,485
So that you can make the right judgments.

557
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,864
So that you can help even more people.

558
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,493
That's how we all become doctors.

559
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,829
Okay.

560
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,499
I don't know
if you'll agree with me on this,

561
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,710
but you definitely…

562
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,548
have sides to you that are better than me.

563
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,265
Are you okay?

564
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,267
No.

565
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,061
If I could,

566
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,522
I want to just disappear.

567
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,357
As you already know,

568
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,276
I'm not great with words.

569
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,903
And…

570
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,242
there are no words right now
that will make you feel better.

571
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,912
But I can promise you this.

572
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,416
Until you find a way
to get back on your feet,

573
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,294
I'll stay by your side

574
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,424
if you allow me to.

575
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,833
Her family is threatening to sue.

576
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,918
The hospital will respond accordingly,

577
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,421
but since Jung-min was the one
who discharged her,

578
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,256
the family is finding fault with that.

579
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,093
Jung-min needs to try to make an effort
to come to an agreement.

580
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,722
It may seem unfair in your position,
but what can be done?

581
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,893
It'd be best to settle things
before this situation grows any bigger.

582
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,062
I fully understand what you are saying.

583
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:27,109
But I still think this situation needs
to be looked into more carefully.

584
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,696
Professor Seo In-ho

585
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,824
is trying to pin this medical accident
on our department.

586
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,368
Since this involves his son,

587
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,955
he's dead set on making sure
our department takes the fall for it.

588
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,668
Jeez, you didn't know?

589
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,545
Professor Seo?

590
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,923
He's brazenly trying
to force a lie on everyone.

591
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,508
That patient

592
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,885
was your patient, Professor Choi.

593
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,928
Defend yourself.

594
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,764
Otherwise, you might end up
on the chopping block.

595
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,399
Professor Kim.

596
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,529
Can't eat, right?

597
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,115
I guess not.

598
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,410
You were due for a checkup, you know.

599
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,328
Right.

600
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,206
I had some medication left, so I forgot.

601
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,583
-I should go.
-You have some left,

602
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,835
which means you forgot to take them.

603
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,754
That's not true.

604
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,674
The one thing I do for sure
is take my medication regularly.

605
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,219
Are you going to keep lying?

606
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,058
Actually, I forgot a couple of times
and didn't take them.

607
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,562
You're not eating
or taking your medication.

608
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,691
This won't do.
I'll wait until you finish your meal.

609
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,402
There's no need for that, Professor.

610
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,112
Dr. Cha.

611
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,491
Take just half of the energy you use
on others and use it for yourself.

612
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,953
If you continue to neglect
taking care of yourself,

613
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,705
something really bad may happen.

614
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,084
I have the right to nag you.

615
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,714
Of course. I'll take my medication
regularly starting now.

616
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,549
And I'll eat well too.

617
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,509
Thank you for worrying about me.

618
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,939
Professor Seo.

619
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,155
I heard you were blaming our department
for the cancer patient.

620
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,201
The patient was admitted
and discharged by Family Medicine,

621
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,704
so you should take responsibility
if something occurs.

622
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,623
How is that
our department's responsibility?

623
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,416
We requested a consultation,

624
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,669
and your department took one look
and discharged her right away.

625
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,131
We did?

626
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,258
Hey, Seo In-ho!

627
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,721
I know that your resident
called my resident

628
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,599
confirming that you gave the okay
for the patient's discharge.

629
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,434
Do you really not know that?

630
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,604
She was discharged
before the official answer was closed.

631
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,940
Even if that was the case,
the official decision to discharge

632
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,567
is made by the department
that admitted her.

633
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,236
Technically, isn't she a patient
from your department?

634
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,782
That's why we asked for a consultation,
so your resident looked into her,

635
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,076
and you even gave the okay too.

636
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,535
If the surgery department says so,

637
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,871
there's no reason for us
not to discharge her.

638
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,916
My resident seems
to have made some mistakes.

639
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,210
In that regard, I'll give him a warning.

640
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,838
Giving him a warning
won't solve the issue here, will it?

641
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,964
I'm not sure.

642
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,175
If the records were left in detail,

643
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,636
and he carried out
all the necessary duties,

644
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,263
then that means the patient
neglected his warning and went home.

645
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,309
Regarding the peritonitis, we actively
and aggressively performed surgery,

646
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,769
but it did not go well.

647
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,979
So it's hard to say
it's the hospital's fault.

648
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:56,151
Regardless, the fact that my department
is involved in this incident offends me.

649
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,487
Of course, Family Medicine is involved.

650
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:03,534
Medical accidents can occur regardless
of someone's intention or wrongdoing.

651
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:07,079
But someone always
has to be held accountable.

652
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,165
So we need to officially decide
who is responsible.

653
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,709
If my department suffers because of this--

654
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,921
If the patient was admitted
after seeing Family Medicine--

655
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,423
Regardless,

656
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,091
please take back what you said

657
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,802
about how Family Medicine
should be held responsible.

658
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,764
-What?
-I'll take it that you'll do as I asked.

659
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,835
You came again.

660
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:56,753
Actually,

661
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,257
I came because
I have something to tell you both.

662
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,136
The resident who discharged her
came before too.

663
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,762
He left after crying on his knees.

664
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,349
But doing that won't bring our child back.

665
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,729
I want to explain to you
why your daughter died.

666
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,731
I don't want to hear it, so please leave.

667
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,498
Why are you here at this hour
out of the blue?

668
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,832
Is something wrong?

669
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,375
What could be wrong?

670
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,879
I just came to sleep over.

671
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,423
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

672
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,842
I'm telling you, nothing's wrong.

673
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,930
I came here after the group dinner
because I missed you so much.

674
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,731
MS. OH DEOK-RYE

675
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,069
Yes, Ms. Oh.

676
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,570
It's been a while.

677
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,281
To what do I owe this pleasure?

678
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,367
I just called to see how things are.

679
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,620
I was using the cosmetics you gave me,

680
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,414
and I wondered if you were well,

681
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,834
and how you feel after your surgery.

682
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,128
I see.

683
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:25,717
Gosh, thanks to you, I'm doing so well.

684
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,972
There's nothing wrong with In-ho
or Jeong-suk, right?

685
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,350
In truth, Jeong-suk

686
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,770
looked so down the last time I saw her
that it's been bothering me.

687
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,565
Gosh.

688
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,484
The work at the hospital is hard.

689
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,152
Right.

690
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:49,241
As a matter of fact, there was a place
I wanted to go with you.

691
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,159
Do you have time today?

692
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,619
Today?

693
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,920
This is a very famous
Korean medical clinic.

694
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,423
After taking the medicine I got here,

695
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,592
I regained my strength.

696
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,178
Ms. Oh Deok-rye.

697
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,806
-Yes.
-Yes.

698
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,483
PROFESSOR PARK HO-WON
I RECEIVED YOUR INVESTMENT

699
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,860
MAY THERE BE A PROSPEROUS FUTURE FOR US

700
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,071
Your pulse is irregular.

701
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,533
Your blood density as it flows
into your blood vessels is low,

702
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,327
and it doesn't flow smoothly either.

703
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,371
In particular, the pulse tied
to your liver and stomach functions

704
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,373
have declined a lot.

705
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,792
You have inflammation
inside your body as well.

706
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,128
Am I that unwell?

707
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,672
You're lucky to be alive and moving.

708
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:50,594
You probably haven't been able to sleep
and have a hard time eating.

709
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,639
Medicine is one thing,
but you should begin treatment right away.

710
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,021
VERITY KOREAN MEDICAL CLINIC

711
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,357
That doctor is supposed
to be really talented.

712
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,275
How strange.

713
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,236
Don't be concerned.

714
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,988
It's just because I'm old.

715
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:14,493
I'll buy you a delicious dinner too.
What would you like to eat?

716
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,080
-You want to have dinner?
-Yes.

717
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,456
Ms. Kwak.

718
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,625
Do you not know what today is?

719
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,418
What day is it today?

720
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,796
It's not my birthday…

721
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,339
What could it be?

722
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,925
Do you have redder apples?

723
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,469
Of course. Are you preparing
for a memorial service?

724
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,387
Yes.

725
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,639
Who is it for?

726
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,974
My father-in-law.

727
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,518
Goodness, in this day and age?

728
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,646
You're a daughter-in-law
that's one in a million.

729
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,648
Thank you.

730
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,959
-Did you tell her to come?
-No.

731
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,627
I'm not that shameless.

732
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,130
How can I ask her to prepare
for my father's memorial service?

733
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,756
If she came on her own

734
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,175
to prepare all of this
for her father-in-law,

735
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,885
doesn't that mean she forgives you?

736
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,471
Isn't this some kind of silent message

737
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,683
that she's done with what she was doing
and coming back to the family?

738
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,643
That would be a relief.

739
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:25,272
Let's go help her prepare the food today.

740
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,150
But I just got my nails done.

741
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,985
Please cooperate this time too!

742
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,195
In her eyes, you're an accomplice.

743
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,072
Why am I an accomplice?

744
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,699
You're the one who cheated, not me.

745
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,201
Good job on saying something
so blasphemous

746
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,245
on the anniversary of your father's death.

747
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,540
It'll be lucky
if your father doesn't get indigestion

748
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,126
after eating the food today.

749
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:58,722
Jeong-suk.

750
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,475
Is there anything I can help with?

751
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,773
Don't cut the radish too small
for the bean sprout soup.

752
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,192
Cut it long like this, like a bean sprout.

753
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,693
-Like this?
-Yes.

754
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,154
The same goes for the chive
and scallion pancakes.

755
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,991
You can't cut the food
that will be offered into short pieces.

756
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,410
Jeez, but you already know
all this so well.

757
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,412
What's the point of me knowing?

758
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,625
I can't do this forever.

759
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,628
What?

760
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:36,676
Honey, can I make them like this?

761
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:47,646
Watch carefully. Not in the middle,
but at the one-third point.

762
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,857
So the red side of the crab meat
can be seen from the front.

763
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,817
Okay.

764
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,194
Then a yellow radish.

765
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,320
Okay.

766
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,446
The same goes for the chives.

767
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,366
Make the broader side show from the front,
not the narrower side.

768
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,617
-I see.
-I see.

769
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,036
Mushrooms as well.

770
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,875
And next goes the ham.
That way the colors are pretty like this.

771
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:13,713
And then at the end,
one last piece of red crab meat.

772
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,260
Memorial services are all about care.

773
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,387
You need to do it like this
so it looks good,

774
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,015
and so the egg, flour, and water
will stick properly and make it cook well.

775
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,310
-Use this one as an example and follow it.
-Okay.

776
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,355
It's a mere formality,
so don't put too much effort in.

777
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,283
What are you doing?

778
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,617
What?

779
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,248
I think

780
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,627
we should stop with the memorial service.

781
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:41,134
We should just gather as a family
to pray and share a meal

782
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,969
on this day from now on.

783
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:45,931
Why all of a sudden?

784
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,599
We're Christians,

785
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,684
so your father must have
passed on to heaven.

786
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,895
So what is the point of this?

787
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,274
And it isn't right.
It's too much work on Jeong-suk's part.

788
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,151
Just look at today.

789
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,820
She just stood in the kitchen all day
and worked so hard.

790
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,532
You can do it next year onwards, Mother.

791
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,912
As you already know, I'm a bad cook.

792
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,332
Before you married into the family,
my mother-in-law took care of things.

793
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,418
Ever since you came,
you took care of everything so well.

794
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,338
So I never had the time to learn to cook.

795
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,006
You can learn now.

796
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,717
-I can help too.
-Come on!

797
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,846
I'm saying
I don't want to do this anymore!

798
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,934
I don't understand why you want
to stop doing Father's memorial service.

799
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,693
Grandma, do you have a boyfriend?

800
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:45,907
The thing is…

801
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:52,163
Yes, I have a person I'm seeing.

802
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,044
I don't know
how things will end up with him,

803
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,588
so continuing to hold
memorial services for your father

804
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,757
does make me uncomfortable.

805
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,017
So you're saying you have a boyfriend?

806
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,728
Do you have marriage in mind?

807
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,645
Why?

808
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,731
Is there a reason I can't?

809
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,815
I'm single.

810
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,863
To think she has a boyfriend at that age.

811
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,865
This is absurd.

812
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,996
I don't know if you're grasping this,

813
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,124
but you're going to get yourself
a new father-in-law.

814
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,126
Head to your room. I'll do it alone.

815
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:42,088
No, I was too inattentive with the chores.
I'll help out the best I can from now on.

816
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,967
Sure, learning this will be good for you.

817
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,595
Since I won't be here anymore.

818
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,062
What is that supposed to mean?

819
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,490
This is the last memorial service
I'll prepare.

820
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,160
Let's…

821
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,245
get a divorce.

822
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:16,790
Divorce?

823
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,878
I saw your car
in the hospital parking lot.

824
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,672
You had the disability sticker I received,

825
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:28,843
and you parked your car
right in front of the hospital entrance

826
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,470
where the accessible parking is.

827
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,013
DRIVER WITH DISABILITY

828
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,351
ACCESSIBLE PARKING

829
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:40,980
You put my disability sticker on your car…

830
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,028
and drove around Seung-hi.

831
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,036
The thought of that made me laugh.

832
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,043
The fact that I lived my life

833
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,255
caring for and putting
this lousy guy on a pedestal

834
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:10,260
made me feel so pathetic and stupid.

835
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,595
And then suddenly,

836
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,973
I had this thought.

837
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,436
All of this isn't just your fault.

838
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,774
Your mother failed
to teach you right from wrong.

839
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:30,321
And I was so permissive
in every single regard.

840
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,825
Our responsibility in this isn't any less.

841
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,002
I'd like to make a report.

842
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:48,590
Someone is illegally parked
in an accessible parking spot.

843
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,136
The driver has
a disability sticker on his car.

844
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,638
But he's nondisabled.

845
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,642
Yes.

846
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,394
I've made my decision.

847
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,772
I think the time has come

848
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:10,445
when it'll be okay if we're just Jung-min
and I-rang's parents.

849
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,240
As the father of my children,
I can let things slide.

850
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,783
But…

851
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,162
as my husband,

852
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,123
you no longer…

853
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,667
hold any meaning to me.

854
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,922
I don't want to hate you anymore.

855
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,799
I just don't feel the need
to hate you anymore.

856
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,428
It's already over…

857
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,681
between the two of us.

858
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:43,645
I want to be liberated from this hell.

859
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,190
Let's split up.

860
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,112
Let's get a divorce.

861
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,430
Don't put on an act.

862
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,182
Get up.

863
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,393
Get up!

864
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,069
Honey.

865
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,779
Honey, open your eyes. Come on.

866
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,114
Honey.

867
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,699
In-ho!

868
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,617
What's with you?

869
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,035
In-ho, open your eyes.

870
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,204
Honey!

871
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,333
Honey, please wake up!

872
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,006
DOCTOR CHA

873
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,863
I don't want to get a divorce.

874
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,407
Use this opportunity
to play the role of a good husband.

875
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,201
Mr. Seo In-ho. It's already too late.

876
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,203
Mom, are you in pain? What's wrong?

877
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,706
Don't let my mom know
what's going on between us for now.

878
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,583
The professor in charge of Grandma.

879
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,877
It's Professor Choi Seung-hi.

880
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,630
Did you accept my mother
as your patient on purpose?

881
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,591
Isn't that up to you?

882
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:43,222
