EPISODE 14

3
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,725
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO

4
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,478
Mom.

5
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,645
Eun-seo!

6
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,318
Are you treating me because it's payday?

7
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,446
Of course. It'll be a full-course meal,
including dessert.

8
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,365
What are we eating?

9
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,618
Let's see. Beef?

10
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,119
Sounds good?

11
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,209
Why isn't she picking up?

12
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,377
Did something urgent come up?

13
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,630
Who are you calling like that?

14
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,548
It's the hospital.

15
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,093
I guess you're nervous that Seung-hi is
in charge of my mother.

16
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,261
What are you on about?

17
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,430
Someone might hear you.

18
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,516
You listen carefully.

19
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,477
My mother may find out one day
but now is not the time.

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,438
If you make a mistake
and my mother finds out about our divorce

21
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,191
before she's treated and discharged, then…

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,026
I won't hold back.

23
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:53,071
Of course.
But we haven't gotten a divorce.

24
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,697
Welcome.

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,657
There you are.

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,783
-Hello.
-Hey.

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,618
Mother, you're here.

28
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,914
Yes, I feel bad for bothering you
when you're so busy.

29
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,457
No, it's fine.

30
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,377
Even busier people do
at least this much for their families.

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,879
-Let's go in, Mother. Let's go, Mom.
-Okay.

32
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,893
Eun-seo, you have to eat
a lot today, okay?

33
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,188
Do you see this?
I'm wearing elastic pants.

34
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,692
Okay, let's eat until those pants rip.

35
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,363
How dare you try to seduce my man?

36
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,281
-Mother!
-No!

37
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,199
-There must have been a misunderstanding!
-Mother!

38
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,661
-You must be mistaken!
-Mother!

39
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,746
Please let go of her!
Let go first, and we can talk.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,790
Ma'am, let go of her hand first.

41
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,208
-Are you okay?
-What do we do?

42
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,501
Mother?

43
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,794
Look at this.

44
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,256
So you're the son who had an affair
and raised a secret love child?

45
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,258
Be quiet!

46
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,010
No, Ms. Oh. It's not what you think!

47
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:57,969
Please cover your ears!

48
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,306
Like mother like son,
both of you are cheaters!

49
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,141
Is it in your genes?

50
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,934
-Let go.
-Please be quiet!

51
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,066
Ma'am, what did you just say?

52
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,322
Did you just say he had an affair
and has a secret love child?

53
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,656
Yes!

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,451
He had an affair with his first love
and has a daughter.

55
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,869
Did you not know?

56
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,394
Welcome.

57
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,572
Gosh, Grandma.

58
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,325
Goodness.

59
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,248
Excuse me.

60
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,958
Ms. Kwak.

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,334
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,127
Hey, let's go.

63
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,629
Go where?

64
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,048
Ms. Kwak.

65
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,760
I'll contact you soon.
I'll explain everything then.

66
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,513
-Come on.
-An affair is an affair!

67
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,348
What other explanation is needed?

68
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,434
Let go! I'm not going to stand back!

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,479
Wait.

70
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,856
Let's go out and talk for a minute.

71
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,900
Let go.

72
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,196
What are you two doing here?

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,490
We came to eat.
Why else would we come here?

74
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,410
Just by coincidence?

75
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,590
Did all of you know about this?

76
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,261
Ms. Kwak.

77
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,223
Jung-min and I-rang too?

78
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,896
Jeong-suk, did you know too?

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,606
Mom.

80
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,444
Mom…

81
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,366
Where did In-ho go?

82
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,163
Of course it's by coincidence.
Do you think we stalk you?

83
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,791
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,294
I'm all out of sorts right now.

85
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,796
But the situation here isn't great.

86
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm sorry, but can you go eat
somewhere else?

87
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,760
Why should we do that?

88
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,095
-Seung-hi.
-I don't want to hide anymore.

89
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,265
I don't want to look pathetic
in front of Eun-seo anymore.

90
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,018
If you go in there right now,
you won't look pathetic.

91
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,895
You'll look downright deplorable.

92
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,438
Seung-hi, Eun-seo, please.

93
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,692
Save me just this once, please?

94
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,986
Seo In-ho, you bastard. Where are you?

95
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,289
Okay?

96
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,415
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,209
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,419
Bye.

99
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,118
Let us go to my place.

100
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,875
Does that include me?

101
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,727
Shall we go to another beef restaurant?

102
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,522
No, let's change the menu.
What do you want to eat?

103
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,901
Are you still dating Dad?

104
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,491
You're not legally married
and it's not like there's a custody issue.

105
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,076
So why are you still with him?

106
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,536
Eun-seo.

107
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,291
You'll understand once you meet
someone you like later on.

108
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,253
These things aren't easy.

109
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,590
I understand that it isn't easy.

110
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,472
Do you not want to eat?

111
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,682
I'm not in the mood to have a meal.

112
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,727
Let's go and let off some steam.

113
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,482
-It's so spicy.
-It's spicy?

114
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,776
You actually spend money
on something this spicy?

115
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,989
You feel a sense of catharsis
if you eat something this spicy.

116
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,494
Mom, you shouldn't have any more.
You had gastric cramps recently.

117
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,704
It's okay. I'll have a little more.

118
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,874
This is actually kind of addictive.

119
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,917
-Right?
-Yes.

120
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,005
Mom.

121
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,592
Let's go back to the US.

122
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,678
Let's go back

123
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,597
and start over.

124
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517
You and me.

125
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,649
Do you

126
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,735
really have a child out of wedlock?

127
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,909
I'm sorry, Mother.

128
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,705
I guess it's true
since you're saying you're sorry.

129
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,625
Who is the woman?

130
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,962
That lady before said
it was with your first love…

131
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,426
Don't tell me…

132
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,138
Is it the professor in charge of me?

133
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,015
Professor Choi Seung-hi?

134
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,768
Mom…

135
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,397
That's why you wanted me
to switch doctors? Right?

136
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,692
The truth is…

137
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,901
I'm sorry, Mother.

138
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,444
What I did is unforgivable.

139
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,753
These are the medicine
and expensive cosmetics

140
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,922
that your mother gave to me as gifts.

141
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:50,840
Take them back.

142
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,175
But the cosmetics did nothing wrong--

143
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,468
I thought it was strange

144
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,554
when your mother started
giving me expensive gifts

145
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,848
because she never did
anything like that before.

146
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,560
But now I know
that she bought these things for me

147
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,229
because she felt guilty
about what her son had done.

148
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,483
Do you think I can take
and use these knowing that?

149
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,569
Mom.

150
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,904
Mom, don't worry too much.

151
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,825
We'll resolve all this one way or another.

152
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,369
Exactly how will you resolve this?

153
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,622
I'm mad at you too.

154
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,041
You had surgery and barely survived.

155
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,959
Why would you keep this bottled up?

156
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,713
You work in the same place as that woman!

157
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,966
You must have felt such fury
every single day!

158
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,353
Fine.

159
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,024
It's pointless for me to say
what's right and wrong now.

160
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,568
But, In-ho.

161
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,570
Yes, Mother.

162
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,282
People can make mistakes
and do the wrong thing.

163
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,159
But…

164
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,245
what separates humans from animals

165
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,625
is that humans can repent for their sins
and ask for forgiveness.

166
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,753
No matter what happens between you two,

167
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,215
you should sincerely ask my daughter,
whom you've hurt, for forgiveness.

168
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,138
Mother, what I did was wrong.

169
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,059
I'll spend the rest of my life
reflecting and asking for forgiveness.

170
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,145
Please help her change her mind.

171
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,564
She wants to divorce me.

172
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,318
That matter is up to you two.

173
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,325
Get up. I have to go to the hospital.

174
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,162
Go to the hospital?

175
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,498
I have to go to the hospital
and get my things!

176
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,808
Mom, you can't be discharged right now.
Let's go tomorrow.

177
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,476
You deal with the procedures.

178
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,688
I want to sleep comfortably
in my own home.

179
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,232
Let's hear the results
before you get discharged.

180
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,151
If you were me,
would you want to stay here?

181
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,702
Yes, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

182
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,079
Right now?

183
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,248
The patient's brain MRI came out.

184
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,584
She had a headache for two months, right?

185
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,543
Yes, that's right.

186
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,170
If you look at the image,

187
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,839
it's white to the right
of the middle cerebral artery.

188
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,341
A cerebral infarction occurred
as the blood wasn't able to flow there.

189
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,053
If you look at the start
of the right internal carotid artery

190
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,891
and the left vertebral artery,
both show signs of stenosis.

191
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,685
But thankfully, fibrinolytic therapy
can be done right away.

192
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,395
And we want to proceed immediately.

193
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,022
Yes, okay.

194
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:02,948
Doctor.

195
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,200
You must've been worried.

196
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,368
All the blood clots were broken down well.

197
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,705
She can get better right away,
but it can differ for each case.

198
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:13,000
We'll follow up on her vitals
and symptoms in the ICU

199
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,211
and monitor her progress
through imaging tests.

200
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,420
I see.

201
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,714
Thank you, Professor.

202
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,632
Sure.

203
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,398
Mom.

204
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,067
Is it okay?

205
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,736
Yes, of course.

206
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,821
It's okay. You did well.

207
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,739
Okay?

208
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:28,200
CHOI SEUNG-HI
IN OFFICE

209
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,707
PATIENT NAME: OH DEOK-RYE
DIAGNOSIS: RA (RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS)

210
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,228
Ms. Oh Deok-rye received
many localized injections in her joints

211
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,522
and was admitted
after visiting many departments.

212
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,317
But she's very depressed
as her pain still hasn't improved.

213
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,402
Dr. Cha must be very worried.

214
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,154
What on earth is the issue?

215
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,366
She has pain in both shoulders,
her neck, and thighs.

216
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,035
She has severe early morning stiffness
that makes it hard to move.

217
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,161
She can't climb stairs either.

218
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,874
Over six months, she had six kilograms of
weight loss, hot flashes, and asthenia,

219
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,585
so she was diagnosed
and treated for rheumatoid arthritis.

220
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,212
But there was no improvement.

221
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,297
Are there no issues with her labs
and image tests?

222
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,842
Her ESR and CRP levels have gone up.
Her tumor markers are normal.

223
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,513
And her ANA, RF, and Anti-CCP are too.

224
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,723
Her electromyography
and electroneurography tests,

225
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,017
and even her WBBS have normal results.

226
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,562
Has she taken fibromyalgia
or psychiatric medication?

227
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,357
Yes, but there was very little effect.

228
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,569
All her neurological exams show
no issue either.

229
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,701
Mom.

230
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,161
What are you doing? Why are you packing?

231
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,871
I told you I'm going home.

232
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,832
Why should I stay here?

233
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,959
You have to be treated!

234
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,711
Who said I wasn't going to be treated?

235
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,212
There are hospitals everywhere.

236
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,133
How could I get treated by those bastards
who hurt my daughter?

237
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,720
Mom, please. Don't be like this.

238
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,971
-Please, Mom.
-Move.

239
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,765
-Mom, don't do this!
-Move!

240
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,603
Let go.

241
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,982
Your daughter is a doctor
at this hospital!

242
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,362
Mom.

243
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,742
You can be treated
at a different hospital…

244
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,910
but I…

245
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,872
I…

246
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,042
I don't want you to be sick
somewhere without me.

247
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,086
I don't want to even imagine it!

248
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,509
Mom, I can't fix your illness,

249
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,512
but at the very least,
I can be with you here.

250
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,266
If I'm not with you…

251
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,437
You're just going to say
you're okay again!

252
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,322
Stop crying, you're an adult.

253
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,994
I don't want you to be sick.

254
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,207
You know I'm not just saying this, right?

255
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,043
Gusan University Hospital
is the best in the country.

256
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,046
Of course I know.
After all, my daughter works here.

257
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,715
And…

258
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,301
And what?

259
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,231
I get an employee discount here.

260
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,694
Jeez!

261
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,821
Goodness.

262
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,864
Unbelievable.

263
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,495
Mom, you should get treated
and get better quickly, okay?

264
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,958
You know that
you're all that I have, right?

265
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,587
Let's get you better soon, okay?

266
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,687
Come in.

267
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,445
What can I…

268
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,162
Hello.

269
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,129
What brings you here?

270
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,930
I don't have a lot of time,
so maybe next time--

271
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,390
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:44,975
For what?

273
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,561
For causing Eun-seo's arm injury.

274
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,399
I heard she can't go to the art school
she wants to this year.

275
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,068
You should apologize to Eun-seo.

276
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,778
I'll apologize to her too.

277
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,198
I will.

278
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,159
But I came here to ask a favor.

279
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,079
-A favor?
-Please break up with my father.

280
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,708
I know you came first before my mom.

281
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,461
Eun-seo told me everything.

282
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,505
And asked me to give my dad to her.

283
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,800
My dad

284
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,886
may not be a perfect father.

285
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,223
But still,
I'm scared of losing him entirely.

286
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,769
I'm not expecting this favor for free.

287
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,562
I'll receive punishment too.

288
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,731
I'll give up

289
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,316
on art school…

290
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,320
just like Eun-seo.

291
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,989
And…

292
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,575
please save my grandmother too.

293
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,084
I-rang.

294
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,836
Your hair has grown so much.

295
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,215
You look like a grown woman.

296
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,301
Grandma, I'm all grown up now.

297
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,971
Jeez, as if.

298
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,889
You're still a baby in my eyes.

299
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,977
-Come here.
-I said I'm all grown up.

300
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,233
I-rang.

301
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,153
When you were four or five,

302
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:26,159
I would pick you up from daycare,
and you would come running to me.

303
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,954
You would scream "Grandma!"
and plop into my arms.

304
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,539
Goodness.

305
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,210
You were so pretty then,
I thought my heart would burst.

306
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,631
Even now, my heart feels soft and fuzzy

307
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,468
whenever I think of that moment.

308
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,221
I-rang.

309
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,976
I wasn't able to raise your mother

310
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,731
with the same care
and love as you received.

311
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,319
So make sure you give your mom
all the love you can.

312
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,946
Okay, I will.

313
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,325
Gosh.

314
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,871
Are you being cute only to Grandma again?

315
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,541
Grandma's sick.
Hurry up and get down from there.

316
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,627
Mom, Grandma said I was prettier than you.

317
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,884
-Mom, did you really say that?
-Jeez, pay no attention to it.

318
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,386
How could you say that?
Your daughter should be prettier.

319
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,346
Look.

320
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,764
You're scaring me.

321
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,900
Aren't you hungry?
Do you want to eat something?

322
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,985
Do you have time right now?

323
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,949
It's so comfortable to move around
sitting like this.

324
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,454
You should get better soon and walk.

325
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,791
I don't like pushing you around
in a wheelchair.

326
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,251
Jeong-suk.

327
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,295
Yes?

328
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,923
The stars are so pretty.

329
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,054
They really are.

330
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:16,686
Don't consider your life
to be too miserable.

331
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,191
Life can't only be filled
with good things.

332
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,614
You have Jung-min and I-rang.

333
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,326
And after going in circles,
you became a doctor again.

334
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,870
Right.

335
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,792
If I died now,
I wouldn't be too sad about it

336
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,254
I'll be going
after seeing so many good things.

337
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:43,880
I mean it.

338
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,189
What?

339
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,692
Did we turn off the lights?

340
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,651
Did we?

341
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,572
-Ta-da.
-Grandma.

342
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,656
You startled me.

343
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,035
What is this? It's not even my birthday.

344
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,579
Are parties only for birthdays?

345
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,706
We prepared this so you can smile.

346
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,294
Ta-da! There are presents too.

347
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,964
My goodness.

348
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,507
These are all so expensive.

349
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,509
Where did you kids get the money for this?

350
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,428
I saved up my allowance.

351
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,806
When I would play house with you
when I was young,

352
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,559
I remember you saying
you wanted a trench coat

353
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,478
and a pretty handbag
like the one Audrey Hepburn wore.

354
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,191
Jung-min bought the handbag.

355
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,029
We played house
before you went to elementary school.

356
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,238
You remembered that?

357
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,199
Gosh.

358
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,993
Who do you two take after
to be this smart?

359
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,661
What do you mean by who?

360
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,079
They take after their mother.

361
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,124
Grandma, the candles.

362
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,505
You must be so happy, Mom.

363
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:14,554
OH DEOK-RYE

364
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,308
It's so pretty.

365
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:19,851
Mom, look.

366
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,314
I picked them out.

367
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,911
MY DAUGHTER EUN-SEO
MOM, WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

368
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,122
I HAVE A LOT OF MATERIALS TO LOOK OVER
SO I'LL BE LATE

369
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,665
DON'T WAIT FOR ME AND GO TO BED

370
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,085
I LOVE YOU, MY DAUGHTER

371
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,951
Jeong-suk.

372
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,289
Ma'am.

373
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,582
Gosh.

374
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,752
You must be busy.
Why did you come all the way here?

375
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,711
Ma'am.

376
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,338
Please don't say that.
Of course I should come.

377
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,925
It's tough, isn't it?

378
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,218
No, it's fine.

379
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,137
You didn't have to buy all this.

380
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,984
Your mom looks so gaunt.

381
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,445
No diagnosis yet?

382
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,114
They're doing various tests.

383
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,241
I'm looking into it too.

384
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,243
But it's not easy.

385
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,078
Jeong-suk.

386
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,748
My brother's friend is a professor

387
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,666
in the Neurology Department
at Aseong Hospital.

388
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,419
How about you take your mother there?

389
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:57,879
Aseong Hospital?

390
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,840
How is their Neurology Department?

391
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,218
What's there to say?
It's the best in the country.

392
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,222
I know you want to keep your mom
by your side,

393
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,849
but her treatment takes the top priority.

394
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,769
Think about it
if there's no progress here.

395
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:16,147
I'll ask that professor
to pay special attention to your mother.

396
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,201
Yes, Chief.

397
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,329
Ms. Oh Deok-rye?

398
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,957
I'll go over right away.

399
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,923
Dr. Cha.

400
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,844
I have to tell you something
about your mother.

401
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,595
You can tell me here.

402
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,140
I did a biopsy
after discussing Ms. Oh's condition

403
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,476
with professors in the Rheumatology
and Neurosurgery Departments.

404
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,395
Based on the biopsy
of her temporal artery,

405
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,147
there was large cell infiltration
and intimal hyperplasia.

406
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,316
It's giant cell arteritis.

407
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,360
Your mother has no risk factors,

408
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,487
but the GCA caused
her cerebral infarction.

409
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,200
My diagnosis is that your mother is
suffering from polymyalgia rheumatica.

410
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,328
I heard she's moving hospitals.

411
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,165
Even if she does,
have prednisone administered to her first.

412
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,294
Even better, have her treated here.

413
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,547
Not only is she your mother,

414
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,841
but also she's my patient.

415
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,809
Also,

416
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,478
take care of your own health too.

417
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,522
You don't look well.

418
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,688
Hello.

419
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,782
Gosh, Dr. Cha. You're here too.

420
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,953
Ms. Oh Deok-rye,
how are you feeling today?

421
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,664
I feel so much better than before.

422
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,874
My shoulder barely hurts,

423
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,336
and I have enough strength in my legs
to go on walks.

424
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,505
Thank you so much, Professor.

425
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,800
It's Professor Choi here
who you should be thanking.

426
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,636
Professor Choi worked hard on this.

427
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,222
We'll monitor you for a few days.

428
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,848
You can be discharged afterward.

429
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,519
-Okay.
-Thank you for being so considerate.

430
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,104
Dr. Cha, you have gone through a lot.

431
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,272
You can relax now.

432
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,273
Goodbye, ma'am.

433
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,252
What is it?

434
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,756
Thank you…

435
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,844
for treating my mother.

436
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,140
But that doesn't mean I forgive you.

437
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,683
No.

438
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,144
I can't forgive you.

439
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,647
But still, I'm grateful for what you did.

440
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,525
I thought I should say thank you.

441
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,489
I-rang came to see me.

442
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,579
She said she was sorry
she injured Eun-seo.

443
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,541
And she said she'd give up
on art school this year too.

444
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,628
Tell her to go to the school she wants.

445
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,841
And she doesn't have to feel guilty
about Eun-seo anymore.

446
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,179
We…

447
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,349
hurt our kids too much.

448
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,047
Something feels ominous.

449
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,228
DIVORCE APPLICATION
(APPOINTMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS)

450
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,437
SEO IN-HO, CHA JEONG-SUK

451
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,482
What is this?

452
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,608
Isn't it obvious?

453
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,318
It's a divorce application.

454
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,154
Having it by mutual agreement
is better than going to trial, right?

455
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,158
I'll text you the necessary paperwork,
so let me know when you're ready.

456
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,744
I can go by myself to turn in the papers.

457
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,330
How can you just act as you please?

458
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,290
A divorce can't be done alone.

459
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,918
I won't cooperate
if you'll do things however you want!

460
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:30,920
I mean,

461
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,716
do you really have to do this
when your mother is still recovering?

462
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,219
Yes, I need to do this.

463
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:43,224
This divorce has become more urgent
and important to me than anything else.

464
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,142
My daughter.

465
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,730
Your daughters are suffering.

466
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,859
The kids are in pain because of us.

467
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,988
My mother is recovering,

468
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,199
and I don't want to use anything else
as an excuse to delay this.

469
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,367
I want to end things quickly.

470
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,827
I refuse to get divorced!

471
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,496
So if you want a divorce,

472
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,167
you can take this to court.

473
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,215
I'm appalled at your audacity.

474
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,760
You're the spouse at fault!
You're the one who's causing the divorce!

475
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,096
That's why I got down on my knees
and apologized!

476
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,931
And I'm trying my best to please you!

477
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,434
If you take this to court…

478
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,104
I'm going to stop the divorce,

479
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,523
even if I have to spend my entire fortune.

480
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,007
What are you doing here?

481
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,053
We used to come here
to avoid meeting our co-workers.

482
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,137
I know.

483
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,223
You said you'd do everything
you can for your wife,

484
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,642
so why did you come to a place
we often went together?

485
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,645
I just came.

486
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:18,778
What do you expect me to do
when my legs just brought me here?

487
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,576
I mean,

488
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,787
what is going on?

489
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,831
You're treating me to drinks
at a place like this?

490
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,751
Jeez, do you have to pay all the time?

491
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,963
I wanted to treat you once too.

492
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,257
Cheers.

493
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:44,929
Jeez, I guess you're feeling relaxed
now that your mother is recovering.

494
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,100
Maybe it's because of that,
but I feel like I'm in a hurry.

495
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,184
What?

496
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,312
I told In-ho that I want a divorce.

497
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,355
Really?

498
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,983
I gave him the papers.

499
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,943
What did he say?

500
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,321
He doesn't want a divorce

501
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,240
and told me to go to court.

502
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,659
Is he crazy?

503
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,869
I'm sorry!

504
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:13,165
Seung-hi, I'm really sorry.
I deserve to die.

505
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,167
Right?

506
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,586
Please be quiet.

507
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,093
My life has been…

508
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,763
like a shirt that I buttoned up wrong
from the very start.

509
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,935
These buttons.

510
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,563
They were fastened onto you,

511
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,024
but I mistakenly
fastened them onto Jeong-suk.

512
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:43,404
I tried to unbutton and button them again.
And then I kept trying.

513
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,865
But in the end,

514
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,285
all the buttons fell off.

515
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,831
This is all my fault though, right?

516
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,291
At least you know that.

517
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:59,295
But now she's asking for a divorce?

518
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,629
A divorce!

519
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,717
How could she do that to me?

520
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,721
I didn't do everything right.

521
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,057
But…

522
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,434
I even got on my knees

523
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,479
and begged her to forgive me.

524
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,316
You got on your knees?

525
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,901
Yes!

526
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,694
Why are you telling me this?

527
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,289
Drink slowly.

528
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,666
Sure.

529
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,920
It's fine to start a new life.

530
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,048
There are plenty of better fish
in the sea.

531
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,009
Once you let go of Seo In-ho,
you can reel in Roy Kim.

532
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,262
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

533
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,431
What do you mean by nonsense?

534
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,849
I have reasonable suspicion.

535
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,520
Hey, in what way or form
is that reasonable?

536
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,439
Did he confess
that he liked me or something?

537
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,565
Jeez.

538
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,197
Okay, now it's your turn to talk.

539
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,617
About Jeong-suk.

540
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,286
I…

541
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,627
No.

542
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,296
Not really.

543
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:25,756
Well.

544
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,676
He didn't say that.

545
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,055
But do you really have
no feelings for him?

546
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,765
Hey.

547
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,977
I don't have the energy
to think about that right now.

548
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,395
My mother is sick.

549
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,730
I'm about to get a divorce.

550
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,817
My daughter is in 12th grade. I'm working.

551
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,319
My mind is all over the place.

552
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,739
But if you get a divorce,
will you really be okay

553
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,034
seeing Seo In-ho and Choi Seung-hi
live a good life together?

554
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,457
Can the two of them…

555
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,210
really live a good life together?

556
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,172
If I were Seung-hi,

557
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,551
I think I'd finally see things
for what they really are.

558
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,473
Say there is a limited edition handbag
you really want

559
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,267
and you're really
anxious about it selling out.

560
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,269
But once you actually
get your hands on it,

561
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,898
that feeling of happiness
doesn't last long.

562
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,193
You just put it away in your closet
and forget about it.

563
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,277
That's true.

564
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,195
Come on!

565
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,531
Hey, a handbag isn't
the same thing as a man.

566
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,951
It's different.

567
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,536
A handbag is better.

568
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,622
Cheers.

569
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,052
Pull yourself together.

570
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,272
Get up.

571
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,317
Get up!

572
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,113
I said get up!

573
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,075
I can't believe this.

574
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,287
Come on, one, two.

575
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,537
-Did you call a designated driver?
-I called one earlier.

576
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,163
Go first.

577
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,542
I'll walk a bit and take a taxi.

578
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,501
Okay.

579
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,296
-Get home safe.
-Okay.

580
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,630
Jeong-suk.

581
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,056
Don't worry.

582
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,643
Go.

583
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,812
-Bye.
-Bye.

584
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,606
-Don't trip and fall.
-I get it.

585
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,109
-Get home safely.
-I told you, I get it!

586
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,040
It's nice that you two have a place to go
even if you go your separate ways.

587
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,877
Seo In-ho can go to Choi Seung-hi.

588
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,006
And Cha Jeong-suk can go to Roy.

589
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,469
No.

590
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,305
Not really.

591
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,098
Really?

592
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,477
I know that my feelings right now

593
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,897
could cause trouble for Dr. Cha.

594
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,232
So right now…

595
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:14,818
it's a no.

596
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,197
Let's just say I feigned ignorance
and said, "No."

597
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,078
That's scarier than saying you like her.

598
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,130
I'm lonely.

599
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,215
So lonely.

600
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,883
I need another drink.

601
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,356
PROFESSOR PARK HO-WON

602
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,319
Your call cannot be connected.
Redirecting to voicemail…

603
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,572
Did he take my money and go off the grid?

604
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,324
It's unfair that
I'm being labeled an adulteress.

605
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,409
Now my money's gone too.

606
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,495
Wait, do I have to report this
to the police?

607
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,213
Mother, you're up early.

608
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,424
Why did you stay out without calling?

609
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,426
Were you in surgery all night?

610
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,761
Yes, I had a difficult patient.

611
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:06,972
Hey.

612
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,476
This came from the court. What is it?

613
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,643
The court?

614
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,353
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
TO SEO IN-HO

615
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,484
DIVORCE PETITION

616
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,694
Oh, my. Is this a divorce petition?

617
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,489
For crying out loud!

618
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,574
Are you two really getting divorced?

619
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:28,744
What have you been doing this whole time?
You should have won her back by now!

620
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,288
You'll be the death of me.

621
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:37,544
So this is how our family gets destroyed.

622
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,721
What on earth is this?
What is the meaning of this?

623
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,264
You know what it is.

624
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,477
How could you send me a divorce petition

625
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,437
after asking me
to divorce by mutual agreement?

626
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,358
Are you really going
to end things with me?

627
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,401
Do you want it so badly?

628
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,738
I wanted to end things quietly
with a divorce by mutual agreement.

629
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,074
But you refused.

630
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,200
You told me to go to court.

631
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,744
I expected that, so I prepared in advance.

632
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:14,081
Did you think I really meant that?
I said it because I didn't want a divorce!

633
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,001
Seriously, do you not know
how to read between the lines?

634
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,964
I'm trying to tell you that
I'm determined to get this divorce.

635
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,471
What's the real reason…

636
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,850
you want to get divorced this badly?

637
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,935
What does that mean?

638
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,104
Is it because of that punk?

639
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,064
Roy Kimberley?

640
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,150
Don't get ahead of yourself.

641
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,528
Do you think
that decent young man is into you?

642
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:47,823
My gosh.

643
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,866
Jeez.

644
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,120
You're the most pathetic loser
I've ever seen.

645
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,414
Thank you so much for helping me

646
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,833
get rid of the little affection
I had left for you.

647
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,377
Jeez.

648
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,797
You can't just leave like this.

649
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,173
We're not done talking!

650
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,642
Ms. Park, can I please have
Shin Gyu-seon's chart?

651
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,312
One moment.

652
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,231
Hello?

653
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:25,027
Hello? This is the Seocho Police Station's
Women's and Juvenile Affairs Division.

654
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,737
Is this Roy Kimberley?

655
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,531
I called to give you good news.

656
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,408
Good news?

657
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,789
Dr. Cha!

658
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,211
Did something good happen?

659
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,212
Yes.

660
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,673
And I wanted to tell you first.

661
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,468
Really?

662
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,178
You really found your family?

663
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,846
I can't believe this.

664
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,932
So are you going to meet your family?

665
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,017
Yes.

666
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,438
They say I have an older brother
and older sisters.

667
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,148
I see.

668
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,444
They raised them, so I wonder why
they put me up for adoption.

669
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:15,786
I heard that families
with financial difficulties back then

670
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,456
would sometimes
put their youngest up for adoption.

671
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,584
That way, they would go to college
in a good environment.

672
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,253
What's the point of a good environment
if there are no parents?

673
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,048
And I don't understand
the point of college either.

674
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,553
But I still want to meet them.

675
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,974
-I'm curious.
-Yes, you should meet them.

676
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,393
But…

677
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,562
don't have high expectations.

678
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,107
No expectations. I'll keep that in mind.

679
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,318
But, Dr. Cha,

680
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,071
I have a favor to ask.

681
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,072
What is it?

682
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,032
When I go to meet my family,

683
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,661
can you come with me?

684
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,124
I know you're having a hard time lately,
but please come with me.

685
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,125
I'm really nervous,

686
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:04,960
to be honest.

687
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,679
Excuse me.
How do I apply for a leave of absence?

688
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,264
Is something wrong?

689
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,893
I'm planning to enlist,
so I just want to look into it first.

690
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,937
You'll have a hard time if you enlist now.

691
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,480
You should finish your residency first.

692
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,117
What did you just say?

693
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,119
Say it again slowly.

694
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,873
I'm going to the military.

695
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,751
I won't ask you to wait for me.

696
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,753
I thought you were going
after your residency.

697
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,297
I need some time to think.

698
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,133
It's not just
because of Ms. Yoo Ji-seon's incident.

699
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,595
I want to find a specialty that fits me.

700
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,056
I just came to the Surgery Department
because of my father.

701
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,974
Sure.

702
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,018
That's your decision,
so that's fine by me.

703
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,644
But are you breaking up with me?

704
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,521
I never said that.

705
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,983
I'm just saying
you don't have to wait for me.

706
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,736
Hey, be more honest.

707
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,446
Would you be happy
if I date some other guy?

708
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,655
Of course I'd hate it.

709
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,073
Then tell me to wait for you!

710
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,326
Make it clear.

711
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,747
Okay.

712
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,832
Then wait for me.

713
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,668
You better not date some other guy.

714
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,386
Hey.

715
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,638
They're all staring.

716
00:51:59,115 --> 00:51:59,950
This is crazy.

717
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,124
-You can do it exactly like this.
-Yes, okay.

718
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,252
Dr. Cha, your mother
is being discharged today, right?

719
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,211
Yes.

720
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:15,048
Thank you so much for taking care
of my mother this whole time.

721
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,633
Gosh, it was nothing.

722
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,302
We're glad that she's going home healthy.

723
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,097
-Aren't you going to her room?
-I was going to go now.

724
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,932
-Have a good day.
-You too.

725
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,435
Mom.

726
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:28,979
Mom.

727
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,951
MY DAUGHTER

728
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,537
Thanks to you, I'm being discharged.

729
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,122
Yes.

730
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,917
Thank you for making me better
when no one else could.

731
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,547
I thought I was going to wither away
and die like this.

732
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,967
But it feels like
I'm finally living again.

733
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,764
I came to give you this before I leave.

734
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,435
It's not filled with money,

735
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,562
so don't get your hopes up.

736
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,590
TO DOCTOR CHOI SEUNG-HI…

737
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,842
When I looked at you, for a moment,

738
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,512
I felt sympathy and affection for you
like a daughter.

739
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,934
Though I can no longer look at you
with affection,

740
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,394
I still feel that sympathy.

741
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,651
The way I see the world has changed a bit

742
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,862
after suffering from a serious illness.

743
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,658
Before, my daily life seemed like nothing,

744
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,495
but now, it feels so dear and precious.

745
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,008
Mom, do you want some water?

746
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:29,140
So I want to live whatever life
I have left as a kinder person.

747
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:33,353
It may be late,
but that's what I've decided to do.

748
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:42,278
I'm saying this to you
as a fellow woman and mother.

749
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:49,536
Do not abandon your chance
to become a good person and mother.

750
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:59,254
From now on,
live an honorable life for yourself.

751
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:05,844
That is when you'll find real happiness.

752
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,612
Are you very nervous?

753
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,409
I am.

754
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,413
Thank you

755
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,166
for coming with me today.

756
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,211
Let's say I was building rapport.

757
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,215
You can come in now.
Your family is waiting.

758
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:45,633
Okay.

759
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,559
I hope you have a good time with them.

760
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,852
I'll be waiting here.

761
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,896
-Okay.
-Good luck.

762
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,241
I'm nervous.

763
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,094
Hello.

764
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,097
-My name is Roy.
-It's nice to meet you.

765
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,432
Please have a seat.

766
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,023
This is our father.

767
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:46,569
This is my younger sister,
and over there is my younger brother.

768
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,239
Nice to meet you all.

769
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,783
You grew up well.

770
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,493
You grew up to be a good man.

771
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,662
I hear you're a doctor.

772
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,080
Yes.

773
00:56:57,163 --> 00:57:00,291
The only good thing that woman did

774
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,210
was to die early.

775
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:06,923
If you were raised by your mother,
you would've ended up dirt poor.

776
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,007
Father.

777
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,052
Why would you say that here?

778
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,183
I'll be straightforward.

779
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,104
Since you're a doctor,
you'll find it easy to understand.

780
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,442
The reason we found you
was because of our father.

781
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:30,280
Our father has acute leukemia.

782
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,574
So…

783
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:36,286
we need someone
who can do a bone marrow transplant.

784
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,569
Did you have a good meeting?

785
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:12,906
Yes.

786
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,118
I wanted to meet my mother…

787
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,414
but she had already passed away.

788
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,708
I see.

789
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,171
How were your other family members?

790
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,548
Did they look a lot like you?

791
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,280
-Are you going straight to the hospital?
-I should.

792
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:55,907
What about you?

793
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,116
Yes, me too.

794
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,952
Then should we grab a taxi?

795
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:00,995
Okay.

796
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,171
Professor Kim.

797
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,550
Do you want to run to the hospital?

798
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:15,843
From here?

799
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,262
Wait.

800
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,642
It's 9.8km to the hospital from here.

801
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,978
That's a distance we can run, right?

802
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,023
But I don't have my running shoes.

803
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,487
They're the same design.

804
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,405
They are.

805
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,408
-Are our tastes similar?
-Are they?

806
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,287
Shall we start running then?

807
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:43,788
Shall we?

808
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,624
You look really tired.

809
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,293
Yes.

810
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,171
I did some running yesterday,
so I'm really tired.

811
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,674
You should work hard to stay in shape,
with your age and all.

812
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,217
Tell me about it.

813
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,388
Right. Dr. Cha, did you know
you are the Resident of the Month?

814
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,515
What?

815
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,934
Me?

816
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,860
BEST MEDICAL PERSONNEL OF THE MONTH
DR. CHA JEONG-SUK, FAMILY MEDICINE

817
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,165
This is the best.

818
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,292
Thank you.

819
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,981
DOCTOR CHA

820
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,295
Do it as fast as you can.

821
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,423
I have neglected myself.

822
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,843
Did you contribute even a single thing
to the creation of these assets?

823
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,012
Did you not know your wife was ill?

824
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,389
I don't need your liver.

825
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,433
You should give me at least one chance.

826
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:54,145
It seems Professor Roy
has decided to donate his liver.

827
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,898
I'm giving her my liver.
So why are you butting in here?

828
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,983
Make your choice.

829
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:04,614
