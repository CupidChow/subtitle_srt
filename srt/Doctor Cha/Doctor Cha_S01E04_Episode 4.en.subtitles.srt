1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,681
Dr. Cha, were you a housewife
while you weren't working?

3
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,683
Yes.

4
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,185
Your family must be well-off.

5
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,812
What does your husband do?

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,023
My husband?

7
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,649
Your husband.

8
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,413
He's dead.

9
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,968
-Ow!
-Jung-min!

10
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,931
-It's just alcohol. It's fine.
-I'm okay.

11
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,686
It's okay.

12
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,647
Sorry.

13
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,940
Stop it.

14
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,275
-You're unbelievable.
-Give me some tissues.

15
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,402
Dr. Cha.

16
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,404
I sincerely apologize.

17
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,989
For what?

18
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,617
I shouldn't have asked you that.

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,369
It's okay.

20
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,705
But if I may,
may I ask you another rude question?

21
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,874
When did he pass away?

22
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,837
Well…

23
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,924
He's been dead for a long time.

24
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,428
Then may I ask you my final rude question?

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,973
Do you miss him from time to time?

26
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,021
I can't remember.

27
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,234
I can't even remember
if I ever got married at all.

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,536
Let's wrap it up here.

29
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:47,709
Drink up your beers!

30
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,671
About things that will never come back

31
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,674
Next up is the new doctor
Hollywood actors would be jealous of.

32
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,217
Let's invite Professor Roy to the stage.

33
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,385
Come on out!

34
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,307
I will kiss your eyes

35
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,936
As thoughts race through your mind

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:14,027
Let's walk together

37
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,947
After I met you

38
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,537
You can pick who'll go next.

39
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,831
Then I'll pick…

40
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,250
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk.

41
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,004
Me? No.

42
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,339
No. Come on.

43
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,590
I can't sing.

44
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,091
-Cha Jeong-suk!
-Cha Jeong-suk!

45
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,135
-It's okay.
-Cha Jeong-suk!

46
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,845
-Cha Jeong-suk!
-Cha Jeong-suk!

47
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,151
You only live once so make no regrets

48
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,113
Chase after what you truly want

49
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,492
Let's ride a flying magic carpet

50
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,496
Over the magnificent blue sky

51
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,874
Let's ride a red car

52
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,920
Across the magnificent emerald ocean

53
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,423
-Let's ride a flying magic carpet
-Let's ride a flying magic carpet

54
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,302
-Over the magnificent blue sky
-Over the magnificent blue sky

55
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,014
-Let's enjoy this magnificent life
-Let's enjoy this magnificent life

56
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,935
-You and I, us together
-You and I, us together

57
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,190
Goodbye, everyone.

58
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,150
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

59
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,111
Let me say one thing.

60
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,488
Today's group dinner is truly over.

61
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,574
FEEL KARAOKE

62
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,909
Goodbye.

63
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,119
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

64
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,370
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

65
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,038
Professor.

66
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,499
-The designated driver will be here soon.
-Okay.

67
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,583
Excuse me.

68
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,421
How are you all going home?

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,511
I'm planning to stay
at the resident dorms.

70
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,388
What about you?

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,181
I'm…

72
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,689
going to take a taxi.

73
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,585
Then I'll get going first.

74
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,590
Professor!

75
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,968
Which way are you going?

76
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,845
Could you give me a ride?

77
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,516
Would you like that?

78
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,352
-Hop on.
-Really?

79
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,858
Thank you.

80
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,491
-I didn't drink, so no worries.
-Okay.

81
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,999
-I'll go now. Hang tight.
-Okay.

82
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,752
How is it?

83
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,009
I love it.

84
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,430
But I don't like your choice of music.

85
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,066
Dr. Kim.

86
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,861
I feel nauseous.

87
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,345
How dare you?

88
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,387
How dare I?

89
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,014
You may be my senior
at the hospital but not here.

90
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,144
Stay right there.

91
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,071
Dr. Cha, do you feel better?

92
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,240
-Yes.
-Have some water.

93
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,533
Thank you.

94
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,337
I can't believe I'm here

95
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,549
at this hour.

96
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,260
This isn't some place abroad.

97
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,470
Why couldn't you?

98
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,680
Exactly.

99
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,142
It wasn't as if I didn't
have the money or the time.

100
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,728
So I wonder why.

101
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,398
At least you're here now.

102
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,192
How was the bike ride?

103
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,781
It was the first time
riding one in my life.

104
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,450
It was…

105
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,911
truly amazing.

106
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,414
It's hard to explain.

107
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,624
But it was incredible.

108
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,334
You don't need to explain.

109
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,296
It feels great…

110
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,923
to be alive.

111
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,718
It feels great that I can feel

112
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,970
freedom,

113
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,180
hunger,

114
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,474
and exhaustion.

115
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,727
I love it all.

116
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,521
So why does it feel like…

117
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,735
a burning rock is
weighing down on my chest?

118
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,698
Dr. Kim.

119
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,907
Yes?

120
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,577
Thank you for bearing with me

121
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,787
today.

122
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,171
You don't need to thank me.

123
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,049
Let's say I was building rapport.

124
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,259
A bond between a doctor

125
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,094
and his patient.

126
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,221
"Building rapport"?

127
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,184
I like that.

128
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,022
But you know one too many
humiliating things about me

129
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,607
for us to have rapport.

130
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,444
You must think I'm frustrating, right?

131
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,696
I can't deny that.

132
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,033
Why do you continue to live with him?

133
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,035
From what I see,

134
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,621
you seem like a great person to be around.

135
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,041
Is that so?

136
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,586
But you know what?

137
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,506
There are worse husbands than mine.

138
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,843
He wasn't always that cold.

139
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,053
It's just that…

140
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,556
we've been living together
for a while now.

141
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,768
His love for me became weaker,

142
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,021
and he's become less grateful now.

143
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,732
It's just like that.

144
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,776
That's just how life is.

145
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,739
A married couple can't
love each other passionately forever.

146
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,450
Even if that's the case,

147
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,162
he should at least respect you.

148
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,795
I was out of line.

149
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,882
Should we go?

150
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,218
We have work tomorrow.

151
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,399
What does your husband do?

152
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,985
My husband? He's dead.

153
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,361
He's dead.

154
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,487
Professor!

155
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,822
Which way are you going?

156
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,365
Could you give me a ride?

157
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,579
She must be out of her mind.

158
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,539
She must be.

159
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,365
TO MY DAUGHTER

160
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,623
I-rang.

161
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,376
You must be surprised to find this letter.

162
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,507
I'm sure you're having a tough time

163
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,135
because I'm so busy nowadays.

164
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,389
But if you think about it,

165
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,685
you'll have to experience this eventually

166
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,147
since there will come a day
when I won't be around anymore.

167
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,025
That is exactly why

168
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,738
I'd like to live for myself just once.

169
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,452
But that won't change the fact
that I'll always be your mom.

170
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,332
Just like how
I always root for you and your dreams,

171
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,793
just this once,

172
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,379
I hope you can do the same for me too.

173
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,716
What I need the most right now

174
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,510
is your encouragement and support.

175
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,805
I love you, my daughter.

176
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,057
From Mom.

177
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,825
-Jung-min.
-Good morning.

178
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,620
Eat this before the others come.

179
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,997
-What is it?
-Here.

180
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,249
It's gimbap.

181
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,377
It looks good. What about you?

182
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,754
I'm okay.

183
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,047
Thanks, Mom.

184
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:25,966
It's so good.

185
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,053
Hello.

186
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,181
You're having gimbap.

187
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,058
Carbs are the best hangover food.

188
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,310
Where did you get it?

189
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,773
I bought it.

190
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,982
Really?

191
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,234
I can have some, right? Thanks.

192
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,032
This is really good.

193
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,410
Would you like some too?

194
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,205
Did you already eat?

195
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,209
That's Dr. Seo's.

196
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,756
What do you mean?
We share everything here.

197
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,050
-Right?
-Sorry? Yes.

198
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,970
Dr. Seo.

199
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,262
You should eat.

200
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,264
Or she'll eat it all.

201
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,183
This is good.

202
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,143
Where did you buy this?

203
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,105
-Stop it.
-You know what?

204
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,565
It's good, but the rice is too mushy.

205
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,275
-It's too mushy?
-Yes.

206
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,112
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

207
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,154
Look.

208
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,576
-It's about how you clean the bathroom.
-Okay.

209
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,538
I know it's more convenient
to use a lot of products,

210
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,123
but that leaves behind a strong smell.

211
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,916
Then what should I use instead?

212
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,752
My daughter-in-law used stale cola

213
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,046
or old shampoo.

214
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,715
-Okay.
-One more thing.

215
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,301
The ratio of the ingredients
for the detox juice is important.

216
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,886
You added too little fruit

217
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,055
and it tastes too tart.

218
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,016
I made it exactly as you told me to.

219
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,978
Then I guess
you're just not good at making food.

220
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,817
How did you make the juice before?

221
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,279
My daughter-in-law made them taste great
even with the same recipe.

222
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,657
She must've slaved away.

223
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,867
Look.

224
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,995
I can't do this anymore.

225
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,330
Just ask your daughter-in-law
to do it for you.

226
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,499
You'll never find a helper

227
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,376
who'll suit your taste.

228
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,627
Goodness.

229
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,546
Jeez.

230
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,923
Wait.

231
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,884
Ma'am.

232
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,470
We have the prescription ready
for Ms. Jung Seong-a in Room 810

233
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,929
and I've checked the results.

234
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,557
Okay.

235
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,603
Hello, ma'am.

236
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,481
I can't work for your family anymore.

237
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,649
She nitpicks every single thing,

238
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,568
and it stresses me out so much.

239
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,694
I'm quitting today,

240
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,196
-so that's that.
-Ma'am, but--

241
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,837
What on earth--

242
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,051
How could you prescribe
eight ampoules of digoxin?

243
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,803
Did you want the patient to die?

244
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,056
I understand maybe
you were too ignorant to notice,

245
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,809
but didn't it seem weird
to prescribe eight ampoules?

246
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,854
The Cardiology Department
said to prescribe 2mg of digoxin so…

247
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,065
They told you to give 2mg in an IV drip?

248
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,359
Don't you mean "two ampoules"?

249
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,781
Are you so clueless you can't tell
what's fine and what isn't?

250
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,783
-Thankfully, I spotted it beforehand.
-I got a call.

251
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,662
Do you know what would've happened
if you administered that much?

252
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,750
You're forbidden from prescribing
on your own without asking someone first.

253
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,710
Make sure to ask
before making proper prescriptions.

254
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,295
Understood?

255
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,755
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,508
I'll ask before I make a prescription.

257
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,987
Don't be so harsh
on a first-year resident.

258
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,655
She's still recovering.
Don't you feel bad?

259
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,824
Then she shouldn't have come here.

260
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,660
It's better for her to quit
than to inconvenience others.

261
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,162
Hold on.

262
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,872
She patted your bottom last time, right?

263
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:26,957
Isn't that sexual harassment?

264
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,626
I should report her
to the disciplinary committee.

265
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,379
She just did that
because I was like a son to her.

266
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,131
Don't be ridiculous.

267
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,674
Hey.

268
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,718
That's one of the excuses

269
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,470
old men use
after sexually harassing young girls.

270
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,306
Don't be ludicrous.

271
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,016
I get it.

272
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,642
At least talk nicely.

273
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,644
Imagine what she'll think of you.

274
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,770
Who cares--

275
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:50,939
Look at you.

276
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,609
You never talked back to me.

277
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,486
I mean, it'll taint
our department's reputation.

278
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,821
And I don't like seeing you

279
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,366
acting so cold toward someone
who's old enough to be your mother.

280
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,701
Then she should do better.

281
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,786
Then I'll be nice.

282
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,829
And if she doesn't?

283
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,914
Then I'll be ruthless.

284
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,625
No one is good from the start.

285
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,709
I was.

286
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,272
Mom.

287
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,409
Don't be too upset.

288
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,080
She never shows mercy to anyone.

289
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,584
I get it.

290
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,130
I deserved to be scolded for my mistake.

291
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,883
I understand why she was mad.

292
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,303
I get that she's merciless, but still.

293
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,223
How could she be so harsh to someone
who's old enough to be her mother?

294
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,768
She called me ignorant. My goodness.

295
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,437
Jeez.

296
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,899
With that personality of hers,
she'll never become a great doctor.

297
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,151
Don't get too close to her.

298
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,154
Even though I'm sure you won't.

299
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,239
Right.

300
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,701
How dare she eat all your gimbap?

301
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,249
Jung-min, my neck is killing me.

302
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,876
Can you massage it?

303
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,962
Where?

304
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,632
-Where?
-Your grandmother is just…

305
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,093
It hurts. Here.

306
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,887
-Here?
-Yes.

307
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,390
Don't feel too hurt.

308
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,811
Will this raise
the area around my eyes too much?

309
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,938
I'm skilled at what I do, ma'am.

310
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,191
I'll only add a bit, so it'll be fine.

311
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,652
I'll put some between your eyebrows too.

312
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,820
Okay.

313
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,289
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

314
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,417
Hello, Ms. Oh.

315
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,961
Goodness, hello.

316
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,338
What brings you here?

317
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,089
Hello, ma'am.

318
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,674
Hey, it's been a while.

319
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,302
I'm a regular here.

320
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,345
I see.

321
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,972
I guess you're here for some botox.

322
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,225
I thought you preferred
maintaining your natural beauty.

323
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,853
I guess you had a change of heart.

324
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,731
Goodness.

325
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,816
I guess you didn't hear.

326
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,319
Jung-min, my eldest grandson,

327
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:46,073
said he'd pay for botox shots
as my birthday gift.

328
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,325
I refused out of embarrassment,

329
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,079
but I had no choice
because he had already made a reservation.

330
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,121
Right.

331
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,833
Jung-min is quite considerate.

332
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,461
I'll leave you to it then.

333
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,545
Okay.

334
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,380
-See you later, ma'am.
- Okay.

335
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,302
Hey.

336
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,013
How could you book me
around the same time as her?

337
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,183
The nurses don't know that you're in-laws.

338
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,727
This is unbelievable.

339
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,897
Ms. Oh, that was some quick thinking.

340
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,567
How did you instantly
come up with such a lie?

341
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,112
Jeong-suk is smart all thanks to me.

342
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,115
By the way,

343
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,783
Mi-hee.

344
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,994
I want to ask you something.

345
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,708
Jung-min, that brat.

346
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,755
All he did on my birthday was pass me
the money Jeong-suk had given him.

347
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,007
It's true they're never grateful
for your babysitting.

348
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,551
Hello.

349
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,679
-Hello.
-I'll be treating you today.

350
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,763
Okay.

351
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,106
It does look suspicious.

352
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,609
I only knew about it after someone
at the bathhouse pointed it out.

353
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,904
It neither looked like
an age spot nor a mole.

354
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,782
I was worried, so I came here.

355
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,450
Ms. Oh.

356
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,412
I'll write you a referral

357
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,915
so you should go
and get a biopsy done at a hospital.

358
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,834
What's wrong?

359
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,461
Do you think it's skin cancer?

360
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,504
Of course not.

361
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,507
That's very unlikely.

362
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,635
But it's always better to be sure
and check just in case.

363
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,388
Right.

364
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,432
Keep this a secret from Jeong-suk.

365
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,976
She already has a lot on her plate.

366
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,561
Yes, ma'am.

367
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,898
But promise me
you'll get that checked out.

368
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,358
Jeez.

369
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,247
Why is she saying
I should go to a hospital?

370
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,584
-You're a bit late.
-Yes, I am.

371
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,336
Please get in.

372
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,509
What's going on between those two?

373
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,434
Are they dating?

374
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,148
What's all this?

375
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,193
It's a small token of my gratitude
for the amazing ride last night.

376
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,280
It's nothing. I was just going
to put it here and leave.

377
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,117
We should share this.

378
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,702
How about we go
and eat this at the cafeteria?

379
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,456
I could eat right now.

380
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,584
I just need to remove the catheter
from one of the patients.

381
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,211
-I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

382
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,026
Your food is safe.

383
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,861
Thank you.

384
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,165
He's the new chief of the Hepatobiliary
and Pancreas Department.

385
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,834
-Is that so?
-Yes.

386
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,420
I thought he was a celebrity at first.

387
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,005
He's from the US.

388
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,756
I heard he's single.

389
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,968
He may be single,
but I bet he's doing plenty of mingling.

390
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,720
Exactly.

391
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,268
-I'm sorry for being late.
-That's okay.

392
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,813
It looks delicious.

393
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,773
I can't guarantee the taste.

394
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,358
I'm sure it'll be good.

395
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,193
Let me open that for you.

396
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,660
-I added vegetables so it'll be healthier.
-Is that so?

397
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,870
Please enjoy your food.

398
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,290
Professor?

399
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,045
I've been feeling unwell today.

400
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,171
You can eat without me.

401
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,767
What the heck am I doing right now?

402
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,186
It'll be quick.

403
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,358
Gosh.

404
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,026
One minute.

405
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,988
You can wrap it up from here.

406
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,865
-Hello?
-Hey, Jung-min.

407
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,617
Can you help me remove the PCD?

408
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,285
Can I just take it out?

409
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,958
-Good work.
-Thank you.

410
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,753
-Hey, Mom.
-Jung-min.

411
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,254
Can you help me insert the central line?

412
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,714
I've never done it before.

413
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,758
Hello?

414
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,385
How do I explain the surgery?

415
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,845
It's a LAR. What was it again?

416
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,014
Hello?

417
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,267
The doctor told me to insert
a silastic drain into the wound.

418
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,480
How do I do it?

419
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,941
Hello?

420
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,610
-Hello?
-Jung-min.

421
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,028
Jung-min. I can't remember.

422
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,321
Tell me. Come here quickly.

423
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,823
-Hello?
-Gosh.

424
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,324
And you call yourself a doctor?

425
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,493
Why aren't you sending her
to the operating room?

426
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,829
-Sir.
-The patient needs surgery now!

427
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,996
-Look--
-When are you going to operate?

428
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,043
Gosh, my neck.

429
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:36,881
Hi, Jung-min.

430
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,718
Enough is enough.
You've really crossed the line.

431
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,887
What?

432
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,098
I thought you were smart
back in med school.

433
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,933
You scored 49 points
on the resident exams.

434
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,394
So how do you not know anything?

435
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,106
Come on. I had a long break in between.

436
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,733
If you had a long break,

437
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,318
you should've studied
by watching online videos in the meantime.

438
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,488
I'm always scolded
for not knowing any better.

439
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,574
I don't need you bothering me too.

440
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,411
Why did you have
to come to our department?

441
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,205
Hey!

442
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,040
I can't believe you.

443
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,544
I carried you in my womb for ten months

444
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,129
and put my life on the line
to give birth to you.

445
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,505
I cleaned after you.

446
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,801
I taught you how to talk and count,
and raised you until now.

447
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,845
So how dare you complain
and look down on me

448
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,889
just because I asked you for some help?

449
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,056
How could you?

450
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,768
Look, Mom.

451
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,227
That's not what I meant. I was--

452
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,771
"Mom"?

453
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,813
"Mom"?

454
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,149
I thought you wanted
to keep that a secret?

455
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,944
You can take
my night duty tonight, you jerk.

456
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,489
I'm already on night duty tonight.

457
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,907
I don't want to hear it!

458
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,533
Darn it.

459
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,368
Mom.

460
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,876
That wasn't what I meant.

461
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,263
MY SON

462
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:13,436
MOM, CHECK OUT THIS VIDEO

463
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,982
TIP 2. POSITIVE PRESSURE
I WILL DEMONSTRATE WITH A DISTAL LUMEN

464
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,359
My gosh.

465
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,821
TO SHOW YOU HOW
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE WORKS

466
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,949
This is a whole new world.

467
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,911
He should've sent this to me sooner.

468
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,008
A 68-year-old female patient.

469
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,928
The primary cancer
is in her ascending colon,

470
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,263
and it's quite large.

471
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,725
The cancer cells have metastasized
to her liver as well.

472
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,270
The lung CT scan shows that
they've metastasized

473
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,522
to two areas on the right lung
and one area on the left lung.

474
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:01,985
They've also metastasized to her spine,
so surgery won't be an option.

475
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,989
She should receive chemotherapy
as soon as possible.

476
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,156
-Chief Resident Hwang.
-Yes, sir.

477
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,534
Contact the Oncology Department
for a consultation.

478
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,702
Yes, sir.

479
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,416
-But what crime did she commit?
-Murder, sir.

480
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,086
She received a life sentence
for poisoning her husband.

481
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,673
Who's in charge of her?

482
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,885
It's me, sir.

483
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,475
I heard she's refusing treatment.
Can you persuade her?

484
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,768
I'll do my best.

485
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,605
That's a given.

486
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,648
What's important is the result.

487
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,698
Ma'am.

488
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:53,202
Your will to live matters the most
when it comes to receiving treatment.

489
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,331
If you continue to refuse treatment,

490
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,751
the pain will gradually worsen.

491
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,922
And you won't be able to live as long.

492
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,842
I understand that you feel hopeless.

493
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,805
But there have been patients
who survived even worse conditions

494
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,808
and lived for years.

495
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,319
This is the VIP ward.
The patient is very agitated.

496
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,820
-Call the director!
-Please hurry.

497
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,198
What is this?

498
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,575
-Jeez!
-It's a complete mess here.

499
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,785
Can you still not reach them?

500
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,119
-No, I can't.
-Darn it!

501
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,581
Darn it!

502
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,961
Yes, I'm glad you're here.

503
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,089
I should've known
how lousy this hospital was

504
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,549
the moment they sent
this rookie resident over.

505
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:53,554
One of your professors
told me something ludicrous today.

506
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,014
A colostomy?

507
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,767
I was told I'll have to live
with a bag attached to me from now on.

508
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,229
That's correct.
We'll have to do the surgery to be sure,

509
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,523
-but it's highly likely that--
-Darn it!

510
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,362
Are you telling me
to carry around a poop bag?

511
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,489
Do you have any idea how much money
I've spent on this hospital?

512
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,282
How dare you say that?

513
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,659
Get out!

514
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,995
Bring me the director of this hospital
this instant!

515
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,372
Please calm down--

516
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:23,292
Shut up! How dare you order me around?

517
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,421
Bring me the director this instant!

518
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,839
Sir.

519
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,174
This isn't an issue you can solve
by calling the director over.

520
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,718
You can't--

521
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,733
Darn it.

522
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,664
I'm sorry.

523
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,845
PATIENT: OH CHANG-GYU

524
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,394
This is Cha Jeong-suk.

525
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,314
Me?

526
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,151
I've never done it before, but…

527
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,656
Okay. I'll do it.

528
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,517
Please bring me the portable X-ray.

529
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,518
Yes, ma'am.

530
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,483
Hello, Doctor.

531
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,027
I'm Dr. Cha Jeong-suk who's on night duty.

532
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,614
I inserted a C-line,

533
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,408
and the X-ray shows a pneumothorax.

534
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,452
I think we need to insert a chest tube,

535
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,621
but I have no experience with it yet.

536
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,831
DOCTOR IM SEON-U

537
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,458
Hello, is this Dr. Im Seon-u
of the CS Department?

538
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,169
I see. You're doing emergency surgery.

539
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,379
Darn it.

540
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,679
-Sir, are you a second-year resident?
-Yes.

541
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,348
I inserted a C-line and took an X-ray.

542
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,016
I confirmed a pneumothorax.

543
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,478
Could you insert a chest tube for me?

544
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,648
I'm sorry, but I don't have
much experience with that yet.

545
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,110
Why did you do it instead of asking
someone more experienced to handle it?

546
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,529
All of them were busy.

547
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,739
No one from the CS Department
is available.

548
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,657
What should I do?

549
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,492
I--

550
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,049
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

551
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,682
What is it?

552
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,226
I'm at the ER right now.

553
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,603
Can you come here?

554
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,355
What happened?

555
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,400
I don't know how to insert a chest tube.

556
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,530
Is that why you called me?

557
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,950
It's not even worth answering,
so I'm hanging up.

558
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,705
You shamelessly lied
that your husband is dead,

559
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,165
yet you want a favor?

560
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,751
You should call a more experienced
resident for something like this.

561
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,961
I did, but no one--

562
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,673
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

563
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,305
RESIDENT CHA JEONG-SUK

564
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,098
Hello?

565
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:10,186
Dr. Jeon, this is Cha Jeong-suk.
I need your help with something.

566
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,979
Don't you know I just clocked out?

567
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,522
I know. I'm really sorry.

568
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,859
It's just that I don't know
how to insert a chest tube.

569
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,860
Hold on.

570
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,445
I spotted a pneumothorax--

571
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,155
I'll be there, so wait!

572
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,409
Thank you.

573
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,689
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

574
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,488
What is it now?

575
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,573
Honey.

576
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,080
I mean, hello?

577
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,541
-Hello?
-What is it?

578
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,713
I'm afraid you'll have to come.

579
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,715
The patient's condition is worsening.

580
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,675
Are you insane?

581
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,928
What would the others think
if I showed up there

582
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,055
just because you called?

583
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,898
Who cares about that
when the patient can't breathe?

584
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,191
If you don't come,

585
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:43,529
I will expose our relationship
to everyone in the hospital.

586
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:45,990
How ridiculous.

587
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:47,950
What did you say?

588
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,786
Dr. Seo, over here.

589
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,079
Hurry!

590
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,582
Hurry!

591
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,421
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

592
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,347
Is it not working?

593
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,309
You can't do it?

594
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,187
-Why isn't it working?
-Be quiet already!

595
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,482
I don't know if it's in or not.

596
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,734
It's about 3cm in, right?

597
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,446
Why are you having trouble with this?
You're a professor.

598
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,864
It's been ten years!

599
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,576
I'm not someone
who has time to do things like this.

600
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,666
Dr. Jeon!

601
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,087
Professor?

602
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,547
Why are you here?

603
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,428
-Let me.
-No.

604
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,722
I'm almost done.

605
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,726
All right.

606
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,396
Let me see how good you are.

607
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,985
Wrap it up.

608
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,654
Yes, sir.

609
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,337
Please prepare the suture.

610
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,555
-Connect the chest drainage bottle.
-Yes, ma'am.

611
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,601
Sir.

612
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,353
Can you hear me?

613
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,771
Can you try to cough?

614
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,567
Well done.

615
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,822
Now that he's okay, I should get going.

616
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,782
Dress him well.

617
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,576
I'll leave you to it.

618
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,122
Thank you, sir.

619
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,082
My pleasure.

620
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,045
-Get the dressing ready.
-Okay.

621
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,680
He came here
because of that first-year resident.

622
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,182
What's gotten into him?

623
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,393
When that resident was
speaking to him on the phone,

624
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,312
she said, "Honey."

625
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,773
I heard them talking as I passed by,
and they were talking casually.

626
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,109
But I heard she's a widow.
Is something going on between them?

627
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,823
Aren't you…

628
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,619
scared of me?

629
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,293
I'm sure you heard
about what crime I committed.

630
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,795
Yes.

631
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,755
I'm aware.

632
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,926
Then you should tend
to other patients instead.

633
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,762
I want to stay here quietly

634
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,014
and just vanish into thin air.

635
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,810
So use your valuable skills

636
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,438
on those who deserve to live.

637
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,405
Yes. I'm sorry.

638
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,907
We tried to dissuade him but…

639
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,704
Okay. I'm sorry.

640
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,929
Chairman Oh, I see you're having
a late-night snack.

641
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,556
Isn't it obvious?

642
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,357
I guess you've made up your mind, right?

643
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,694
Then when should we schedule your surgery?

644
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,488
Surgery, my foot.

645
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,782
Are you not going to get it?

646
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,077
Do you expect me to get it
after what you guys told me?

647
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,538
How dare you incompetent people
tell me what to do?

648
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,790
I'm going to rest here for a few days

649
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,252
then get treated at the biggest hospital
in the US at all costs!

650
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,716
Chairman Oh.

651
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,304
Our hospital is among the world's best
when it comes to this department.

652
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,805
There's no guarantee

653
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,225
that the hospitals there
will give you better treatment.

654
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,269
I don't want to hear it, so leave.

655
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,854
Raise the volume.

656
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:09,897
Yes, sir.

657
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,417
Hello, Professor.

658
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,086
-Hello.
-You're still here.

659
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,505
I'm checking on my patients.

660
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,090
Aren't you off work tomorrow?

661
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,591
-Yes.
-What do you have in mind?

662
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,259
Spending time with my family.

663
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,345
I've been neglecting them these days.

664
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,140
What will you be up to tomorrow?

665
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,060
I'm going to look for someone.

666
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,645
Who?

667
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,356
Me.

668
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,070
How's work?

669
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,951
Some of my patients refuse
to receive treatment.

670
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,454
They all have different reasons.

671
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,083
Even the most competent doctors won't be
able to do anything in such a situation.

672
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,838
So I have absolutely no idea
how to persuade them.

673
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,467
Others may not be able to do it,

674
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,095
but maybe you can.

675
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,057
Persuasion is
about striking a chord with them.

676
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,893
And I think that's your forte

677
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,771
when compared with other doctors.

678
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,942
How would you know?

679
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,902
Find out for yourself

680
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,238
by talking to them.

681
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,754
DREAM VILLAGE ANGEL HAVEN

682
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,525
Here it is.

683
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,448
CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION CARD
NAME: KIM U-HYEON

684
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,710
SMALLER THAN OTHERS HIS AGE,
BUT NOT SHORT

685
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,755
Was I abandoned?

686
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,591
No one knows the answer to that question.

687
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,219
But I hope that's not the case.

688
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,597
That's why we record these

689
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,892
as "found," not "abandoned."

690
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,770
"Found."

691
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,812
Right.

692
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,565
Have you registered your DNA
at the police station?

693
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,456
Your wife must be close

694
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,667
to the new chief of the Hepatobiliary
and Pancreas Department?

695
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,545
He's the doctor
who carried out her liver transplant.

696
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,380
I see.

697
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,131
But how did you know they were close?

698
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,217
They were eating together
at the cafeteria.

699
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,843
Everyone is talking

700
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,971
about how he's rich, handsome, and single.

701
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:33,767
Do women seriously think
that he's handsome?

702
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,726
Are you joking?

703
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,813
Objectively, he's far from ugly.

704
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,570
You'll have to add a penalty stroke.

705
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,031
Is this cracked?
Why are things so off recently?

706
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,672
What are you up to?

707
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,173
There's nothing much to see.

708
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,258
Let's eat.

709
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,342
Okay.

710
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,178
Enjoy.

711
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,014
I can't guarantee the taste.

712
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,391
Don't worry. It's good.

713
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,893
Lucky you.
You get to eat her food every day.

714
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,521
That's not true.
She hasn't cooked for me in ages.

715
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,440
She's so busy nowadays.

716
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:22,983
Right.

717
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,402
Mom, her mom is a doctor too.

718
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,030
Really? Which department?

719
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,574
Family Medicine.

720
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,035
Goodness. No way.

721
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,287
That's so fascinating.

722
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,123
I'm currently being trained
in that department too.

723
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,959
So tell me. Where does she work?

724
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,211
Did she open her own practice?

725
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,505
Mom.

726
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,633
Enough with the interrogation.

727
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:49,885
Where's Dad?

728
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,470
Indoor golfing.

729
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,514
I hear indoor golf centers are
the hottest place for affairs.

730
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,476
Hey, what are you talking about?

731
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,478
Just eat.

732
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,563
This is so good.

733
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,607
I'm glad. Eat up.

734
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,608
Eat up.

735
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,817
Okay.

736
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,874
DO NOT LET GO OF THE CATHETER
UNTIL THE PROCEDURE IS DONE

737
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,085
Thank you for the meal.

738
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,170
-Thank you for the meal.
-Okay. You can go upstairs.

739
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,883
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

740
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,905
Let's go.

741
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,667
Where are you going? Go up.

742
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,509
Hello, sir. Are you off today?

743
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,594
-The surgery was canceled.
-I see.

744
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,853
Why would they come
all the way here to golf?

745
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,980
We're here, aren't we?

746
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,774
How long must we do this in hiding?

747
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,443
I'm sick and tired of this.

748
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,528
Wait…

749
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,228
A bracelet?

750
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,397
AVICHEN 24K DIAMOND BRACELET

751
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,734
And it was 5,820,000 won?

752
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,364
This is a designer brand.

753
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,953
-Mother.
-Yes?

754
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:25,707
Did you recently purchase a bracelet?

755
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,502
Gosh, no.

756
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,420
I didn't.

757
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,422
I see.

758
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,055
AVICHEN 24K DIAMOND BRACELET

759
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,015
It's pretty.

760
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,311
But why did he buy this?

761
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,289
-Did you just come home?
-Yes.

762
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,333
How was golf?

763
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:09,960
It was so-so.

764
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,087
Honey,

765
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,548
did you buy a bracelet?

766
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,095
A bracelet?

767
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:21,972
Why are you so surprised?

768
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,226
I found this in your pocket.

769
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,521
It was pretty expensive.
Why did you buy it?

770
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,610
It's strange…

771
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,904
how you're not answering me.

772
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,449
Why would you look inside my pockets?

773
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:45,036
I checked them before taking the clothes
to the dry cleaners.

774
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,295
You really are a buzzkill, you know that?

775
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,590
It's your birthday soon.

776
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,008
My birthday?

777
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,719
It'll be in two months.

778
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,430
I was going to brag
about getting your gift early.

779
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,473
Gosh, you ruined everything.

780
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:07,767
Seriously?

781
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,728
Then did you think it was for me?

782
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,064
Well…

783
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,902
You've never bought me such things.

784
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,612
I know you like luxury items.

785
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,907
Did you forget how much you spent recently
at the department store?

786
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,285
It was just that one time.

787
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:27,787
If that's the case,

788
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,581
where is it?

789
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,210
Since I found out about it anyway,
can I just have it now?

790
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,420
No!

791
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,422
It's in my office.

792
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,341
Really?

793
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,303
I wanted to see it right now.
What a shame.

794
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,181
Honey.

795
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,310
You must be exhausted
after golfing, right?

796
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,520
Yes, I need to rest.

797
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,521
-Really?
-Yes.

798
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,523
Should I massage your shoulders?

799
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,943
They're so stiff.

800
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,194
That feels good.

801
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,570
This part.

802
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,572
It's okay. I just need to rest.

803
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,157
Shall I fill the bathtub?

804
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,451
I'd love that.

805
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,204
Okay. Come out in ten minutes.

806
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,288
Okay.

807
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,815
Can I come in?

808
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,900
You're already in.

809
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,661
It's been a while since you had wine
in the bathtub, right?

810
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,330
What's gotten into you
with all this treatment?

811
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,999
That's the power of gifts.

812
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,591
Drink slowly.

813
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,139
Do you think…

814
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,351
it's that easy for someone to change?

815
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,895
What do you mean?

816
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,814
You see,

817
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,360
I'm a dedicated mother
and wife to the bone.

818
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,154
You know me.

819
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,990
I'm the icon of selflessness and devotion.

820
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,700
Right.

821
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,204
I know I've changed
due to certain situations.

822
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,125
But my family is my top priority.

823
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,420
That'll never change.

824
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,802
Honey.

825
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,555
Why didn't you tell me about Seung-hi?

826
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,273
I knew you'd ask.

827
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:03,359
It's nothing good,
so I didn't bother to tell you.

828
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,779
Have you spoken with her?

829
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,031
We've just greeted each other.

830
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,325
Is she married?

831
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,534
Beats me.

832
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,500
Do you think she still hates me?

833
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,795
I doubt she loves you.

834
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,966
She's still as beautiful as she was then.

835
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:32,430
She looks so elegant
that she'd turn heads.

836
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:38,311
It feels like
I'm the only one who has aged.

837
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,069
You don't look too bad either.

838
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,447
Really?

839
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,032
Sure.

840
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,495
You're right.

841
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:59,374
I still got the body.

842
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,879
Don't stay in there for too long.

843
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:05,964
Okay.

844
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,069
Do you not like it, sir?

845
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,863
Would you like to see something else?

846
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:30,780
It's okay.

847
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:33,950
I'll take it.

848
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,327
How would you like to pay?

849
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,871
Twelve-month installments, please.

850
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,122
Yes, sir.

851
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,470
What brings you here?

852
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,932
I came to talk to you
about a personal matter.

853
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:02,604
So let me speak casually
to you for a moment.

854
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,274
What do you want?

855
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,406
I don't know…

856
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,367
how to begin.

857
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,287
To be honest,

858
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,247
I don't think

859
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,000
I've ever apologized to you.

860
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,545
I know it happened ages ago,

861
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,382
so bringing it up now…

862
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,928
may feel odd.

863
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,347
But still,

864
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:39,849
I'd like to apologize.

865
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:45,188
I won't justify my actions
and say I was immature back then.

866
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,398
I…

867
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,567
hurt you

868
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,737
very deeply.

869
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:54,989
I'm sorry.

870
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,535
I'm truly sorry.

871
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,745
I mean it.

872
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,875
I wanted to ask you
for forgiveness back then.

873
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,546
But I was a coward.

874
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,632
To be honest,

875
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,719
you were so amazing
and successful in my eyes

876
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,349
that I thought you'd just brush it off.

877
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,978
That was thoughtless of me.

878
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,897
How could you have forgiven me?

879
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,149
I'm sure…

880
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,235
you've had

881
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,946
your share of painful moments.

882
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,957
I don't even know how to respond to this.

883
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,168
That was ages ago.

884
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,169
I moved on.

885
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,879
There's no need to feel guilty.

886
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:56,050
If apologizing made
you feel better, I'm glad.

887
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:57,802
Really?

888
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,222
I'm relieved.

889
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,349
How have you been?

890
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,184
Are you married?

891
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,316
It's a bit absurd to hear you
trying to be friendly and ask questions.

892
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:15,069
Just because I don't
make an issue out of our past

893
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,697
doesn't mean we can be friends.

894
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:37,216
CHOI SEUNG-HI

895
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,011
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

896
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,388
-Did you page me?
-Yes.

897
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,223
It's about Mr. Oh Chang-gyu, our VIP.

898
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,018
He got discharged
and was about to get in his car

899
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,394
when he suddenly collapsed.

900
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,937
-He's here in the ER.
-What?

901
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,482
They're carrying out CPR in the ICU.

902
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,697
-Administer 1ml of epinephrine.
-Yes, ma'am.

903
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,823
Chairman Oh.

904
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,411
What are you doing?
Prepare the defibrillator.

905
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,537
Yes, ma'am.

906
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,047
Let me check his readings.

907
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,425
I'm seeing V-fib. Let's shock him now.

908
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,635
Charge it to 150J.

909
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:25,723
150J, charged.

910
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,309
Stand clear.

911
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,852
One, two, administering shock.

912
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,235
Once more. 150J.

913
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,655
I charged it to 150J.

914
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:43,116
Stand clear.
One, two, administering shock.

915
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,207
Administer 300ml of amiodarone.

916
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,875
-Yes, ma'am.
-Charge it to 200J.

917
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,544
One, two, administering shock.

918
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,390
-Did you administer the amiodarone?
-Yes, I did.

919
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:20,111
No.

920
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,813
Charge it to 200J.

921
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:57,982
Charge it to 200J.

922
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,234
-I'll take over.
-Okay.

923
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,489
I charged it to 200J.

924
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,534
Move. One…

925
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,539
Two…

926
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,083
Administering shock.

927
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:38,523
Dr. Cha.

928
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,858
Dr. Cha!

929
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,735
Open your eyes!

930
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,778
Dr. Cha!

931
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,162
DOCTOR CHA

932
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,936
Does that lady have some kind
of irresistible charm I don't know about?

933
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,604
Why do men swarm around her?

934
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,147
You didn't hear?

935
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:23,401
They say Dr. Cha and GS Professor Seo
are seeing each other.

936
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,944
Honestly, this is driving me crazy too!

937
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,072
Ms. Jang Hae-nam disappeared.

938
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:28,990
Are you out of your mind?

939
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,659
How dare an incompetent resident
like you humiliate our hospital?

940
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,578
Do you think you can continue to work?

941
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:37,832
I'm afraid I'll have to quit
working at the hospital.

942
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:42,461
