DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,887
Something's wrong,

3
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,638
isn't it?

4
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,308
Yes.

5
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,518
Something's wrong

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,854
but I can't even believe it

7
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,690
because it feels too unreal.

8
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,196
I think I know what it is.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,156
No.

10
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,909
You really don't know.

11
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,495
I think I know what it is!

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,879
You want to kill those two bastards.

13
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,940
Professor Seo is cheating on you!

14
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,905
It's raining!

15
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,741
Hurry up and close it.

16
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,701
My goodness!

17
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,662
-Why isn't it working?
-Hurry up!

18
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,746
I'm trying!

19
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,790
You can't even close
the roof of your own car?

20
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,416
I opened it for the first time today!

21
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,087
What do we do?

22
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,588
It's cold!

23
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,716
My goodness!

24
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,644
This isn't the time to be laughing!

25
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,857
It's cold!

26
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,411
Come on, stop laughing!

27
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,660
How badly did you two fight
to end up like this?

28
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,039
How will you even draw in this state?
Your entrance exams are around the corner!

29
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,086
-What?
-You said you're done letting off steam!

30
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,505
You should've just ignored her,
not fought her!

31
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,549
Are you saying I should've held back
when she grabbed my hair?

32
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,051
What?

33
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,427
Why should I move academies?

34
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,638
She keeps telling me to move!

35
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,932
That brat is treating me
like I'm some home-wrecker too!

36
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,733
I'm leaving for the day.

37
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,443
-Goodbye.
-Great work today.

38
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,527
Goodbye.

39
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,576
I-rang.

40
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,083
EPISODE 11

41
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,209
Honestly.

42
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,170
Thankfully, I don't think it'll scar.

43
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,048
Are you hurt anywhere else?

44
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,928
What on earth happened?

45
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,765
Are you getting bullied in school
or something?

46
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,978
You and your friends will be adults soon.
They should know better.

47
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,729
Why would they do this to you?

48
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,022
Who did this to you?

49
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,775
-Auntie Mi-hee.
-Yes.

50
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,070
I feel so bad for my mom.

51
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,947
Your mom?

52
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,077
MI-HEE:
I-RANG CAME TO VISIT MY CLINIC…

53
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,042
MI-HEE:
I-RANG CAME TO VISIT MY CLINIC

54
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:58,256
I'M GOING TO TAKE HER HOME, SO DON'T WORRY

55
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,511
Who is it?

56
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,061
There's non-alcoholic beer too.

57
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,065
On my grandma's birthday,

58
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,236
my family got together for dinner.

59
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,238
It was at a hotel.

60
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,242
And I coincidentally saw
Professor Seo there.

61
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,455
I saw who the other woman was too.

62
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,298
When I was in middle school,

63
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,093
my father did the same thing.

64
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,556
My mother had depression
after that happened.

65
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,267
She suffered for more than ten years.

66
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,228
So I kind of know how you feel.

67
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,733
Something like this can be so destructive…

68
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,986
that it can ruin someone.

69
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,908
How was it for you?

70
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,951
Did you wish that

71
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,121
your mother and father would get divorced?

72
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,831
At the time,

73
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,252
I thought Mom's hatred toward Dad
was what kept her going.

74
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,839
If they got divorced,

75
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,510
I thought my mom would lose the only thing
that gave her the will to live.

76
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:26,928
So I told my dad…

77
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,972
that if he divorced my mom,

78
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,810
I would throw myself from the roof.

79
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,978
I threatened him.

80
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,737
I know you keep to yourself.

81
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,033
So thank you for trying

82
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,452
to comfort me.

83
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,788
I'm not trying to comfort you.

84
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,416
It's just…

85
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,752
these things happen.

86
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,256
More often than we think.

87
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,009
Try to get some sleep.

88
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,806
Thank you for the drive today.

89
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,683
Sure.

90
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,979
Actually…

91
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,442
I have something to confess.

92
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,404
The two of you.

93
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,697
Jung-min.

94
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,283
I know that you're dating

95
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,327
my son.

96
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,538
From the looks of it,

97
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,875
you two suit each other.

COLON AND RECTAL SURGERY SPECIALIST
SEO IN-HO

99
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,174
OUT OF OFFICE

100
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,085
-Please check the consultation request.
-Okay.

101
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,862
Do you think you can work today?

102
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,781
I have to.

103
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,577
Working is the only thing
I can do right now.

104
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,843
-You see this, right?
-Yes.

105
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,054
This part seems to be causing the issue.

106
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,892
-You said she draws right?
-Yes.

107
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,978
Even when she gets out of the cast,
her arm's range of motion can be limited.

108
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,981
And her wrist might not move
the way she wants.

109
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,693
It'll take around three to six months

110
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,362
for the nerves to recover.

111
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,055
How would you know that
when you raised your kids in comfort?

112
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,599
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Seung-hi working at our hospital.

113
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,062
But I already explained
why I didn't tell you.

114
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,232
And I also just learned that I-rang
and Seung-hi's daughter are friends.

115
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,235
Could you tell me
where you bought that bracelet?

116
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,655
My husband bought it for me,
so I don't know where he got it.

117
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,269
-Where is Choi Seung-hi right now?
-Sorry?

118
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,273
She'll be in the seminar room.
All the professors today…

119
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,110
Didn't she just address her by name only?

120
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,488
I think she said, "Where's Choi Seung-hi?"

121
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,198
Come on, no way.

122
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,121
Any updates on the academic research fund
that we applied for?

123
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,041
We plan to apply for a collaborative
multidisciplinary team study.

124
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,876
So we are preparing a joint research plan

125
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,794
with the infectious diseases
and pulmonology departments.

126
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,506
We'll need to schedule regular meetings.

127
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,383
Sure. Meetings are one thing.

128
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,345
But please share the progress via email…

129
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,933
Yes, what is it?

130
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,017
Professor Choi.

131
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,645
I need a word with you.

132
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,441
If it's not urgent, let's talk later.
I'm in the middle of--

133
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,651
It's urgent.

134
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,403
Or shall we talk here?

135
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,789
-What is it?
-Let's go to your office.

136
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,259
Tell him to come.

137
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,011
Seo In-ho.

138
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,556
Did you not hear me?

139
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,848
Tell Seo In-ho

140
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,559
to come here.

141
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,102
Right this instant.

142
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,610
Call him.

143
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,490
Hey.

144
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,618
I just finished an outpatient appointment.
I have some time.

145
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,622
To your office?

146
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,333
Don't ask and just come.
You'll know when you get here.

147
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,006
Come here right now.

148
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,341
Unless you want

149
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,305
the whole hospital to be talking about
your affair with Choi Seung-hi.

150
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,610
PROFESSOR'S OFFICE

151
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,049
FAMILY MEDICINE SPECIALIST CHOI SEUNG-HI
IN OFFICE

152
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,216
OUT OF OFFICE

153
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,695
-Honey.
-Shut up.

154
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,490
Confirm something for me.

155
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,992
I-rang's friend, Eun-seo.

156
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,537
Is your daughter

157
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,331
Seo In-ho's daughter?

158
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,874
Honey, the thing is…

159
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,751
That's right. She is In-ho's daughter.

160
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,715
We met coincidentally
at a hospital in Chicago

161
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,217
where In-ho and I trained.

162
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,428
Eun-seo was conceived then
and I gave birth to her.

163
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,972
But I didn't keep seeing her.

164
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,517
Three years ago, when Seung-hi came back
to Korea and came to this hospital,

165
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,185
we got close again…

166
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,564
Did you have no one
to share your love story with?

167
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,316
You two are taking turns talking

168
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,777
as if you're so eager
to get the next word in.

169
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,072
Sure, so the two of you

170
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:31,991
are in love?

171
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,370
I hope it lasts forever.

172
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,871
It's not that. The truth is…

173
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,001
-We already decided to break up…
-Who said we would?

174
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,379
I don't plan on breaking up.

175
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,343
Whether you two break up

176
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,346
or live together for years on end

177
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,849
has nothing to do with me anymore.

178
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,813
I restarted my residency after 20 years,
and I'm going to complete it.

179
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,606
As for you two,

180
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,693
don't disgrace me or my son.

181
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,530
And Choi Seung-hi.

182
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,365
Quit this hospital.

183
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,076
You have other hospitals you can go to.

184
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,828
Don't you come from a rich family?

185
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,500
I know that the two of you
have been doing all you can

186
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,377
to get me to quit.

187
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,631
Those cheap tricks
won't work anymore, so you quit.

188
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,842
You have a month.

189
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,218
Quit within a month

190
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,929
and get out of my sight.

191
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,683
And you, Seo In-ho!

192
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,020
You lie low and wait.

193
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,191
I'm still thinking about
what I should do with you.

194
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,542
When you said
we should take some time to think,

195
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,586
I thought you meant we should break up.

196
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,797
I guess that's what you wanted to hear.

197
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,841
I guess you were so desperate
for me to give up on you.

198
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,134
It's not that.

199
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,302
Then going forward…

200
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,472
Do we really need to break up?

201
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,600
I think you'll be a free man at last.

202
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,230
-A free man?
-Don't you think she'll divorce you soon?

203
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,805
This…

204
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,644
How much does I-rang know?

205
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,230
Tell me the truth!

206
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,232
She knows everything.

207
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,904
What about Jung-min?

208
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,532
-He knows.
-What?

209
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,908
Mother knows too.

210
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,002
Look what you've done.

211
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,880
And you dared
to act all high and mighty in front of me

212
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,173
after everything you've done?

213
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,759
My children are so pitiful
to have you as their father, you bastard!

214
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,136
Be quiet.

215
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,513
Why did you make a fool out of me
when the whole family already knew?

216
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,973
Why was I the only one who didn't know?

217
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,558
The kids didn't want you to know!

218
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:54,484
They didn't want you to be in shock
when you haven't fully recovered yet.

219
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,699
Live the rest of your life…

220
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,911
atoning to the kids.

221
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,206
You horrible bastard!

222
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,001
How could you do this?

223
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,921
How could you do this to our kids?

224
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,061
Dr. Kim, hello.

225
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,355
-You went to see your baby again?
-Yes.

226
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,024
It's a relief that both of you are safe.

227
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,194
I was really shocked when I heard
you had to give birth right away

228
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,111
due to amniorrhexis.

229
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,031
My baby was the one who pulled through.

230
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,575
She's recovering well
like her nickname "Little Miss Strong."

231
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,202
How admirable.

232
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,329
I heard you're being discharged.

233
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,789
Yes.

234
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,292
And my baby is going to be discharged
in about two weeks.

235
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,214
Are you really just going to leave
without getting treated?

236
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
Yes.

237
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,928
I'll go home,
and my mom will take care of me.

238
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,263
Once the baby comes home,

239
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,350
I'll feed it formula,
put it to sleep, and bathe it.

240
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,185
That's what I want to do.

241
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,562
I won't be able to do that
once I start treatment.

242
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,606
There's no hope anyway.

243
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,778
Be good to your mom.
Becoming a mom is hard.

244
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,581
I just visited the baby.

245
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,667
She's gotten chubbier since yesterday.

246
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,961
When I called out her nickname,

247
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,714
she looked at me as if she recognized--

248
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,340
I don't want to hear it. Stop.

249
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,051
No one is happy to see your baby.

250
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,803
Mom.

251
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,226
Stop hating my baby.

252
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,147
If I'm gone,
all she will have is you and Dad.

253
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,317
You and Dad will have to raise the baby.

254
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,776
You raise the baby.

255
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,404
You're responsible for your child, not me!

256
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,283
You should be the one to do everything
from her 100th-day celebration party

257
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,036
and her first birthday,
to taking her to her first day of school!

258
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,621
If you don't,
I don't want to see that kid.

259
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,709
Okay.

260
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,838
I'll do all of that, okay?

261
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,245
Yes, is this Seocho Police Station?

262
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,791
I want to find the family
I was separated from as a child.

263
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,880
How do I register my DNA?

264
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,061
Are you free after work?

265
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,983
That's new.

266
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,906
You've never once asked me
if I have time or if I want to meet first.

267
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:32,160
I'm the one who clings to you,
appeases you, and gets upset.

268
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,123
Even when I do that,
you meet me once every five times.

269
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,751
This doesn't seem like
a normal relationship.

270
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,044
Sure.

271
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,046
If that's what you think, it must be true.

272
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,842
Being stubborn is in your nature.
Why are you agreeing with me on this?

273
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,471
Shouldn't you be lecturing me about
how relationships can differ?

274
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,474
What's the point when things are ending?

275
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,726
But we should
at least end things properly.

276
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,895
We'll still be seeing each other.

277
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,273
I have something to tell you too.

278
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,899
Let's meet after work.

279
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,058
D&J
ART ACADEMY

280
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:40,979
-Seo I-rang.
-Mom!

281
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,150
Were you waiting long?

282
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,985
I didn't wait that long.

283
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,529
You were working so hard.

284
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,114
-You saw?
-Of course!

285
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,742
Let's eat something good.

286
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,452
-Great!
-Great!

287
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,090
Do you have something to say?

288
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,180
I…

289
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,766
-found out.
-About what?

290
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,434
About Dad.

291
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,397
And about your friend Eun-seo too.

292
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,490
It must've been so painful.

293
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,201
You couldn't even tell me.

294
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,287
It felt strange.

295
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,499
To find I have a sibling
other than Jung-min.

296
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,088
There is someone else
in this world who calls my dad "Dad."

297
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,716
And that person is Eun-seo.

298
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,636
I'm sorry

299
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,265
for making you worry about something
other kids don't have to go through.

300
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,476
Did you tell Jung-min?

301
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,727
That you know everything?

302
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,730
He is an adult,
so I'm not worried about him.

303
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,316
I'm grown up too, so don't worry about me.

304
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,236
And do what you want.

305
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,113
Whatever that may be, I don't care.

306
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,366
No, I'm okay with it.

307
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,663
I feel so reassured

308
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,582
to have you guys.

309
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,170
You should hurry up and eat.

310
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,047
I'll end up eating everything.

311
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,716
I'll eat.

312
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,051
Okay, is the tteokbokki good?

313
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,553
It's good.

314
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,232
Eun-seo, what's wrong?

315
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,234
How will I take the early admissions exam
with this arm?

316
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,444
There are regular admissions.

317
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,654
You won't be wearing the cast then.

318
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,615
You really know nothing.

319
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,908
For regular admissions,

320
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,745
you can only apply to either
Hanguk University or Hongin University.

321
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,121
Then just apply to one.

322
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,373
I never pressured you about college.

323
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,543
Seo I-rang can apply
to both universities, unlike me!

324
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,589
I can't even compete in early admissions,
and I can only apply to one school.

325
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,673
Eun-seo.

326
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,426
I'd rather die than
go to a less prestigious school than her!

327
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,722
I'll lose some of my touch
after being in a cast for two months.

328
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,724
What do I do?

329
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,355
It's okay.

330
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,357
You won't lose your touch.

331
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,900
You're…

332
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:33,943
going to do well.

333
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,613
Why do I have to get things taken away?

334
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,783
From Dad to opportunities.

335
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,160
Why is it always me?

336
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,384
Is there really a need
to meet like this to break up?

337
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,968
I have something to say.

338
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,387
Say it.

339
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,556
I found out that Professor Seo
is having an affair.

340
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:08,269
And I learned that Dr. Cha found out

341
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,397
about his affair.

342
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,527
It's embarrassing to have found out
all these fine details about your family,

343
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,278
but I thought I should let you know.

344
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,990
I thought you should know
if you didn't already.

345
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,034
Did you not know?

346
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,994
I knew about my father's affair.

347
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,291
But I didn't know that my mom knew.

348
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,295
-It must be hard for you.
-It's something I have to handle.

349
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,588
Are you done?

350
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,467
I'll go now.

351
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,891
Seo In-ho, that bastard.

352
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,393
He doesn't look like it,

353
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:35,273
but it seems like he has
incredibly strong instincts to reproduce.

354
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,027
If not, how can he maintain two families
and have a secret love child

355
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,779
in this day and age?

356
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,113
Sure.

357
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,116
Tell the whole world about
my husband maintaining two families.

358
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,869
What? Do you want me
to give you a loudspeaker?

359
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,580
What on earth do people see in him?

360
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,710
What gives him the right
to be loved by two great women?

361
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,463
Is Seo In-ho good in bed?

362
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,257
Jeez, honestly.

363
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,136
What? I need to know that
to explain this fiasco!

364
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,137
Hey!

365
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:12,018
Do you think I'd remember?
We slept in separate rooms for ten years.

366
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,771
Right, you're Candy.

367
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,776
So what are you going to do now?

368
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,945
What can I really do?

369
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,156
We'll fight and pester each other,

370
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,284
and in the end, we'll get divorced.

371
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,079
And who would benefit from that?

372
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,793
So?

373
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,878
What will you do now?

374
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,674
Are you going to live with Jeong-suk?

375
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,385
Or will you divorce her
and go to that woman?

376
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,719
Not in front of the kids.

377
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,722
We should be aware of your decision too.

378
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,976
So are you going to marry that woman?

379
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,853
Hey, don't say such nonsense.

380
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,563
You're really the worst.

381
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,859
It's better to give up on one side
and devote yourself to the other.

382
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,486
This is the worst thing to do to Mom
and that woman.

383
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,114
Unlike what you think,
it's not an easy decision.

384
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,033
You can't speak so recklessly about
grown-ups' matters.

385
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,910
So are you going to get divorced?

386
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,871
What are you going to do?

387
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,923
I…

388
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,844
don't want to get divorced.

389
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,893
Try to walk.

390
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,230
This is the first time
I walked out of a bar on my own

391
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,982
because I was embarrassed.

392
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,234
How did you never grow up?

393
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,111
You're the same as you were in college.

394
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:50,491
Fine, you're the mature one.
You're the true adult here. Happy?

395
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,409
I am!

396
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,369
-I'm tired.
-Sit.

397
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,663
Jeez, why did you drink so much?

398
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,294
Jeong-suk.

399
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:07,216
I'm surrounded by foolish men like that.

400
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,261
You would think
their wives would not be great, right?

401
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,598
But no, they're all decent.

402
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:18,603
Do you think those women aren't getting
a divorce because they have no pride?

403
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,980
They just live with it.

404
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,816
You live an exciting life on your own.

405
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,653
And you're telling me
not to get a divorce?

406
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,363
My life is lousy.

407
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,408
You just don't know how thankful
you should be for that lousy life.

408
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,035
Honestly,

409
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,204
if hell exists,

410
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,122
then that place

411
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,458
would be in here.

412
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,629
Anyway, I'm jealous of that too.

413
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,548
So just live your life.

414
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,425
You want me to keep living like this?

415
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,555
I bought you a plant in college
that cost 5,000 won.

416
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,267
You still managed to keep it healthy
even after 20 years.

417
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,062
You could never let go
of any relationship you have,

418
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,022
whether it be with a plant
or with an animal.

419
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,983
Do you think you can leave Seo In-ho?

420
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,110
Fine.

421
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,237
If that makes you happy,

422
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,781
I'll welcome that decision
with my arms and legs--

423
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,241
Hey!

424
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,410
-I'll do a shoulder dance too.
-Jeez, honestly.

425
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,372
Still…

426
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,750
regardless of everything,

427
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,004
if breaking up is the path
that will make you unhappy,

428
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,464
then you shouldn't do it, Jeong-suk.

429
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,925
Think long and hard about it.

430
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,472
No one will live your life for you.

431
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,811
You know me

432
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,064
better than I know myself.

433
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,394
Why do I have to quit the hospital?

434
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,439
I'll quit if you get a divorce.

435
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,317
Then you can finish your residency
without problems.

436
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,610
Are you telling me

437
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,570
to get a divorce?

438
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,410
Whether I get divorced or not,

439
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,038
what gives you the right to demand that?

440
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,206
"Right"?

441
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,083
Then what right do you have?

442
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,796
You're the one who stole my man,
got pregnant, and married him.

443
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,298
How dare you talk to me about rights?

444
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,134
You, out of all people!

445
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,970
If that hadn't happened,
this wouldn't have happened either!

446
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,347
Even when I was pregnant in the US,

447
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,266
I had no intention
of breaking up your family.

448
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,310
But come to think of it,
I was being arrogant.

449
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,063
I didn't want to seem pathetic,
so I pretended to be dignified.

450
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,982
But all that was pointless.

451
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,985
I should've shamelessly snatched him away.

452
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,736
Just like you did.

453
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,280
So your actions right now

454
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,615
are justified?

455
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,576
Sure, I'm not saying I did anything good.

456
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,245
But what should In-ho have done?

457
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,080
A one-night mistake resulted in a child.

458
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,167
He left me because you got pregnant.

459
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,586
Should he have left you
because I got pregnant?

460
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,547
Is that it?
Then you don't deserve redemption either.

461
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,257
You and I are basically the same.

462
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,342
So why am I the only immoral one here?

463
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,719
Why are you the only victim?

464
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,138
I am a victim and so is my daughter!

465
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,975
My daughter is about to give up
going to college because of your daughter!

466
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,477
Are you satisfied now?

467
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,441
No.

468
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,818
Your daughter ending up like that

469
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,446
isn't enough to make me
feel satisfied in this situation.

470
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,491
But I do hope you realize one thing.

471
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,495
Your daughter's unhappiness
is the price of your actions.

472
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,665
Don't be bitter.

473
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:54,003
I'll consider this the price I'm paying
for my actions as well.

474
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,606
I guess you had emergency surgery.

475
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,651
A patient with panperitonitis
caused by a cancer obstruction came in,

476
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,446
so I did the Hartmann's procedure.
Thankfully, it went well.

477
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,365
-Keep up the good work.
-Thank you.

478
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:49,910
Professor Seo.

479
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,004
-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Is something wrong?

480
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,090
A short circuit must have
caused a fire in the dorms.

481
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,051
Thankfully, the security guard
discovered it early,

482
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,302
so it didn't spread much.

483
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,597
But the smoke is really bad.
It's like a tear gas chamber in there.

484
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,140
I see. I'll see you later.

485
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,601
Jeong-suk.

486
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,229
I have to go.

487
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,122
Jeong-suk.

488
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:33,722
Dr. Cha.

489
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,392
Dr. Cha, are you inside?

490
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,686
Dr. Cha, wake up!

491
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,564
Dr. Cha, wake up!

492
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:43,816
Dr. Cha!

493
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,776
Open the door right now!

494
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,409
Dr. Cha!

495
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,202
Dr. Cha!

496
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,918
We have to get out of here.

497
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,425
Let's hurry out.

498
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,801
Grab onto me.

499
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,581
Jeong-suk.

500
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,342
I'll be the one to carry my wife.

501
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,862
Let go. Put me down.

502
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,656
Put me down.

503
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,706
I'm fine, so go.

504
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,418
Why was that guy with you?

505
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,755
And why did you come?

506
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,799
What?

507
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,592
Did you think I hit Seung-hi or something?

508
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,095
Seung-hi came here?

509
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,681
Yes, she unleashed
her anger on me and left.

510
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,273
Seung-hi.

511
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,387
-Mom.
-Hey.

512
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:20,973
Thank you.

513
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,809
There's still a lot of smoke, right?

514
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,269
It's much better than before.

515
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,564
Hey, Mom.

516
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,483
I heard you know.

517
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,820
About what Father did.

518
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,782
Did Dr. Jeon tell you?

519
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,701
Yes.

520
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,996
Let's talk about that later.

521
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,498
I'm too weak to do it now.

522
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,127
It's okay.

523
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,464
I just need some time.

524
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,215
Mom, let's go to the ER together.

525
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,886
You inhaled a lot of smoke,
and you don't look well.

526
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,180
I got out quickly,
so I didn't inhale that much.

527
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:02,973
I just need to rest.

528
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,059
The dorms will be closed for three days.

529
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,769
They need to find out
what caused the fire.

530
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,063
I see.

531
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,523
Are you going to come home?

532
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,205
PROFESSOR ROY

533
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,416
I'm opening my place for free
to the residents

534
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,418
who lost a place to stay due to the fire.

535
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,629
It's a three-minute walk
from the hospital.

536
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,714
Unlimited bread and ramyeon
will be provided.

537
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,471
Dr. Cha, are you feeling all right?

538
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,555
I'm fine.

539
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,559
What are you doing here at this hour?

540
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,020
The night duty room
in our department is full.

541
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,148
I was going to check
if there was room here to sleep.

542
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,234
Did you not see the message?

543
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,444
Professor Roy opened up his place.

544
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,739
Still, how can I go there?

545
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,283
Where are you going to sleep and shower?

546
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,285
There's no room here.

547
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,329
But going there is a bit…

548
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,583
It might be awkward to go alone,

549
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,419
so let's go together.

550
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,379
I was wondering what to do if no one came

551
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,047
after sending out a message like that.

552
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,508
I sincerely welcome you both.

553
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,219
There are two empty rooms over that way.

554
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,637
You can each take one.

555
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,805
I'll wash up first.

556
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,058
The rooms are first come,
first served, right?

557
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,059
Of course.

558
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,483
How do you feel?

559
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,361
You looked quite unwell before.

560
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,697
I'm fine.

561
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,324
I guess I had a nightmare.

562
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,621
Do you want a cup of tea?

563
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,510
They are my parents.

564
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,263
So when you said you were adopted…

565
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,264
It's true.

566
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,315
They seem like good people.

567
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,360
That's right.

568
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,155
I was a very lucky case.

569
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,494
The truth is,
I'm trying to find my family here.

570
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,955
I'm going to register my DNA first.

571
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,584
You made a good decision.

572
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,422
You have to try once
so that you won't have any regrets.

573
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,925
I wish you the best of luck.

574
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,385
Thank you.

575
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,639
I'll head into my room now.

576
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:58,232
And thank you so much for today.

577
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,778
I wouldn't have been able
to escape without you.

578
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,766
Professor, this is your chance.

579
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,769
-What?
-You like Dr. Cha.

580
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,438
Me?

581
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,525
Did you really think
it wouldn't be obvious?

582
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:46,071
It does feel a bit immoral,
but this situation is an exception.

583
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,948
So I think it's fine.

584
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,866
Go for it.

585
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,661
You know that Professor Seo is cheating.

586
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,164
Well…

587
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,167
But…

588
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,460
Dr. Cha…

589
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,504
could forgive him.

590
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,300
She may be a very forgiving person,

591
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,260
but it'll be hard to forgive him.

592
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,178
He has a kid.

593
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:13,223
With the woman he's having an affair with.

594
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,818
Hello.

595
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,749
Tell your mom to come home.

596
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,043
The dorms are closing for a few days.

597
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,463
I did tell her to,
but she said she wasn't going to.

598
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,424
Then where is she sleeping?

599
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,552
She said she was staying
at Professor Roy's place.

600
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,511
What?

601
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:57,017
He opened up his place to any resident
who has no place to go.

602
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,645
I'm sure a lot of people went.

603
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,791
Okay, we'll move on
to the next item on the agenda.

604
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,834
What Professor Roy applied for--

605
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,961
Do you really need the devices you applied

606
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,588
for purchase approval?

607
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,756
Yes.

608
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,219
If someone asks you a question,

609
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,472
shouldn't you answer with an explanation?

610
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,809
It's difficult to perform a
major hepatectomy

611
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,394
with the laparoscopic instruments
we have now.

612
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:44,064
We need a laparoscopic system
with 4K image quality and 3D resolution.

613
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,984
And we need an ICG camera
to accurately check the resection margin

614
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,070
and to minimize bile duct injuries
as much as possible.

615
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,031
You're already using a laparoscope
with 3D resolution.

616
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,703
Perhaps you were not aware of this.

617
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,081
While it may not be an issue
for GI tract surgery,

618
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,792
it has its limits for surgery involving
the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.

619
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,169
And it has no real-time
ICG conversion capability.

620
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,588
I explained this all
during the last medical meeting

621
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,258
before I applied for approval,
so I find the way you're reacting now…

622
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,135
quite troublesome.

623
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,637
We bought the device only three years ago.

624
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,140
If you request a purchase approval
as soon as you come here,

625
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,308
what about the devices
for other departments?

626
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,270
You're putting the hospital director
and the planning director on the spot.

627
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,440
We have fewer patients, and the revenue
stays the same even if we get new ones.

628
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,733
They'll nag us!

629
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,027
Excuse me, I shall say a word.

630
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,613
This here--

631
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,824
That was before I came here.

632
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,702
Since I came to this hospital,
a lot of things should change.

633
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,080
And Professor Seo,
why are you worried about that?

634
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,957
Not even Chief Yoon is saying anything.

635
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,709
What?

636
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,174
Enough!

637
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,052
Why are you fighting like this
in a meeting?

638
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,347
As doctors,
you should be setting an example!

639
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,932
Yet you're glaring at each other!

640
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,643
I'm talking right now
and you're still glaring at each other!

641
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,919
I was out of line during the meeting.

642
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:30,879
I apologize.

643
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:35,050
You humiliated me publicly.

644
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,970
Yet you apologize
when there's no one else around.

645
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,558
I know that you don't get
the organizational culture

646
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,810
because you lived abroad.

647
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:48,063
But how could you be so rude
and two-faced?

648
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,699
You always look at me with contempt.
But don't get the wrong idea.

649
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,118
Are you that different from me?

650
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,246
At the very least…

651
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,834
I didn't covet something that wasn't mine.

652
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,710
How indecent.

653
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,059
Yes, honey.

654
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,770
You can tell me, honey.

655
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,607
It's okay, just tell me.

656
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,822
Hello? Professor Seo?

657
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,657
Yes, okay.

658
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,326
I said talk!

659
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,036
Right,

660
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,123
the guardian of the patient Park Gwi-nam,
who had surgery two days ago,

661
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,083
wants to see you no matter what.

662
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,751
What should I do?

663
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,754
Is it that difficult
to look into a patient who is in pain?

664
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,089
Surgery doesn't solve everything!

665
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,550
She's in pain
after you performed the surgery!

666
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,261
You should do something
so she's not in pain!

667
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,805
I understand that you're worried.

668
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:07,100
It's only been two days since her surgery,
so it's natural she's in pain.

669
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:11,605
So give her medicine.
She's going to die like this at her age!

670
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,816
We have already given her
as many painkillers as we can.

671
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,026
If we give her any more

672
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,653
and cause a delay
in discovering any new pains,

673
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,155
things may become dangerous.

674
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,492
You pretend as if you care.

675
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,747
My aunt also underwent surgery
for her colon cancer in another hospital.

676
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,875
But her pain was gone within a day
and she was able to walk around.

677
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:35,128
How dare you spew nonsense
after screwing up the surgery?

678
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,588
Damn it.

679
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,968
The surgery went well.

680
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,262
The level of pain
that she is experiencing is

681
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:48,099
all within the boundaries
explained in the consent form you signed.

682
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,809
If it gets worse,

683
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,063
we will find
an appropriate painkiller to administer.

684
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,532
What?

685
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,242
What happened?

686
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,869
She spat on him.

687
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:08,954
-What?
-She did what?

688
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:09,955
She spat on him.

689
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,331
-Spat?
-Really?

690
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,499
Who?

691
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,833
Oh, no.

692
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,251
What did you do this time?

693
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,462
-I just…
-No, hang on…

694
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,881
You bit me like a coward?

695
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,384
You pinched me like a coward?

696
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,595
-I pinched you because you bit me.
-I bit you because you pinched me.

697
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,764
I'll send you to the ICU.

698
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,519
What a disgrace to fight in the hospital.

699
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,437
You.

700
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,815
Consider yourself lucky
that you're still alive.

701
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,818
If you contact Bong-suk one more time,

702
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,861
all bets are off.

703
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,363
I told you already.

704
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,240
Bong-suk texted me first.

705
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,658
At least, today.

706
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:50,078
Whether it's a text or call,
don't answer it. Block her!

707
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,955
Don't order me around.
It's not your business!

708
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,416
You betrayed her to marry
into a rich household.

709
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,251
How dare you sway her?

710
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,794
You filthy bacteria.

711
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,462
Bacteria? You little…

712
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,259
You virus, how dare you meddle?

713
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,553
Why would you meddle in our ardent love?

714
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,179
You're not her father!

715
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,347
I'm practically like her father.

716
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,517
My father told me not to associate
with the likes of you on his deathbed.

717
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,145
Your father died when you were young,
before we even met.

718
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,230
I should sew your lips shut with a needle!

719
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,732
-I'll punch you! Three times!
-I'll do it two times!

720
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,192
-I'll do it four times! Six times!
-I'll do it five times!

721
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,486
Please be quiet!

722
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,952
This punk called me "bacteria."

723
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,497
I held back.
I was going to call you "cancer."

724
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,624
You punk, you're divorced with two kids.

725
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,960
My younger sister is still unwed,
so how dare you!

726
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,047
Calm down. You two being like this--

727
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,382
You two being like this
won't solve anything.

728
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,260
That's exactly what I was saying.

729
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,179
So…

730
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,306
Chief Yoon.

731
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,974
What will you do now?

732
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,603
If Bong-suk forgives me,

733
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,230
I want to start over with her.

734
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,733
Chief Lim.

735
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,610
If your younger sister forgives him,

736
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,153
it's fate, and all is well--

737
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,946
What do you mean by forgive?

738
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,908
Bong-suk told me
she's still thinking about it!

739
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,410
Things were going well
with the attorney she met!

740
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,122
Wouldn't you try to stop this?

741
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,959
If that person is precious to me,

742
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,253
I would.

743
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,924
I would cheer on her new love.

744
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,428
A man who betrays someone once
can betray them again.

745
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,847
-Right.
-Dr. Roy, you punk!

746
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,476
What will you do if Bong-suk forgives him?

747
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,521
Love…

748
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,773
lasts forever.

749
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,070
Doesn't love change?

750
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,739
It did so for you.

751
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,956
You're all ready.

752
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,043
Hello, you're here.
Dr. Roy dropped by too.

753
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,587
My patient is being discharged,
so I should come.

754
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,216
-Did you go see the baby today too?
-Yes.

755
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:09,926
She's so pretty.

756
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,137
How can I leave her here?

757
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,806
The baby may seem like an angel now,

758
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,183
but once you raise her,
it's harder than you think.

759
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,101
Right, ma'am?

760
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,940
But they say no mother regrets
giving birth to their child.

761
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,361
You're preparing
for her first birthday already?

762
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,572
-Yes.
-Jeez, don't even get me started.

763
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:34,784
She's already reserving the food
and trying to order the clothes.

764
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,370
Jeez, you're the epitome
of an overzealous mother.

765
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,580
She takes after you.

766
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:44,461
Dr. Seo, what item did you grab
on your first birthday?

767
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,421
Me?

768
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,093
I…

769
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,597
Dr. Seo

770
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,057
grabbed a pencil.

771
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,020
To tell you the truth, he's my son.

772
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,104
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

773
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,814
Really?

774
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,817
-What in the world?
-You look alike!

775
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,860
-We do, right?
-Yes.

776
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,237
He resembles his father.

777
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,739
I see.

778
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:17,243
-Then Dr. Seo, can I ask you for a favor?
-Sure.

779
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:21,206
I'm going to prepare
a really strong ball of yarn.

780
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:25,251
But for the pencil,
they say it's good to use one

781
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,961
that was used by a smart person.

782
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:31,591
I see. Would a ballpoint pen work too?

783
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,426
Is it okay to accept this?

784
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,511
Yes.

785
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,595
Thank you.

786
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,186
Thank you.

787
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,604
Get home safely.

788
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,983
-Mom, give that to me.
-No.

789
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,610
Give it. I'll carry it.

790
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,447
I hope she makes it
to the baby's first birthday.

791
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,493
She will.

792
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:01,746
Right.

793
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,667
Didn't your dad give you
that pen as a gift?

794
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,378
For when you got into med school.

795
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,505
Yes.

796
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,424
It doesn't matter.

797
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,719
I'll get going.

798
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,986
Hello, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

799
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,196
What?

800
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,324
That's dangerous. Hey, guys!

801
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,701
Stop it!

802
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,035
Get this bastard.

803
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,496
-Stop! This is a hospital!
-No way.

804
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,581
It can't be!

805
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,627
-I told you to stop!
-Oh, my!

806
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,795
My goodness!

807
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,298
-Oh, my!
-I said stop!

808
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,008
-You two must be crazy!
-Come on!

809
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,805
DOCTOR CHA

810
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,120
What's with you? I thought you were
all about maintaining your image.

811
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:27,707
Defend yourself. Otherwise, you might
end up on the chopping block.

812
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,001
Someone always has to be held accountable.

813
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,836
Hey, Seo In-ho!

814
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,755
It's annoying to the point
of driving me crazy,

815
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:34,881
so hurry up and leave.

816
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,132
You must have lost your mind.

817
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,301
If you say we should break up,
I'm going to kill you.

818
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,762
I'll wait until you finish your meal.

819
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,806
Let's get a divorce.

820
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:51,189
