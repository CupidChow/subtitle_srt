1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,811
Are you crazy? Why would you go up there?

3
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,480
You almost died!

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,151
Are you okay?

5
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,289
I'm glad you're safe.

6
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,426
I'm…

7
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,637
I'm fine.

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,388
I'm okay.

9
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,146
I have big news!

10
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,150
When I heard the rumor
about Professor Seo and Dr. Cha,

11
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,693
I was skeptical.

12
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,154
But then I saw it with my very own eyes.

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,615
"Are you crazy? You almost died!"

14
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,492
Professor Roy took it a step further.

15
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,246
"I'm glad you're safe."

16
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,832
You don't need to reenact everything.

17
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,625
What is this?

18
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,168
What could this be?

19
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,169
What do you mean?

20
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,129
What now?

21
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,298
Maybe they are in a love triangle! Right?

22
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,759
-Just eat your food, okay?
-Isn't it a love triangle?

23
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,927
It's nothing like that.

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,845
What?

25
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,471
How would you know, Dr. Jeon?

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,390
I just do.

27
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,476
Professor Seo and Dr. Cha
have nothing going on between them.

28
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,565
"Nothing's going on between them"?

29
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,485
Everyone heard the rumor that Dr. Cha
and Professor Seo are seeing each other.

30
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,821
Goodness, and you know Roy Kim?

31
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,698
That handsome professor is involved too.

32
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,950
People say they're in a love triangle.

33
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,869
I'm embarrassed even talking about this.

34
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,787
I mean, think about it.

35
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,332
How can someone her age not know
how to manage her reputation?

36
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,543
She's always the talk of the town.

37
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,588
Right, isn't Dr. Cha's next placement
in Family Medicine?

38
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,340
It is.

39
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,135
Professor Choi, make sure
to keep an eye on her

40
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,720
so weird rumors don't go around.

41
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,014
I will.

42
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,652
He can't just do that
to someone else's wife.

43
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,009
Are you all right?

44
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,220
Are you asking me?

45
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,138
You seemed quite shocked earlier.

46
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,642
I'm her husband but you seemed
even more shocked than I was.

47
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,810
I know, right?

48
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,647
I worry about Dr. Cha a lot.

49
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,860
In many respects.

50
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,656
I appreciate your concern

51
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,200
but I'm not sure
if Dr. Cha would welcome it too.

52
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,121
There's a lot of talk
going around the hospital.

53
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,601
Mr. Hwang has been sent
to the suicide prevention center,

54
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,645
and a Psychiatry Department consultation
has been requested.

55
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,272
Okay.

56
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,232
I heard what happened.

57
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,900
Are you okay?

58
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,902
Yes.

59
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,071
That's a relief.

60
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,074
It's a relief no one got hurt,

61
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,035
but this event could have been
avoided altogether

62
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,913
had we consulted
the Psychiatry Department to begin with.

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,711
His wife told you about the possibility
of a suicide attempt,

64
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,922
and I officially notified you as well.

65
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,757
So are you telling me

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,176
that I'm at fault for all of this?

67
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,682
No.

68
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,726
We're all at fault here.

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,243
Where are we going?

70
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,412
There's somewhere I wanted to take you.

71
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,916
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
CANCER WARD

72
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,838
I'm not telling you to feel comforted

73
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,674
by witnessing other people's unhappiness.

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,430
There are countless patients
in this building

75
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,224
struggling just to survive.

76
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,604
The families of all of these patients
are just as desperate.

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,107
No one other than you

78
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,486
knows the full extent of your pain.

79
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,780
So I won't say…

80
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,700
that I understand what you're feeling.

81
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,120
But I can tell you this.

82
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,044
There's no life on this earth…

83
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,755
that isn't precious.

84
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,758
Sir.

85
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,219
Being able to live and breathe

86
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:31,224
is something much more beautiful
than you think.

87
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,769
So don't die.

88
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,730
You must survive.

89
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,454
Still, please never do that again.
You scared me.

90
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,998
Sorry. You must have been so worried.

91
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,625
No, I'll take better care of you.

92
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,335
Are you okay?

93
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,795
I'm okay.

94
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,548
I'm really okay now.

95
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,849
I think he'll be okay.

96
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,937
His wife is young but devoted.

97
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,857
She comforted and persuaded him well.

98
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,775
So I think he'll be okay.

99
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,693
Okay.

100
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,029
And he cares about his wife too.

101
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,451
I'm just glad everything is okay.

102
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,369
Looking at that couple,

103
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,581
I felt kind of envious.

104
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,708
Envious?

105
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,171
Their love for each other seemed strong,

106
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,591
like they could overcome
any hardship together.

107
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,429
It made me wonder
if I have experienced that kind of love,

108
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,682
or if I have received that kind of love.

109
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,809
Thoughts like that.

110
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,644
It's silly, right?

111
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,397
At least you know it's silly.

112
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,030
After I-rang is done
with her college admissions,

113
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,616
let's all go on a family trip
to Jeju Island.

114
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,077
I haven't been there
since before we got married.

115
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,829
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,164
We went to Aewol together.

117
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,208
Aewol?

118
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,127
When did we go to Aewol?

119
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,838
We went to Aewol, do you not remember…

120
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,343
Who on earth did you go with?
Because it sure wasn't with me.

121
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,142
I went there for a conference.

122
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,272
You were so insistent
that for a moment I really thought I went.

123
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,484
Sorry, I mixed things up.

124
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,780
Jeez, my memory these days.

125
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,620
Look at you, working so hard.

126
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,789
You wanted me
to show my resolve with results.

127
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,667
Still, don't push yourself too hard
and get stressed.

128
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,627
Just work hard like you always had.

129
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,337
I'm going to work harder than that.

130
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,174
WHAT TIME WILL YOU GET TO THE ACADEMY?

131
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,516
-Are you close with Eun-seo?
-Why are you peeking at my phone?

132
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,434
How did you two become close?

133
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,270
What do you mean?

134
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,856
We go to the same academy,
so we ran into each other at a cafe,

135
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,110
and we exchanged lecture notes.
That's how we became friends.

136
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,154
So her mom's a doctor.

137
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,323
What does her father do?

138
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,075
I think her parents are divorced.

139
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,412
I didn't ask in detail,
so I don't know much.

140
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,509
Your carry has increased,
and your speed is good too.

141
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,805
But if you raise your shoulders
when you swing up,

142
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,307
it messes up your aim.

143
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,433
Your turn.

144
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,851
Shall I?

145
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,647
But you know, didn't you get

146
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,319
an offer from Jaemin University Hospital?

147
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,528
I did.

148
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,322
If their offer was good,

149
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,949
wouldn't it be good to accept it
and raise your pay rate?

150
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,329
They offered a similar salary,
and it's too far from home.

151
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,497
And they already hired someone else.

152
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,207
I see.

153
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,418
I just thought I'd ask.

154
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,925
Is something wrong?

155
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,135
What?

156
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,553
No.

157
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,263
I'm good.

158
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,271
The ball went way off the mark.

159
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,357
Or is your club bent?

160
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,860
I know, I can't seem to get it right.

161
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,363
Right.

162
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,616
Eun-seo came in second
in a national art competition.

163
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,701
You should meet and congratulate her.

164
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,334
How can you not even once
suggest meeting her first?

165
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,674
Honestly, I can't look her in the eyes.

166
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,844
It's scary when she looks at me
with such contempt.

167
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,806
It's because you haven't made an effort.

168
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,891
An effort to get close to her.

169
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,686
Fine. I'll try.

170
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,230
Tell her I want to meet.

171
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,566
I should buy her something delicious.

172
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,695
-Mom!
-Ji-yun.

173
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,948
-Yes, sir. We've just come out.
-Bye.

174
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,994
-Hello.
-Hello.

175
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,162
Hello.

176
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,957
Hi, Mom.

177
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,252
I'm on my way home.
I'm in a taxi with I-rang.

178
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,797
Your dad heard you won an award
and wants to treat you to a nice dinner.

179
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,341
It's not because you begged him
to meet me?

180
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,176
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

181
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,139
He wants to meet you
and congratulate you on your award.

182
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,224
Really?

183
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,643
If you don't want to see him,
you don't have to.

184
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,728
No, let's meet.

185
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,440
I think it'll be fun if we meet.

186
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,989
-Tell him I want to meet him soon.
-Okay.

187
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,826
What's going on?

188
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,953
It's nothing.

189
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,890
AT THE SCHOOL LAWN
DON'T FALL ASLEEP IN-HO

190
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,057
FIRST PHOTO BOOTH PIC WITH IN-HO

191
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,684
HAN RIVER DATE WITH IN-HO

192
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,644
OUR LOVE IS FOREVER
IN-HO, SEUNG-HI

193
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,695
EUN-SEO IS STILL AFRAID OF CAMERAS
YOU SHOULD SMILE

194
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,914
Here, cheers.

195
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,665
Sure.

196
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,376
Come on, talk to her.

197
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:21,383
Right. Eun-seo, I heard the award you won
is a really big award.

198
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,178
It'll help your college admissions, right?

199
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,262
Of course.

200
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,516
Yes, but you must dread
the fact that I-rang and I both

201
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,142
don't want to go to med school.

202
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,315
Well, I am a little disappointed.

203
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,151
But how did you two become friends?

204
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,072
I knew we were in the same academy,
so I approached her on purpose.

205
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,326
Eun-seo!

206
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,621
Why?

207
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,705
Why do you think?

208
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,667
Because I'm curious and annoyed
about your family, Dad.

209
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,966
Don't tell me…

210
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,553
you're thinking
of telling I-rang everything.

211
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,889
I think it's a little too late
for you to be asking me that.

212
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,085
What's going on?

213
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,296
Why are you here, Dad?

214
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,343
I-rang, the thing is…

215
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,513
The truth is that your dad is my dad.

216
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,182
I just thought that you should know.

217
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,979
Your thoughtless naivety
really annoyed me this entire time.

218
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,356
Do you not get it?

219
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,942
We're half-sisters!

220
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,986
We have different moms, but the same dad!

221
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,030
-Just stop!
-Don't yell at my daughter!

222
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,404
I did what you couldn't for 20 years.

223
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,116
Why did you keep hiding
when it's this easy to say the truth?

224
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,669
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,008
"But a man
who commits adultery has no sense."

226
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,719
Why are you here at this hour?

227
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,555
Is I-rang not home yet?

228
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,140
No, she's not.

229
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,856
She's here.

230
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,692
Is Mom home?

231
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,070
She has night duty. Why?

232
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,699
Grandma.

233
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,660
Why did you do such a poor job
of raising your son?

234
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,163
What?

235
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,916
-What did you just say?
-You raised him completely wrong!

236
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,256
I guess I should congratulate you.

237
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,300
You have another granddaughter.

238
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,470
Oh, my! Really?

239
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,554
She's my age.

240
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,139
Seo I-rang.

241
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,024
Don't ever tell Mom.

242
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,405
I really don't know what I'll do
if Mom finds out too.

243
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,166
Hey, In-ho.

244
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,545
What's with her?

245
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,552
You crazy bastard!

246
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,469
Damn you!

247
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,891
A love child?

248
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,145
Gosh, dear Lord.

249
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,356
What do I do with this sinful child?

250
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,651
How could you do such a thing?

251
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,570
What were you thinking?

252
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,156
What could I do
when she decided to keep the baby?

253
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,741
You married Jeong-suk
after she got pregnant with Jung-min.

254
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,078
How could you make the same mistake twice?

255
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,913
A mistake most people don't even make!

256
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,457
And you still consider yourself
an intellectual?

257
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,128
By the way, how did I-rang find out?

258
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,172
My other daughter…

259
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,841
told her.

260
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,967
What do we do?

261
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,345
Who gave birth to such a vicious daughter?

262
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,516
You know…

263
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,186
the mother too.

264
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,104
Me?

265
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,814
I do?

266
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,066
How could I know her?

267
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,902
Who on earth is it?

268
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,073
Seung-hi.

269
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,035
Seung-hi?

270
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,914
Seung-hi?

271
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,374
The Seung-hi you dated in college?

272
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,543
Yes.

273
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,379
Goodness.

274
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,014
Are you looking for someone?

275
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,099
I wanted to see Professor Seo In-ho.

276
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,310
He left for the day.

277
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:33,357
Actually, Professor Seo performed surgery
on me five years ago,

278
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,275
and I made a full recovery.

279
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,696
During that time,
I published a collection of poems.

280
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,031
I wanted to give it to him.

281
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,868
Could you give this to him for me?

282
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,537
Of course, I'll make sure he gets it.

283
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,997
-Thank you.
-Sure.

284
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,799
"To Professor Seo In-ho,
whom I respect and am grateful for."

285
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,185
So you've been seeing Seung-hi
even after you got married?

286
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,396
No.

287
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,398
When I was a resident,

288
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,401
I went to the US for training.

289
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,318
Right.

290
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,197
I met Seung-hi again at that hospital.
She was doing her residency there.

291
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,742
I was happy to see her.

292
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,704
And it made me think of our past.

293
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,082
After my residency, I came back to Korea.

294
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,668
Then she called me
saying she was pregnant,

295
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,712
but Jeong-suk was pregnant then too.

296
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,008
What could I do?

297
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,011
I was at a loss for words,
so she said she'd take care of it.

298
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,265
But I had no idea that meant
she was going to have the baby.

299
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,684
Seung-hi is a fool too.

300
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,896
Why would a girl that has everything
have a child without a father?

301
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,150
She asked me to consider us divorced
and act as the child's father,

302
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,152
so I met them whenever they came to Korea.

303
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,238
But three years ago,
they came back to Korea for good.

304
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,451
So you're saying you maintained
two families for all these years?

305
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,038
Strictly speaking,
I did not maintain two families.

306
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,499
But once Seung-hi came back to Korea,
we saw each other often,

307
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,960
and those feelings--

308
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,295
Are you bragging right now?

309
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,881
You knocked up a girl
and had an affair for three years.

310
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:21,965
What else would you call it?

311
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,925
Mom, don't be so crass--

312
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,595
Do you think I can stay refined right now?

313
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,765
What does Seung-hi do now?

314
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,309
Does she own a clinic?

315
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,603
Actually, Seung-hi…

316
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,645
Yes?

317
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,148
…works at our hospital

318
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,527
-in the same department as Jeong-suk.
-You darn little…

319
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,447
You don't deserve
to be called a human being.

320
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,784
I must have given birth to a wild animal!

321
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,494
How can you even go about your day

322
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,038
when your wife and mistress
are working at the same hospital?

323
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,665
Jeong-suk is the one
who started working against my will.

324
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,917
Shut up!

325
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,668
What are you going to do?

326
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,008
Make sure Jeong-suk doesn't find out.

327
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,053
You've fooled her until now.
Make sure she stays in the dark.

328
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,639
But I-rang knows.

329
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,307
Did you not see her before?

330
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,976
She was against Jeong-suk finding out.

331
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,770
Try and persuade her.

332
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,647
I'll talk to her too.

333
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,192
-Okay.
-Also,

334
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,111
allow I-rang to go to art school.

335
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,447
How do you expect to go against her now?

336
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,074
Damn you!

337
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,557
Who is it?

338
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,017
That startled me.

339
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,104
So what's your point?

340
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,940
"Don't tell Mom"?

341
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,985
I'd be grateful if you didn't.

342
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,863
Fine, that was my plan too.

343
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,364
I want to make this clear.

344
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:14,619
I'm not exposing your affairs
for Mom's sake, not yours.

345
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,539
Whatever the reason may be,

346
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:22,127
I hope you can think of it
as maintaining the peace in this family.

347
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,545
That brings me to this point.

348
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,549
With this opportunity, I decided
to reconsider your future and college,

349
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:33,054
and despite my own beliefs,
I have decided to support your dreams…

350
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,640
You don't have to ramble on like that.

351
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,977
I get that you're supporting me
because you're so damn sorry.

352
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,564
I got your message,
so can you please get out?

353
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,608
Okay.

354
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,161
But what school
do you have your eyes set on?

355
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,705
Why? You want me to go
to Hanguk University?

356
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,291
This country still cares a lot
about what school--

357
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,043
Please just leave!

358
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,183
Hello.

359
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:29,527

00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,669

362
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,965
MEET ME AT EAST WING
2ND FLOOR EMERGENCY EXIT AT 5:00 P.M.

363
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,412
Hello.

364
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,223
When you asked me
if I was mentally strong,

365
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,061
were you worrying for me
before you tore my family apart?

366
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,896
I wasn't worrying.

367
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,689
I was giving a warning.

368
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,651
I think you've misunderstood something.

369
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,655
Just because I know the truth
doesn't mean I'll tell my mom.

370
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,910
You and I can just continue living
as we always have.

371
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,620
Right.

372
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,705
You'll have to move academies.

373
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,666
Did it never occur to you
that I'd take things further?

374
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,584
What?

375
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,628
You're going to tell my mom?

376
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,422
Do you think
I'll just stand back and watch?

377
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,592
My mom may be a resident,
but your mom is a professor.

378
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,760
My mom is a victim.

379
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,512
Your mom is the perpetrator.
A home-wrecker!

380
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,847
Then your father isn't an adulterer?

381
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,270
You said we have the same dad.

382
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,525
Will you be okay?

383
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,027
Your mom is a home-wrecker.

384
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,279
Your dad is an adulterer.

385
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,492
You're a cheating couple's daughter.

386
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,488
Get it together!

387
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,991
I said to move
the intestines to the right.

388
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,492
Do you not know which way that is?

389
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:05,910
I'm sorry.

390
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,165
Why are you daydreaming?
Did you not sleep last night?

391
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,625
No, I'll do it properly.

392
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,004
Lift it up more.

393
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,589
Bring in the camera.

394
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,849
CHANGING ROOMS
STORAGE

395
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,235
Father.

396
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,571
What?

397
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,490
We should address each other
in a professional--

398
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,074
Are you close with Professor Choi?

399
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,704
Why are you asking that?

400
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,622
Are you two…

401
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,707
having an affair?

402
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,004
Well…

403
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,054
Did I-rang tell you?

404
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,767
Did you hear from your grandma?

405
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,311
-They both know?
-Then how on earth did you find out?

406
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,480
I mean, the whole family knows?

407
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,151
Wait, that means all the rumors are true.

408
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,696
Does Mom know too?

409
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,324
Your mom doesn't know,
and she can't find out.

410
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,035
You can never let her find out.

411
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,038
She's not healthy, and her work is taxing.

412
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,165
Anyway, she can never know.

413
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,084
Yes, I agree.

414
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,299
I know you must be in shock
and I have no excuses to give you.

415
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:47,303
But Jung-min, as an adult man,
I believe that you'll understand me.

416
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,681
No, I don't want to understand you.

417
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,769
There was a time when I wanted
to become a talented doctor like you.

418
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,397
I respected you.

419
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,690
But not anymore.

420
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,025
I'm disappointed in you, Father.

421
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,425
Jung-min, have you eaten?

422
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,844
What about you, Mom?

423
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,475
Hearing you call me Mom here
makes me so happy.

424
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,605
What about your medicine?
Are you keeping up with it?

425
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:24,609
Of course. I put an alarm on
and take it regularly.

426
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,778
Do you want to have dinner?

427
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,196
My treat.

428
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,285
What a shame. I'm on night duty today.

429
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,995
Shall I take your night duty today?

430
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,373
You seem really tired.

431
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,041
It's okay.

432
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,102
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,821
"The shameful truth about Actor S,

434
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,906
who made my daughter a single mother?"

435
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,825
Who could this be?

436
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,243
Stop looking at gossip.

437
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,997
What are you doing?

438
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,374
It's Seo Min-jun.

439
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,086
What about Seo Min-jun?

440
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,796
The internet is blowing up.

441
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,548
Apparently, he abandoned
his pregnant girlfriend.

442
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,843
The girl's parents posted it
on the national civil complaints website.

443
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,220
Really?

444
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,639
I liked Seo Min-jun.

445
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,266
How disappointing.

446
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,183
ACTOR SEO MIN-JUN'S IMAGE TARNISHED

447
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,190
Right, I knew I recognized him
from somewhere.

448
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,358
What are you talking about?

449
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,944
I think I just saw Seo Min-jun
in front of the ward.

450
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,155
-Really?
-Yes, Seo Min-jun.

451
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,285
Who told you to upload that post?

452
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,122
I said it wasn't him!
I said he wasn't the baby's father!

453
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,915
Just look how devoted you are!

454
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,334
Do you think he'll be grateful
that you're protecting him?

455
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,129
Fine, if it's not him, then who is it?

456
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,258
You have to tell us the truth
for us to believe otherwise!

457
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:20,224
Excuse me, is this Yoo Ji-seon's room?

458
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,392
Who are you?

459
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,313
I'm Seo Min-jun's agent.

460
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,548
Are you sure it was Seo Min-jun?

461
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,052
I ran into him right in front of the ward,
and we bumped into each other.

462
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,472
And then he said, "I'm sorry."
That voice was Seo Min-jun's!

463
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,723
It really was him.

464
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,309
-It was Seo Min-jun. This is crazy.
-No way.

465
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,353
Was it not?

466
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:10,399
No, his voice sounded
just like Seo Min-jun.

467
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,901
The reverberation of his voice.

468
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,613
I couldn't forget his voice
when he said he was sorry.

469
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,031
Dr. Cha.

470
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,658
What? Yes?

471
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:23,162
When you went to my dorm room
to get my phone, did you clean it?

472
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,956
Well…

473
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,791
Yes.

474
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,544
There was no space left to move,

475
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,672
so I instinctively cleaned things up
since you are so busy.

476
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,675
Did I tell you to clean it?

477
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,760
You didn't.

478
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,011
Then?

479
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,141
Why did you just touch
someone else's things without asking?

480
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,062
It was my mistake
to touch your things without asking.

481
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,981
Don't touch my things from now on.

482
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,733
It's unpleasant.

483
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,619
Why didn't you tell me?

484
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,165
If you did, I would've
taken responsibility no matter what.

485
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,417
Why did you not tell me?

486
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,923
But at least I know now.

487
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,014
I'm sorry.

488
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,932
I'll take down the post

489
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,643
and upload an explanation
that it's not true.

490
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,646
You don't need to do that.

491
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,023
I don't want to lie.

492
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,401
The baby's father

493
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,028
isn't you.

494
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,447
You are not the father.

495
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,742
It's my ex-boyfriend's baby.

496
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,822
Hey, Mi-hee.

497
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,910
Why? You want to go running again?

498
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,496
Then what will you do?

499
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,874
Me? I'm making side dishes.

500
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,210
Really?

501
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,421
Okay.

502
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,339
Bye.

503
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,426
-Mother.
-What?

504
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,886
-Honey?
-Yes?

505
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,973
Can I go out to meet Mi-hee for a bit?

506
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,099
Go.

507
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,142
Of course. Go get some fresh air.

508
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,771
I feel so bad though. We haven't had
a family gathering in a while.

509
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,564
It's okay.
I can come home again next week.

510
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,275
That sounds good to me.

511
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,402
Okay, then I'll be back.

512
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,293
-Mother, I'll be back.
-All right.

513
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,585
-See you later.
-Okay.

514
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,212
-Bye.
-Okay.

515
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,599
It's really painful to see Mom like that
when she doesn't know anything.

516
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,313
End things with that woman
as soon as possible

517
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,106
before Mom finds out.

518
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:38,899
The thing is…

519
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:45,906
That relationship isn't something
that he can end that easily.

520
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,325
He had a child with her.

521
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,453
A child?

522
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,247
A daughter. Same age as me.

523
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,498
Crazy, right?

524
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,269
He must be nauseated.

525
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,857
Well, it's understandable.

526
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,493
Lately, my stocks are tanking

527
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,536
and there are no young guys who like me.

528
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,914
Life is just no fun.

529
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,124
But still, your clinic is doing well.

530
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,753
What's the point when all that money
just goes to paying the bank interest?

531
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:46,217
When you think of that,
salaried workers have it nice, don't they?

532
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,262
-On that note.
-Yes?

533
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,889
Let's go get our fortunes read.

534
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,766
-A psychic reading.
-Hey.

535
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,519
My mom goes to church.

536
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,438
Don't even think about getting married.

537
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,232
What?

538
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:05,528
As long as you don't see a man,
you have no cause for worry or concern.

539
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,322
Don't come back here
unless you get yourself a man.

540
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,574
Dear Lord.

541
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,870
Ask her if you are curious about anything.

542
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,622
Me?

543
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,713
Is my husband cheating on me?

544
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,257
He's seeing another woman?

545
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,593
Mom can never, ever find out.

546
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:34,348
Father, Grandma, I-rang,
just act as you always have.

547
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,016
That's what I think too.

548
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,893
Having an affair is one thing,

549
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:43,816
but it'll kill her if she finds out
that your affair produced a child.

550
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:44,775
What about you, Father?

551
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,780
I have no right to say anything.

552
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,782
Just as I said last time,

553
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,202
nothing good will come
from your mother knowing.

554
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,913
I-rang, you're on board, right?

555
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,958
I guess you do have
a meticulous side to you.

556
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,128
-Do you take after Dad in this regard?
-No!

557
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:13,846
I don't know if it'll be possible to act
like nothing's wrong

558
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,056
while hiding this big issue.

559
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,976
They say that life is like one big play.

560
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,353
My gosh.

561
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,313
Father.

562
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,566
How long are you planning
to maintain two families?

563
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,818
I guess you would've kept going
if you didn't get caught.

564
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,238
Decide in three years,
when Mom will be done with her residency.

565
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,700
Divorce Mom and choose that woman,

566
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,786
or break up with that woman
and stay with Mom.

567
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,080
Promise me you'll choose.

568
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,465
You already know.

569
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,342
What…

570
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,345
-What do you mean?
-That your husband…

571
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,640
has zero charm.

572
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,892
Gosh.

573
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,394
He's not that bad.

574
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,854
You're the one men chase after!

575
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,025
-What?
-Me?

576
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,151
He's close by.

577
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,111
Think carefully.

578
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,489
Be careful.

579
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:18,744
You have a rare fate.
More men cling to you as you get older.

580
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,579
What on earth?

581
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,915
What on earth is this?

582
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,169
Jeez, what a waste of time and money.

583
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,129
Hey, what in the world?

584
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,926
I guess your luck with men
will kick in later in life.

585
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,053
What nonsense are you talking about?

586
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,888
Why would men like someone like me?

587
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,475
Why did that woman say something
so preposterous?

588
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,643
Look at you.

589
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,937
Do you know how accurate this place is?

590
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,692
Well-known assemblymen
and celebrities wait in line

591
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,319
to get their fortunes told here,
you crazy woman.

592
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,031
She's gifted.
She knew your husband had zero charm.

593
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,159
Hey, you little…

594
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,455
But why do you look so unwell?

595
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,582
Oh, my.

596
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,625
Do I look gaunt?

597
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,378
Did something bad happen?

598
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,462
Goodness.

599
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,674
Professor, you should be a fortune teller.

600
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,217
The truth is…

601
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,387
my son has caused some trouble.

602
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,932
He's a professor at a big hospital.
What trouble could he have caused?

603
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,684
Does he, perhaps,

604
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,686
have another woman?

605
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,999
In the end,
my whole family learned the truth.

606
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,376
Did you come to brag about that?

607
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,880
I'll take care of everything
when my wife finishes her residency.

608
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,922
One way or another.

609
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,843
So I'm hoping that you won't interfere.

610
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,930
Since I don't want my ill wife
to suffer any shock.

611
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,807
How…

612
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,017
considerate of you.

613
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,396
That's why I'm asking you
to keep silent about this.

614
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,900
I understand what you're telling me.

615
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,194
But I'm not sure

616
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,613
if my lips will cooperate.

617
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:48,018
One person says to tell her,
and the other says to keep silent.

618
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,896
Gosh.

619
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,649
What a fun scene I'm witnessing
from the middle.

620
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,820
Do you still want me to tell Dr. Cha?

621
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,780
I thought you already declined.

622
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,906
Just wait.

623
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,741
Who knows?

624
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,620
I might grant one of you your wish.

625
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,165
You two really suit each other.

626
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,668
You create a mess without any hesitation.

627
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,003
But your solution is cowardly.

628
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,007
It might've been better

629
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,176
to face it head-on.

630
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,619
This is K-Fantastique Hotel, right?

631
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,998
I want to make a reservation
for five for next Tuesday.

632
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,667
It's my daughter-in-law's
birthday that day.

633
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,502
Can you also prepare a cake?

634
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,838
MEDICAL LICENSE
NAME: SEO IN-HO

635
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,465
A hotel? Why there?

636
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,508
It's Jeong-suk's birthday.

637
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,509
I see.

638
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,844
It's a great excuse.

639
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:08,015
We can all gather as a family
and make her feel good

640
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,309
by celebrating her birthday
and giving her gifts.

641
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,895
You've been lucky until now,

642
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:16,190
but she works with Seung-hi,
so you might end up getting caught.

643
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,610
Keep an eye on her
so she doesn't do anything fishy.

644
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,028
I won't allow you to get divorced.

645
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,654
I'm hanging up.

646
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,289
Are you looking
for something in particular?

647
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,291
I haven't decided on anything,

648
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,460
but I want to buy
my daughter-in-law a gift.

649
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,295
What a great mother-in-law.

650
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,215
All mothers-in-law
are like this these days.

651
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,591
It's not like the old times.

652
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,885
-Can you show me that bag?
-Okay.

653
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,307
How much does this cost?

654
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,435
The medium size costs 2.3 million won.

655
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,562
And the large size is 2.9 million won.

656
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,902
Well, can you show me
some wallets or scarves?

657
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:02,819
Okay.

658
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,328
It suits you so well
since you have such fair skin.

659
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,287
I'll take this.

660
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,762
My shoulder hurts so badly.

661
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:30,931
Is there any good medicine for that?

662
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,307
Please wait one moment.

663
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,063
Hello?

664
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,235
What is this?

665
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,487
Think of it as a sign of appreciation.

666
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,991
This is supposed
to work wonders on wrinkles.

667
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:52,160
What's the point
of getting rid of wrinkles at my age?

668
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,912
It's not like I'm going to get remarried.

669
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,456
You're so witty, Ms. Oh.

670
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,919
Gosh, people kept saying
it wasn't a serious illness.

671
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,964
But after the surgery,
I couldn't help but be depressed

672
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,174
while lying in that hospital bed.

673
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:10,429
But you prepared
all that food with such care.

674
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:15,809
You don't even understand
how touched I was.

675
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,937
Why is she being so respectful?

676
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:23,567
Well, it's a relief
if it brought you some comfort.

677
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,945
Then I'll accept this gift with gratitude.

678
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:27,946
Yes.

679
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,534
I want to try your rice punch
one more time.

680
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,078
I guess you've never
made rice punch before.

681
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,079
I haven't.

682
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,707
It takes a lot of effort to make.

683
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,419
You strain your wrists
from kneading the malt.

684
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,462
I see.

685
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,048
I didn't know.

686
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,804
You haven't been able to see Jeong-suk
often these days, right?

687
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,057
Yes, she's very busy.

688
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,267
But even if it's hard, she likes working.

689
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,812
Of course, even though it's hard,
she finds it rewarding.

690
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,231
I see.

691
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:17,913
She's not the type to thank me like this
for making rice punch.

692
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:23,418
She never thanked me once
for sending her kimchi every season.

693
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,804
She definitely doesn't know.

694
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,933
Jeong-suk doesn't know,
and neither does her mother.

695
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,400
Hey

696
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:51,363
What's the point in blaming
The unavoidable passing of time?

697
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,662
I have no intention of breaking up
with Professor Seo.

698
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,957
If you want
to tell her about us, go ahead.

699
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,043
I'll take care of everything
when my wife finishes her residency.

700
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,296
So I'm hoping that you won't interfere.

701
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,187
Professor, are you leaving work now?

702
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,400
I should.

703
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,279
You look like you're in a good mood.

704
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,450
-Is it obvious?
-Yes.

705
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,537
To tell you the truth,
today is my birthday.

706
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,916
I'm having dinner at a hotel
with my whole family.

707
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,418
I know it's not a big deal,

708
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,754
but I'm excited
we'll be having dinner at a hotel.

709
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,339
With your family?

710
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,633
I guess Professor Seo

711
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,218
will be there too.

712
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:57,763
That's right.

713
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,849
I'll get going now.

714
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,393
Dr. Cha.

715
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,899
I have something to tell you.

716
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,943
It's something difficult to say.

717
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,071
And I'm not sure…

718
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,115
if I should be saying this.

719
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,534
You're the one men chase after!

720
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,036
He's close by.

721
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,621
Think carefully.

722
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,500
Then I think it's best
that you don't say it.

723
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,044
If it's difficult to say,

724
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,047
and if you're unsure
whether you should say it or not,

725
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,049
then it would be best
not to say it, right?

726
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,928
That's true.

727
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,596
Then I'll get going now.

728
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,307
Happy birthday.

729
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,150
It's okay to say that, right?

730
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,876
Aren't you leaving?

731
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,378
Not yet.

732
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,088
I want to put in
some prescription orders first.

733
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,759
Did you get back from a vacation?

734
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,177
This isn't my account.

735
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,471
It's Professor Choi's social media page.

736
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,557
I found it
through another doctor's account.

737
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,641
Her life is so luxurious.

738
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,478
I wish I could live like this too.

739
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,772
I guess she went to Paris too.

740
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,324
#BUSINESSCLASS #GLASSOFWINE
#EUROPE #PIT-A-PAT #TRIPTOPARIS

741
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,579
Oh, my.

742
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,540
I think she has a boyfriend.

743
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:50,917
Or is it her husband?

744
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,795
-Why do you say that?
-"Couple Goals."

745
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,131
It's a tag used only by couples.

746
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,972
Wasn't there a conference in Paris
around this time?

747
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,810
I think Professor Seo said
he went to a conference there.

748
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:13,064
I'm not sure, but Professor Seo
didn't go to a conference then.

749
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,569
I remember him rescheduling an operation
because he was going on vacation.

750
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,446
Vacation?

751
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,823
Professor Seo

752
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,367
went on vacation during that time?

753
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,785
Yes.

754
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,789
Gosh, this is so pretty.

755
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,048

757
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,094
Can I…

758
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,805
also access her social media?

759
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,350
What? You can if you search her ID.

760
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:10,121
Is your condition bad enough
that I have to cancel my conference?

761
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,504
A bracelet?

762
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,005
AVICHEN 24K DIAMOND BRACELET

763
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,634
I'm sorry to ask,

764
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,885
but could you tell me…

765
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,221
where you bought that bracelet?

766
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,348
Why do you have to be sorry
for asking me that?

767
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,686
My husband bought it for me,
so I don't know where he got it.

768

777
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,321
How many times have they come?

778
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,198
They always come…

779
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,326
-Jeong-suk.
-Hello.

780
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,078
-It's been a while.
-Hello.

781
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,204
What brings you here?

782
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,205
Dr. Moon,

783
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,209
remember when I said I'd switch positions
with you from Family Medicine?

784
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,294
I'll need to take that back.

785
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,715
I have to go to the Family Medicine
Department for my next dispatch.

786
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,551
But a promise is a promise.

787
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,094
I'm really sorry.

788
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,346
It's difficult to explain,

789
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,974
but it can't be helped.

790
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,893
If you didn't want to switch,
you should've said so.

791
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,145
So annoying.

792
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,731
Fine.

793
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,943
Your attitude makes me
not want to switch with you even more.

794
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,947
I'm going to Family Medicine next,
just as I was supposed to.

795
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,740
Got it, sweetie?

796
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,702
Why are you calling me "sweetie"?

797
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,620
Don't treat me like a child
just because you're old.

798
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,004
When we first met, you told me

799
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,631
you hated those who want special treatment
just because they're older.

800
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,884
But to me,

801
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,637
I hate those who are rude,
regardless of age.

802
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,556
I absolutely hate it!

803
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,566
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO:
I'M AT K-FANTASTIQUE HOTEL

804
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,945
IT'S MY WIFE'S BIRTHDAY

805
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,833
Can you all try to look happy?

806
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,710
No long faces on Jeong-suk's birthday.

807
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,047
Grandma, you should have been an actress.

808
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,340
Don't be sarcastic.

809
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,884
I'm struggling to protect my family too.

810
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:36,721
Who did Dad take after
to grow up to be such a womanizer?

811
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:40,099
Just because I gave birth to him
doesn't mean I know everything.

812
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,936
You were raised poorly.

813
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:43,978
Seo I-rang!

814
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,482
Don't tell I-rang off.
You don't have the right.

815
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,734
-What?
-You're right.

816
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,778
I didn't raise him properly.

817
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,072
I deserve to be criticized.

818
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:55,949
See, In-ho?

819
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,493
You lose all your respect
as the man of the house

820
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,286
when you have an affair.

821
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,038
I know that too. Why do you have to…

822
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:03,998
That's enough.

823
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,917
How could Seung-hi have a kid
without telling you?

824
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,710
Is she trying to destroy our family?

825
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,714
She is just as pathetic too.

826
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,883
She didn't do it on her own.

827
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,719
Both parties are clearly at fault here.

828
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,221
Everyone, be quiet!

829
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,818
How pathetic.

830
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:14,902
Mom's here.

831
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,322
Mom.

832
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,490
-Mom.
-Hey, Jeong-suk.

833
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,525
DOCTOR CHA

834
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:59,799
I am going to leave this house.

835
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,592
You'll see your husband at his worst.

836
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,469
What do you think you're doing right now?

837
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,680
Simply put, it's a dirty fight.

838
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:09,392
What if I just want a clean divorce?

839
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,853
My wife is very sociable, isn't she?

840
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:15,815
Are you going to reveal the truth?
About you and her?

841
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,651
Honey!

842
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:25,825
