1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,274
How pathetic.

3
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,484
Mom's here.

4
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,903
Mom.

5
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,030
-Mom.
-Hey, Jeong-suk.

6
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:14,050
I saw a woman standing right over there

7
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,886
and I kept staring at her
because she was so stunning.

8
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,598
It turned out to be
none other than my daughter-in-law.

9
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,059
It was my daughter-in-law.

10
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,312
You really dressed up today.

11
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,315
You look like a totally different person.

12
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,943
You don't look like my mom.

13
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,530
More like someone I want to
be friends with?

14
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,449
Mom, you look amazing today.

15
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,537
The cake is here.

16
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,792
Oh, my. Take a look at that.
In-ho prepared a lot today.

17
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,752
TO MY BELOVED WIFE
CHA JEONG-SUK

18
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,257
I'm not sure if you'll like it.
Please light the candles.

19
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,144
What are you waiting for?
Let's all sing happy birthday to her.

20
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,114
Jung-min, take a video.

21
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,378
I'll blow them out.

22
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,176
Let's make a toast.

23
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,637
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

24
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,023
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

25
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,569
MY DAUGHTER EUN-SEO

26
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,824
Look over here.

27
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,201
One, two, three.

28
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,578
Got it.

29
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,709
MOM, HURRY UP AND COME HOME,
I'M GOING TO ORDER FRIED CHICKEN

30
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,593
Go on and open them.

31
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,346
It's polite to open gifts on the spot.

32
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,555
Later.

33
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,391
Once we get home.

34
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,019
It's going to take a while
for the food to come out, so open them.

35
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,521
Yes, right.

36
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,943
That's from me.

37
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,529
You can wear them when you're working.

38
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,075
They're so pretty. Thank you.

39
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,454
Mom, it seemed
like you didn't have any perfume.

40
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,130
It smells so nice.

41
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,756
Thank you, Jung-min.

42
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,384
That's from me.

43
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,013
You know that's a designer brand, right?

44
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,306
Of course.

45
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,390
Mother, thank you.

46
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,231
Thank you.

47
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,318
In-ho, do you not have a gift?

48
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:57,023
I'll give you these instead
since I already gave you your gift.

49
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,817
Happy birthday.

50
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:08,951
Thank you.

51
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,331
I can't believe I got flowers from you.

52
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,626
I never thought
a day like this would come.

53
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,881
We can have
more days like this from now on.

54
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,142
Shall we have some cake
before the food comes out?

55
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,519
-Sounds good.
-All right.

56
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,188
There.

57
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,942
"To my beloved wife, Cha Jeong-suk."
This is for you.

58
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,155
All right.

59
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,991
I'm a little hungry. Can you cut the cake?

60
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,037
I think cutting it three times
would be sufficient.

61
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,410
This is hilarious.

62
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,373
Honey, consider this my birthday gift too.

63
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,792
I've wanted to do this for so long.

64
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,045
Now I get why people do this.

65
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,464
How should I put it?

66
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,300
It feels cathartic.

67
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,763
Sorry, I must have startled you.

68
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,397
Are you okay?

69
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,741
-Does it taste good?
-I'm okay.

70
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,452
You seem shocked.

71
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,953
Not at all.

72
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,922
Goodness, this song brings back memories.

73
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,633
Didn't you like this song in college?

74
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,971
You must mean
your ex-girlfriend did, not me.

75
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,316
Sorry.

76
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,027
I did like it too.

77
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,364
You liked it too, right?

78
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,116
See.

79
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,743
My memory isn't that bad.

80
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,328
How amazing.

81
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,330
It's not something to be amazed about.

82
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,957
It's not that.

83
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,835
Your ex-girlfriend

84
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,713
had similar tastes to mine.

85
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,506
From songs…

86
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,466
to men.

87
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:59,724
I'm curious if that woman
married a man like you.

88
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,103
You're curious about the oddest things.

89
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,022
What matters is our family, right?

90
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,610
Isn't your wedding anniversary next month?

91
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,447
-Right.
-Let's have a meal at another hotel then.

92
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,449
Sounds good. It'll be my treat.

93
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,700
Gosh, thank you.

94
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,702
Mom, tell us about your wedding.

95
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,122
I heard it was hilarious
thanks to Auntie Mi-hee's awful singing.

96
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,957
-You're right.
-That's right.

97
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,126
And Dad, I heard you had
the wrong tuxedo delivered,

98
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,211
but you wore it anyway to the wedding.

99
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,546
You're right.

100
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,635
Yes.

101
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,764
It was a complete mess.

102
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,855
I'll love you forever

103
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:52,652
I will love you like this very moment

104
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,865
I will love you

105
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,372
More than anyone else in this world

106
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,920
I'll arouse your curiosity

107
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,883
With difficult stories

108
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,594
I can pass this whole night away

109
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:24,058
With that game that everybody plays

110
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,396
But I…

111
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,231
Have a long-lasting marriage!

112
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,362
I was so upset that day.

113
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,740
Jeez, there wasn't a single thing I liked.

114
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,785
After that wedding,
I couldn't go to the class reunion

115
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,579
because everything
was an absolute disgrace--

116
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,271
Let me out.

117
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,480
I don't feel well.

118
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,066
Okay.

119
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,783
-Jeong-suk.
-Mom, are you okay?

120
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,411
-Jung-min, follow her out.
-Come on.

121
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,539
-Mom's leaving.
-No, this way.

122
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,208
-Wait, there's a car behind us.
-There's a car coming.

123
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,585
I'll get going for now.

124
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,381
Hey.

125
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,091
Do you think she caught on?

126
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,136
Did you see her face when she smashed
In-ho's face into the cake?

127
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,846
It didn't look like she was joking at all.

128
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,765
No way. She was laughing
like it was a joke.

129
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,935
And if she found out,
why would she play dumb and not get mad?

130
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,813
She might be holding back
until she gets concrete evidence.

131
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,981
That can't be.

132
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,193
No woman can stay calm after finding out
about her husband's affair.

133
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,861
They usually go ballistic.

134
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,447
I thought I was hallucinating earlier.

135
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,115
I know the times have changed

136
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,951
but how can she do that
in front of her mother-in-law?

137
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,871
I knew this was something
that will blow up one day,

138
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,914
but my only wish

139
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,501
is for it to happen after I'm gone.
Dear Lord…

140
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,585
Mom!

141
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,902
Mom, what are you doing?

142
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,821
Nothing.

143
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,116
Did something happen?

144
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,661
Nothing happened.

145
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,080
I'll sleep here tonight.

146
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,161
HUSBAND HAVING AN AFFAIR

147
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,664
WIFE DISAPPEARS AFTER TAKING
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF HUSBAND'S AFFAIR

148
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,458
DIVORCE CONSULTATION
AFTER HUSBAND'S AFFAIR

149
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,461
I WANT TO DIVORCE MY CHEATING HUSBAND,
I NEED YOUR ADVICE

150
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,463
COLLECT EVIDENCE ONLY YOU HAVE,
VIDEOS ARE BETTER THAN PHOTOS

151
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,840
SINCE YOUR HUSBAND IS AT FAULT,
LOOK INTO THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY AS WELL

152
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,968
SOME POSTED THE VERDICT TO
THE HUSBAND'S AND ADULTERESS' COMPANY PAGE

153
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,428
DON'T LET THESE COMMENTS SWAY YOU,
GET A CONSULTATION FROM A LAW FIRM

154
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,782
Honey.

155
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,703
Do you know where my black tie is?

156
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,042
Who's funeral is it?

157
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,505
My high school teacher's wife.

158
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,968
He was my math teacher
and he was really good to me.

159
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,596
I wonder how he'll get by alone
at that age.

160
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,226
When will you die?

161
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,565
I just asked you when you will die.

162
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm not sure.

163
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,237
Would you be happy
if I had an answer for that?

164
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,948
I just hope you die before me.

165
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,410
That way you'll avoid
becoming a sad widower

166
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,496
who has to get by all alone at an old age
like your teacher.

167
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,333
Right, thank you for your concern.

168
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,922
So you have been training for a marathon
so you can outlive me.

169
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,841
Let's say that's the reason.

170
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,012
Come home early today.
I have something to tell you.

171
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,025
First, you have to gather evidence.

172
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,819
Getting a photo of them
in the act is best.

173
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,947
A photo of them
going in or out of a motel.

174
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,910
The most indisputable evidence
would be a picture of them having sex,

175
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,411
But those are hard to capture.

176
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,624
Once you begin divorce proceedings,
you'll see your husband at his worst.

177
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,751
Simply put, it's a dirty fight.

178
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,796
What if…

179
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,133
I just want a clean divorce?

180
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,219
There is no such thing as a clean divorce.

181
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,281
DIVORCE SPECIALIST, LAW FIRM

182
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,527
Why aren't you running?

183
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,821
Everything…

184
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,824
just seems useless.

185
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,871
What's the point of running?

186
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,373
What's the point of eating?

187
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,418
What's the point of breathing?

188
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,296
It all seems pointless

189
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,382
and makes me feel empty.

190
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,010
Did something happen?

191
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,770
I think I've fallen in love
with marathons.

192
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,025
Where did they go?

193
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,735
They left me out!

194
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,448
We're almost there.

195
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,283
-You've got this!
-I've got this.

196
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,913
Nothing is without reason.

197
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,291
Every effect has a cause.

198
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,886
Dr. Cha, do you want
to be a medical volunteer?

199
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,849
A medical volunteer?

200
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,520
Our hospital regularly provides
free medical services to communities.

201
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,647
I'm going to participate.

202
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,649
You should join me.

203
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,574
She wants to talk?

204
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,660
What does she want to talk about with us?

205
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,036
I don't know.

206
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,579
Jung-min, do you know anything?

207
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,291
How do you expect me to know
something you don't

208
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,875
when you're the one who caused this mess?

209
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,586
I-rang, you didn't tell your mom, did you?

210
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,796
Do you think I'm crazy?

211
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,631
Jeez, then what on earth is it?

212
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,813
I am…

213
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,775
going to leave this house.

214
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,282
"Leave this house"?

215
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:06,992
I mean,

216
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,828
what are you saying all of a sudden?

217
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,581
I'm planning to stay
in the resident dorms.

218
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,917
I'm busy with work as is
and commuting takes up too much time.

219
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,421
I-rang, I hope you can understand.

220
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,674
Does Mother's or my opinion not matter?

221
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,886
You're going to leave
if I-rang is okay with it?

222
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,304
Yes.

223
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,099
I'll be fine,
so do whatever's comfortable for you.

224
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,768
Oh, my.

225
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,603
Then who will do the household chores?

226
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,607
Listen. I can't look after this house
all by myself.

227
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,568
And I'm not satisfied
with any of the housekeepers!

228
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,278
Mother, I'm also exhausted.

229
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:50,077
Either find a housekeeper that you like
or lower your standards.

230
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,628
But you'll still come
on the weekends, right?

231
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,807
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

232
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,985
Dr. Cha, do you want
to be a medical volunteer?

233
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,335
Aren't you going to the dorms next week?

234
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,545
I'll be volunteering.

235
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,756
I'll be busy,
so I thought I'd leave early.

236
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,675
You're going to be a medical volunteer?

237
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,219
-Why all of a sudden?
-Just because.

238
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,472
I wanted to get out
of the hospital for a bit.

239
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,895
Are you moving abroad or what?
Why are you packing so much stuff?

240
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,730
How do you expect to move all of this?

241
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,776
-Do you want me to help?
-No, I called a taxi.

242
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,170
-Let me carry that for you.
-It's fine.

243
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,549
Goodbye, Mother.

244
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,012
Please look after I-rang for me.

245
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,014
She's all grown up.
There's not much for me to do for her.

246
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,767
I'll get going now.

247
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,061
-Bye.
-Okay.

248
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,740
Something feels so off.

249
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,158
What is it?

250
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,412
I have a feeling
she will never come back here.

251
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,872
What?

252
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,351
What are you doing?

253
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,687
I haven't gotten off work on time
in a while, so I'm reading comics.

254
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,105
What's up?

255
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,942
I'm free right now.
Do you want to grab coffee together?

256
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,319
We saw each other all day at work today.

257
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,445
You like me that much?

258
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,697
You just realized that?

259
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,869
If you put it like that, I can't say no.

260
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,663
Hurry up and come out. I miss you.

261
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,165
-Okay, I'm hanging up.
-Okay.

262
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,675
Dr. Cha, why are you coming out of there?

263
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,095
Is there a reason why I can't?

264
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,224
I'm only coming out of this resident dorm
as a resident like you.

265
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,976
I mean, I…

266
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,062
I live far, so I'm staying here
for the time being.

267
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,690
It seems we live across from each other.

268
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,985
I look forward
to being neighbors with you.

269
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,153
Sure.

270
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,427
You must be going to the cafe.

271
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,095
Yes.

272
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,180
Are you going to the cafe?

273
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,683
Yes, I have something to buy.

274
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,605
-Jung-min, keep up the good work.
-Okay, bye.

275
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,858
-Hey.
-Hey.

276
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,204
I see they arranged to meet here.

277
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,167
Hello, Dr. Cha.

278
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:08,835
Hello.

279
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,379
Did you choose my coffee?

280
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,633
Right, a cup of Americano.

281
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,469
Hey, I said I wanted something sweet.

282
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,762
What?

283
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,848
Right, then a dolce latte?

284
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,516
What? Dolce?

285
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,851
Forget it.

286
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,269
-I'll--
-Just drink it, will you?

287
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,570
Did you say that to me?

288
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,866
Hey.

289
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,992
Hey!

290
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,790
Honey, where's my luggage…

291
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,634
-These are the masks, right?
-Yes, 100 of them.

292
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,344
-What about the IV drips?
-Those…

293
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,428
Hurry up and come.

294
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,888
-Hurry.
-We need to check the quantity.

295
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,640
We received 100 masks.

296
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,808
-Write that down.
-I did!

297
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,478
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
MEDICAL AID SUPPLIES

298
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,438
I'll get that.

299
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,315
Thank you.

300
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,068
-The masks? You can put them in.
-I'll do that.

301
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,369
Hello, Director.

302
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,287
You're here.

303
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,415
The talented people of this hospital

304
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,417
have come together for a good cause.

305
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,836
I should be here
to see you off as the director.

306
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,172
Even though I'm staying behind,
I shall be with you in spirit.

307
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,549
Your spirit can stay behind too.

308
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,847
Okay, everyone be careful
and I'll see you when you get back.

309
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,390
Okay.

310
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,020
Mom, where are you?

311
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,315
I'm going to pick some mugwort
with Ms. Ji from church.

312
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,403
Jeez, why are you going to pick mugwort
when you have a bad shoulder?

313
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,197
I have to keep moving it
for it to get better.

314
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,534
Right, you're not
at the hospital today, right?

315
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,995
Yes, I'm going elsewhere
for volunteer work.

316
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,832
Since you're going to go do a good thing,
have a good time and return safely.

317
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,126
You be careful too, okay?

318
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,378
Okay, I'll see you when you get back.

319
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,379
Okay.

320
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,092
-Ms. Oh Deok-rye.
-Yes.

321
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,761
-Please come this way.
-Okay.

322
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,765
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

323
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,436
-What time is it right now?
-I'm not sure.

324
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,480
-We'll arrive around three or four.
-You said you have it.

325
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,106
-Seriously.
-Sit in the front.

326
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,649
-Are you okay?
-I was confused.

327
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,942
-We bought our own.
-What?

328
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,838
-Are you checking everything?
-I'm doing it right now.

329
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,717
-Professor Seo, can I sit here?
-Can I sit here?

330
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,642
-Chief Lim, you sit here.
-You sit.

331
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,854
-What is this?
-What?

332
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:15,814
-What's what?
-What is?

333
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,024
-Why are you blocking me?
-You blocked yourself.

334
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,442
-Why are you picking a fight?
-Who is?

335
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,361
-Let's not talk.
-But we already did.

336
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,823
Jeez, honestly.

337
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,509
-Hello.
-Hello.

338
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,719
-Hello.
-Come on in.

339
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,137
Hello.

340
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,313
Hello.

341
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,360
When can we leave?

342
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,864
I think our department is all here.

343
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:08,992
You're late.

344
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,911
I unintentionally overslept.

345
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,746
Is everyone here?

346
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,291
It takes about two hours to get there,

347
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,917
so you should get some sleep.

348
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,002
I think I'll do that.

349
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,379
Then we'll get going now.

350
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,089
-Okay!
-Okay.

351
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,690
We're here. Everyone can get off now.

352
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,609
I'm hungry. What's for dinner?

353
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,611
Dinner should be pork belly.

354
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,863
Sir, you didn't have
to come out to greet us.

355
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,740
-Thank you for coming again this year.
-Thank you.

356
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,491
We'll work hard this year as well.

357
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,576
Thank you.

358
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,456
Thank you.

359
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,541
Sir, thank you.

360
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,174
Dear Seopgyo-ri residents,
this is the village head speaking.

361
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,136
Just as previously announced,
the doctors from Gusan University Hospital

362
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:14,265
have come here
to offer free medical services for us.

363
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,809
We will work hard to protect
the health of the elderly.

364
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,977
Thank you so much.

365
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,564
Can you organize these and these?

366
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,525
Then I'll bring over everything
organized by each department.

367
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,324
The blood samples are here.

368
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,534
-Put it up here, please.
-Thank you.

369
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,703
-Shall I take these out?
-Yes.

370
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,621
Thank you.

371
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,294
-Hyun-seok, they're calling you there.
-Okay.

372
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,467
All right.

373
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,053
All the medical staff
going on house calls,

374
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,638
please gather in front
of the main building!

375
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,264
I'll go!

376
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,310
I didn't register for that.

377
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,231
What?

378
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,566
Please talk into my ear.

379
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:10,238
Ma'am, I heard that your knees hurt a lot.

380
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,658
That's just because death
is right around the corner for me.

381
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,120
Still, I want to make you feel less pain.

382
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,371
Thank you.

383
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,082
Ma'am,

384
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:27,130
we're going to give you this shot.
It'll help lessen the pain.

385
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,633
If it comes out to 350
2 hours after you've had lunch,

386
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,593
then it means it's not regulating well.

387
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,724
Sir, things have gotten worse
than before, right?

388
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,476
They say it's because of my diabetes,
but it keeps growing black.

389
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,271
Sir, you take insulin, right?

390
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,188
Yes.

391
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,941
-Where do you store it?
-One moment, where did I put it?

392
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,987
There it is, over there.

393
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,114
Yes, that one.

394
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,579
Sir, you have to store insulin
in the fridge.

395
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,456
Are you taking your medicine on time?

396
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:06,044
Well, there's no one here to remind me,
so I forget from time to time.

397
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:10,965
Where is she going?

398
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,635
What's all this?

399
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,889
-What?
-Sir, I'll clean your foot for you.

400
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,015
It's fine.

401
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,266
It's okay. Please stay still.

402
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,684
Gosh, I feel so bad.

403
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,561
This is what we came here for.

404
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,397
Goodness, okay.

405
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:27,940
Gosh.

406
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,735
Gosh, I'm sorry for making you do this.

407
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,903
It's nothing.

408
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,906
It's fine. You can stop.

409
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,412
-Thank you.
-No problem.

410
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,455
Thank you.

411
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,666
Sir, I put your insulin pen in the fridge.

412
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,376
Make sure to get the shots on time.

413
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,963
I also organized your medication here,

414
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,966
so please make sure
you take them after your meals.

415
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,176
Okay.

416
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,470
Sir, please show me your foot again.

417
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,721
My foot, what for?

418
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,349
I want to compare it the next time I come.

419
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,561
I mean,

420
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,606
are you really going to come here again?

421
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,488
Gosh, it's fine if you don't come.

422
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,199
I'll come.

423
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,536
Sir, I'll come back no matter what.

424
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,541
Sir, do you have your meals on time?

425
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,418
Meals? I just…

426
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,143
Sir, please make sure to eat dinner.

427
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,102
Stay healthy.

428
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,311
I'll come again.

429
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,229
Goodbye.

430
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,318
Dr. Cha, you're really amazing.

431
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,281
I didn't even think of washing his foot.

432
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,744
I feel like doctors
who lack skills like me

433
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,665
can still be useful around here.

434
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,877
What a relief, isn't it?

435
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,676
What seems to be bothering you?

436
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,720
-My knee aches.
-Let's check it.

437
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,431
-I hurt it while working.
-Put your leg up here.

438
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,725
-Lift it slowly.
-Okay.

439
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,852
What about your knee?

440
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,563
-It aches.
-Yes, and it makes your heart ache too.

441
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,315
MEDICAL VOLUNTEER EVENT
WITH GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

442
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,316
It's piles.

443
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,442
What are piles?

444
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,111
Simply put, they're hemorrhoids.

445
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,740
But you can only make a full recovery
from hemorrhoids through surgery.

446
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,951
-What?
-But your case is not that serious, sir.

447
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,411
Then what do I do?

448
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,663
I'll prescribe you some medicine.

449
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,416
Drink a lot of water
and eat a lot of vegetables.

450
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,084
-Ye-seo.
-Yes?

451
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,296
I'm going to prescribe a suppository,
so please teach him how to insert it.

452
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,382
SURGICAL DEPARTMENT

453
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,803
Ma'am, you'll have to refrain
from spicy and greasy foods for a while.

454
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,890
-Okay.
-I'll prescribe medicine for diarrhea.

455
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,059
While you're here,
you can get a nutrition injection.

456
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:15,566
Doctor, you are just
as handsome as an actor.

457
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,904
It'd be so nice to introduce you
to my youngest daughter.

458
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,531
How old is your youngest daughter?

459
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,618
Yes, she's 52.

460
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:29,288
She lost her husband two years ago,
but it would be difficult, right?

461
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,749
Yes, it would be kind of difficult.

462
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,351
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO

463
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,943
Your call cannot be connected.
Redirecting to voicemail…

464
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,029
Oh, my. Hello.

465
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:08,286
I received a checkup from you last time.

466
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:13,958
I had that black mole on my back
and you did a biopsy.

467
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,835
Right, hello.

468
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,919
Hello.

469
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,462
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

470
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:24,969
One or two months ago,
my shoulder started hurting badly,

471
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,430
so I came
to the Orthopedic Department here.

472
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,433
Going to neighborhood clinics
didn't seem to help at all.

473
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,436
I see, but you came alone?

474
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,398
I thought my daughter would worry too much
if she knew, so I came in secret.

475
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,942
You seem very close with your daughter.

476
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,695
It's always like that
between a mother and daughter.

477
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,654
I'm jealous.

478
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,574
My mother passed away early.

479
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,327
She passed away when I was in high school.

480
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,661
After giving birth to my own child,

481
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:55,499
I now understand how hard it must've been
for my mother to leave me.

482
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,376
Goodness, I'm sorry to hear that.

483
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,716
I'm sure she watched over you
as you grew up

484
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,594
to be this beautiful and talented.

485
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,349
Even after they die, mothers never leave
their children's side.

486
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,312
Your daughter is lucky.

487
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,105
That's not true.

488
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,192
Well…

489
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,777
to be honest,

490
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,613
my daughter is a doctor too.

491
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,073
Goodness, really?

492
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,159
She is doing her residency
in Family Medicine.

493
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,662
Which hospital?
Is she working for our hospital?

494
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,459
No. At another hospital.

495
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,589
Make sure to receive
treatment for your shoulder.

496
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,717
If it doesn't get better,
you can have it checked by our department.

497
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,011
Thank you, Professor.

498
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,403
-Professor Choi Seung-hi?
-Yes, who are you?

499
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,367
I'm Professor Seo In-ho's mother.

500
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,745
Do you remember me?

501
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,335
You sure have guts.

502
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,462
Why did you do it?

503
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,591
Even with the support of your parents,
siblings, and husband,

504
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,926
it's hard to raise a child.

505
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,388
But you have spent the best years
of your life raising a child.

506
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,601
It's embarrassing to interfere like this
given that my son is almost 50.

507
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,771
But please end this now.

508
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,316
-Mother.
-Don't call me that.

509
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,693
Whether I like it or not,

510
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,028
Jeong-suk is my one and only
daughter-in-law.

511
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,739
Wait.

512
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,583
She's beautiful.

513
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,501
You raised her well.

514
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,712
You worked hard.

515
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,006
But still,

516
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,592
I'll pretend I didn't see that photo.

517
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,126
Your abdomen is very tight
and filled with gas.

518
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,378
I think you threw up due to indigestion.

519
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,715
I'll give you digestive pills
and please refrain from eating today.

520
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,883
Okay, thank you.

521
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:54,386
It's an emergency!

522
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,846
Isn't that the village head?

523
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,764
-What's going on?
-Doctors!

524
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,975
Please save my father!

525
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,520
-It's an emergency!
-Goodness.

526
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:07,066
It's been about three months.
His face is sallow.

527
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,485
It sounds like it'll be a tough job.

528
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,779
Professor Seo, I think you should…

529
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,990
Professor Seo, you'll have to go.

530
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,037
-Me?
-The patient's condition

531
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,288
is your specialty.

532
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,998
-That's right.
-Of course.

533
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,335
I mean, where did all the residents
from our department go?

534
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:29,296
Doctor! Please save my father.

535
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,631
-I beg you!
-Please get up.

536
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,634
Professor Seo, you're perfect for this.

537
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,595
-It's your specialty.
-Aren't we in the same department?

538
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,972
You specialize in the anus.

539
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,474
-We're in the same department, Chief.
-I'm the person in charge here.

540
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,935
-Thank you!
-What is there to oversee here?

541
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,311
There's nothing to oversee here.

542
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,313
-Hang on. Don't push me.
-Go on then.

543
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,389
Are we here? It must be here.

544
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,183
No, we have to walk from here
because there's no path.

545
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,314
-What?
-I feel bad for putting you through this.

546
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,524
It's fine.

547
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,735
Which way is it? Down there?

548
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,945
No, it's just a short hike up there.

549
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:35,904
Follow me.

550
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,751
This place is pretty nice, right?

551
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,793
-Yes!
-Doctor, here.

552
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:50,794
Okay.

553
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,092
Doctor, please help an old man out.

554
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,762
Father will die at this rate.

555
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,680
How long has it been?

556
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,309
Father, how long has it been
since you had a bowel movement?

557
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,854
I stopped counting after eight days.

558
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,190
We tried everything in the pharmacy,

559
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,399
but nothing worked.

560
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,401
Doctor, what should we do?

561
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,698
Do you have petroleum jelly at home?

562
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,327
All I wanted was to poop.
Why are you making me take a sitz bath?

563
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,787
I don't even have hemorrhoids.

564
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,165
He said if your muscles relax,
you might be able to poop.

565
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,335
He says to come out because he's ready.

566
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:41,595
Sir, lay on top of the newspaper
and bring your knees to your chest.

567
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,138
How?

568
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,271
This position. Just like a shrimp.

569
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,956
Sir, brace yourself.
It will be a little uncomfortable.

570
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,917
Uncomfortable?
It can't be worse than now, right?

571
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,382
It'll be very uncomfortable.
Hang in there.

572
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,759
I feel so bad for you. I'm sorry.

573
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,219
It's fine.

574
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,180
It's very hard.

575
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,974
Is something coming out?

576
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,058
I'm digging it out.

577
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,310
It's coming out.

578
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,906
Father, do you feel refreshed?

579
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,577
I feel so light. I feel as if I could fly.

580
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,373
Doctor, the way
you twirled your fingers around

581
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,876
must have stimulated his butthole.

582
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,212
He was able to feel refreshed
all thanks to you.

583
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:01,508
-It was nothing.
-This is the happiest I've been lately.

584
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,552
Thank you, Doctor.

585
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,929
Yes, I'm grateful that I was able to help.

586
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,182
Doctor, you worked so hard.
Please have a drink.

587
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,684
The work hours will be over anyway
by the time you go down.

588
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,232
Shall I?

589
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,452
Please check Mr. Jung Seung-ho's IV drip
and shots one more time.

590
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,453
Yes, ma'am.

591
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,963
Enjoy.

592
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,715
-You worked hard.
-Thank you.

593
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,009
-Dr. Dong-keun.
-Yes.

594
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,565
That's hot!

595
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,152
I was lost in thought.

596
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,497
What were you thinking about?

597
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:14,998
What?

598
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,584
You seemed to be preoccupied
with something for a while.

599
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:20,754
Was I?

600
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,007
You can tell me if things are tough.

601
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,968
Don't bottle it up.

602
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,846
What do you think you're doing right now?

603
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,561
I'm fine now. Thank you.

604
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,280
You little…

605
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,657
I'm sorry.

606
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,746
-What is his deal?
-Goodness.

607
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,833
-So many things need garlic.
-Just do it!

608
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,251
What is this smell?

609
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,210
-Hey.
-Yes?

610
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,545
Did you fart?

611
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,671
I didn't!

612
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,994
I don't smell anything.

613
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,750
Have I become too used
to the smell of poop?

614
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,593
EUN-SEO

615
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:50,552
119 AMBULANCE

616
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,179
Okay. Please come up.

617
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,478
Your call cannot be connected.
Redirecting to voicemail…

618
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,520
DAD

619
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,938
Get in quickly.

620
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,196
Don't put that on me.

621
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,740
It's not a cardiac problem.

622
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:12,908
It's gastric cramps.

623
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,701
I'm a doctor, so I know.

624
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,286
We'll go to Gusan University Hospital.

625
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,454
No!

626
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,707
Take me to a different hospital.

627
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,751
Mom, are you okay?

628
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:24,920
Yes.

629
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,798
Professor, try this.

630
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:30,926
How is it?

631
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,304
-I think you can add more soybean paste.
-Right?

632
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,563
Can you taste it again for me?

633
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,027
It's perfect.

634
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,253
I guess you learned
how to cook professionally.

635
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,254
It's a survival skill.

636
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,423
If you're a healthy adult,

637
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,300
you should know how to cook your own food.

638
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:20,809
You must be very close to Dr. Cha.
You even sat next to her on the bus.

639
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,564
My wife is very sociable, isn't she?

640
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,608
Are you going to reveal the truth?

641
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,068
About you and her?

642
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:37,743
I guess not.

643
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,163
Of course not.

644
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,751
-I'll take care of it myself.
-I'm sure you will.

645
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:51,339
If you are free, can you make some sauce
for the meat with that soybean paste?

646
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,092
-Sauce?
-You do know how to make it, right?

647
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,347
Of course.

648
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,391
That's a piece of cake.

649
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,233
-Gosh!
-Goodness!

650
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,529
What a waste!

651
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,782
What do we do?

652
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:19,075
My mother-in-law fermented
that paste for three years!

653
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,786
Your clothes are ruined.

654
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:24,039
Why did you butt in
when you don't even know how to make it?

655
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,543
-Darn, I didn't bring extra clothes.
-I'll give you clothes.

656
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,586
Ones that are pretty.

657
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,254
Give me that! Goodness.

658
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,089
What a waste.

659
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,050
We can't even put this back in!

660
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,676
-Unbelievable.
-Such a waste.

661
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,844
But it tastes good.

662
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,263
It's such a waste. What do we do?

663
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,848
Clean this up!

664
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,186
With my hands?

665
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,779
All right!

666
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,448
Doctors, since you've worked
so hard today,

667
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,409
as the village head,
I shall supply you with drinks.

668
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,036
Our village head is the best!

669
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,997
-Sir, what is that?
-Makgeolli!

670
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,666
Have you never seen this before?

671
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,383
-Gosh.
-Sir, thank you.

672
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,300
It's nothing.

673
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,886
Professor Seo. I mean, Ma'am.

674
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,304
I'll pour you one.

675
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:25,976
I'm fine.

676
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,979
I drank a lot at the village head's house.

677
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:33,108
You know it's my principle
not to get wasted.

678
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,318
That's my principle…

679
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,696
How can you decline a drink
at a party like this?

680
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,283
Don't you think you are hurting
this makgeolli's ego and pride?

681
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,243
You don't have surgery tomorrow.
Just drink.

682
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,662
You have no self-control.

683
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,290
How on earth
did you practice medicine in such a state?

684
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,750
What did you just say?

685
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,711
Did you not hear me?
Do you want me to repeat myself?

686
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,671
I didn't hear you.
Repeat it five times for me.

687
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,839
Please pour me a drink.

688
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,174
I'm a heavy drinker.

689
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,677
You should always accept
your senior's drink.

690
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,596
That lousy principle of yours.

691
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,473
My principle is to drink
all the alcohol there is.

692
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,687
Give me a drink.

693
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,689
That's more like it. Here you go, Ma'am.

694
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,232
Come on, seriously?

695
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,526
He said he doesn't want to drink. Stop it!

696
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,614
Don't yell at me when I'm this close.
I can hear you!

697
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,828
But why is there bad blood
between our chief

698
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,164
and the chief of the surgical department?

699
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,792
Apparently, they were
super close during college.

700
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,378
They were so close
that the chief of Family Medicine

701
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,298
introduced his younger sister
to the chief of the surgical department.

702
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,257
And?

703
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,260
You punk, I knew the moment
you betrayed my little sister

704
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,430
and married the daughter of a rich family.

705
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,766
-You'll get your comeuppance someday.
-"You'll get your comeuppance someday."

706
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,434
I'm so sick of hearing that line.

707
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,270
Is it my fault that Bong-suk
grew old all alone?

708
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:56,650
You and I will be 60 soon.
That's 21,900 days old.

709
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,985
-Aren't you ashamed?
-What, you punk?

710
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,780
Don't call me a punk.
I'm too old to be called that.

711
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,160
-What's with you?
-They're basically the same.

712
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,079
Both of their wives divorced them.

713
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,789
Forget it. Let's drink.

714
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,874
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

715
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,627
-Great work today, everyone.
-You drink.

716
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,464
Imagine how happy this makgeolli would be
to be loved like this?

717
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,841
That's it. Imagine how happy it would be.

718
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:27,097
-That's the spirit, Professor Seo.
-Have another.

719
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,348
Yes, sir.

720
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,557
Here's another one.

721
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,603
There you go.

722
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,023
That's it.

723
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,402
You'll reach your goal.

724
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,198
Alcohol got the best of you.

725
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,326
Why did you drink so much?

726
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,296
-I'm going to go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

727
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,591
I'm getting a call.

728
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,218
Hello, Mom?

729
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,053
What did you say?

730
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,513
Right now, I'm…

731
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,057
-Yes.
-He's holding his phone upside down.

732
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,322
Those little…

733
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:27,991
What?

734
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,829
-My legs are all cramped, gosh.
-That quiet person

735
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,917
Who kept moving farther away

736
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,210
I guess there's a karaoke machine.

737
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,214
Even if we cannot meet

738
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,383
Don't forget about me

739
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,052
-Don't forget about me!
-Don't forget about me!

740
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:51,347
I loved you

741
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,684
Chief Yoon, you're so good-looking.
You're the best.

742
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,811
Chief Yoon, you're so cute.
Thank you so much.

743
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,522
Everyone, come on out here.

744
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,067
We should dance and sing
with the people here.

745
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,485
Professor Seo, come on!

746
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,363
Rohan Kimberley.
I mean, Roy Kimberley, come here!

747
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,369
On the last train…

748
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,913
Are you okay?

749
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,374
Do you want to lie down inside?

750
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,126
Shall I take you there?

751
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,463
Do you want to throw up?

752
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:27,008
And my tears fall as well…

753
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:27,967
It's 89168…

754
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,177
What?

755
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,887
89168…

756
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,722
What did you say?

757
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,309
Within my

758
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:41,689
-Vague memory
-It's 89168!

759
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,027
My lover I met there

760
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,447
My wordless lover

761
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,869
She keeps going further away from me

762
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:03,336
-Number 89168!
-Do not forget me though we cannot meet…

763
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,175
I can actually see the stars.

764
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,094
I know.

765
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,556
I finally don't have
to look at the hospital ceiling.

766
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,266
It's making me emotional.

767
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,393
You said you didn't want to come.

768
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:19,978
But it's nice, right?

769
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,313
Whatever.

770
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,692
Didn't you say you took a video
of a Whipple procedure you went into?

771
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,235
Show it to me.

772
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,736
I just don't understand.

773
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,864
Do you want to watch that here?

774
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,074
Yes, I do.

775
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,368
Come on. Show me.

776
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,497
-Here.
-Okay.

777
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,291
Thank you.

778
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,172
So this is how you do it?

779
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,840
Did I drink too much makgeolli?

780
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,425
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

781
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,302
Come back soon.

782
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,183
He should have the other video too.

783
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:04,355
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

784
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,734
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

785
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:12,322
-Happy birthday, dear my wife
-Happy birthday, dear Jeong-suk

786
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,910
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

787
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,297
-Real, real, real, real, it's real
-Real, real, real, real, it's real

788
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,759
-It's the real deal
-It's the real deal

789
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:38,097
-I will love you really deeply
-I will love you really deeply

790
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,935
-I will
-I will

791
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,772
-Love you really deeply
-Love you really deeply

792
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,659
Hey.

793
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,005
Honey!

794
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,393
What? Who is he calling "honey"?

795
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,103
"Honey" as in his love?

796
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:36,447
Honey! Come here.

797
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,199
Sing a song

798
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,619
with me!

799
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,466
DOCTOR CHA

800
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,073
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk is your mother?

801
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,117
Is it true? She's your wife?

802
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,201
Why aren't you doing anything?

803
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,829
I'll be working
in Family Medicine starting tomorrow.

804
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,372
I look forward to working with you.

805
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,459
I think the time is coming
to make a decision.

806
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,501
You crazy brat!

807
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,173
If I tell you,
you'll be in a difficult position.

808
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:39,052
I can't even believe it
because it feels too unreal.

809
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:44,766
