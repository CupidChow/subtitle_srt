00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,457
BEAUTIFUL DERMATOLOGY

3
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,416
Hello.

4
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,418
Hello.

5
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,841
BEAUTIFUL DERMATOLOGY
DIRECTOR

6
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,970
What are you doing?

7
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,475
-Good morning.
-At this rate, you might put it on me.

8
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,728
Coats these days look so refined.

9
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,730
-What color is this?
-Give that to me. I'll wear it myself.

10
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,066
Goodness, I'll put it on for you.

11
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,734
Gosh, jeez.

12
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,321
Filming finished late,
so I barely made it here on time.

13
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,906
Gosh, you're so cool.

14
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,159
You go to broadcasting stations
and get filmed.

15
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,536
Why are you all dressed up?

16
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,080
Are you going on a blind date
or something?

17
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,833
I use days like this
as an excuse to dress up.

18
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,334
How do you like it? It's brand new.

19
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,295
Regardless, the face is
what completes a look.

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,256
What happened to your face?

21
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,343
What do you mean?
I really worked hard on my makeup today.

22
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,761
Let's go. Let's drink coffee.

23
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,763
Jeez, that cold-hearted woman.

24
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,974
I look pretty.

25
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,352
Gosh.

26
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:28,398
My friend, I keep telling you to come
to get treatments before it gets worse.

27
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,566
Why won't you listen?

28
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,026
It doesn't look good
to get free treatments for being a friend.

29
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,320
Then you can just pay for it.

30
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,823
Your mother-in-law is over 70,

31
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,409
and she comes here
more often than to the grocery store.

32
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,371
Hey, my mother-in-law
has always lived that kind of lifestyle.

33
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,957
Hey, do I look that awful?

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,168
Yes. Are you not eating well?

35
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,045
I mean, your face seems yellowish.

36
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,923
-What?
-And your eyes look a little jaundiced.

37
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,174
What?

38
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,012
I'm just tired.

39
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,139
I haven't been feeling well
the past few days.

40
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,265
Jeez.

41
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,311
Hey, that's that.
Do you have any good news these days?

42
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,563
-What good news?
-You have everything

43
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,689
but marriage.

44
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,442
Marriage, my foot. That's so ridiculous.

45
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,528
-Stop trying to be funny.
-You'll be a virgin forever at this rate.

46
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,866
Honestly, on that subject,
aren't you purer than me?

47
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,075
It's been over ten years

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,120
since you and your husband
started sleeping in separate rooms.

49
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,915
Doesn't that practically make you
a born-again virgin?

50
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,791
You little…

51
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,003
Listen, the love between a married couple

52
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,506
isn't always maintained
through physical aspects.

53
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,842
It's a world of complexities
and subtleties

54
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,220
that a spinster like you
wouldn't know about.

55
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,222
Fine, you can spend the rest of your life

56
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,683
having your heart flutter
at even the sight of your husband.

57
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,269
You'll be like that little girl Candy
from that romantic series.

58
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,566
Hey, let's tackle those freckles first.

59
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,613
You're such a mess.
It's hard to know where to start.

60
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,243
Let's go, Ms. Cha Candy.

61
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,410
Come on.

62
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,038
Most people throw a fit
because they couldn't become a doctor,

63
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,958
so why did you choose
to become a full-time housewife?

64
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,627
Don't you think it's a waste
of your medical license? I'm done.

65
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,174
I don't think it's a waste at all.

66
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,011
While you were diligently looking after
your patients and starting this clinic,

67
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,264
do you think I was just relaxing at home?

68
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,850
I gave birth to two kids and raised them
into proper human beings.

69
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,020
You've worked hard to study medicine

70
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,356
and used it to work
to create a great life for yourself.

71
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,109
But isn't raising
two human beings like I did

72
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,612
future-oriented and a contribution
to the development of this country?

73
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,990
Candy's leaving.

74
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,907
Hey, are you mad?

75
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,245
-I'm fine.
-You are mad. Jeong-suk…

PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC, CLINIC

Most people throw a fit
because they couldn't become a doctor,

81
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,789
so why did you choose
to become a full-time housewife?

82
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,126
Don't you think
it's a waste of your medical license?

83
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,096
Goodness. Young man, are you okay?

84
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,098
Try to breathe. Someone help!

85
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,101
Someone help! Is there a doctor here?

86
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,978
Are there no doctors here?

87
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,980
There's no doctor?

88
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,567
I'm a doctor…

89
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,236
Here! This person said she's a doctor!

90
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,988
There's a doctor!

91
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,531
-Save him.
-No.

92
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,325
What I meant was…

93
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,452
Gosh.

94
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,421
Give me this. Lift your head.

95
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,845
Sir, hang in there.

96
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,984
Intubation.

97
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,700
Call 911!

98
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,121
Come on, wake up, sir!

99
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,081
We need an ambulance!

100
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,375
Driver, stop!

101
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,550
We're going to transfer him
to a nearby hospital.

102
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,592
You may not be his guardian,

103
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,761
but we heard you're a doctor.
Could you come with us?

104
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,140
Isn't that lady a little weird?

105
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,433
Right? She said she was a doctor,

106
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,061
but did you see her hands tremble
in front of the guy?

107
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,813
We have to get going quickly.

108
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,481
Yes, I'll go.

109
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,701
SEOMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
DOCTOR ROY KIM

110
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,245
I'm a surgeon. I'll go with you too.

111
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,255
The LMA won't go in
because of his swollen airway.

112
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,423
What should we do?

113
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,508
Please help me. What should we do?

114
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,427
Doctor.

115
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,553
Step aside.

116
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,097
Sir.

117
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,310
He has a pulse.
We need to do a tracheotomy.

118
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,311
Okay.

119
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,275
Please give me an antiseptic.

120
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,162
Bag, please.

121
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,635
Sir, are you awake?

122
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,429
If you can hear my voice,
please move your hand.

123
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,356
My goodness, Doctor! It worked!

124
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,445
God, thank you so much!
You did so great, Doctor!

125
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,407
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

126
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,618
Excuse me,
but what line of work are you in?

127
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,078
Sorry?

128
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,038
I heard you said you were a doctor.

129
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,333
Yes.

130
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,459
You shouldn't do that.

131
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,129
It's illegal for non-medical personnel
to practice medicine.

132
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,047
Well,

133
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,050
I know you may not believe this,

134
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,428
but I am a doctor.

135
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,307
The thing is,
I haven't practiced for over 20 years,

136
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,603
so my mind went blank
when I came upon that situation.

137
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,814
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,402
Today is such a great day

139
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,738
since that patient met you.

140
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,200
You were really impressive.

141
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,788
Then I'll get going first.

142
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,384
What's the topic
for this week's conference?

143
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,720
It's robotic surgery
for low rectal cancer.

144
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,765
Professor, what should we do
for the patient, Na Tae-gyeong?

145
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,850
Monitor the Hemovac

146
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,019
and ask the Psychiatry Department
about his depression.

147
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,061
Yes, sir.

148
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,899
Professor, for tomorrow's conference,

149
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,027
should the first case be Jeon Sang-hyeok?

150
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,280
No, put Kim Jae-hui's surgery
as the first case.

151
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,698
Yes, sir.

152
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,498
-You can go first.
-Okay.

153
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,099
I get shocked every time I see Jung-min

154
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,102
because he looks so much like you
when you were young.

155
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,229
I think I looked better, no?

156
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,774
I think we should be more discreet.

157
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,234
It'll be bad if your son finds out,
don't you think?

158
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,946
-Should we have dinner together?
-I can't. I have plans.

159
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,450
-What kind of plans?
-Why? Do you think it's a date with a man?

160
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,538
-I'm not going to tell you.
-Fine.

161
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,999
I'll go now.

162
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,555
ALARM, GANGNAM SEMINAR
7:00 P.M.

163
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,822
Come on, wake up, sir!

164
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,906
We need an ambulance!

165
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,659
Excuse me,
but what line of work are you in?

166
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,121
-Sorry?
-I heard you said you were a doctor.

167
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,498
-Yes.
-You shouldn't do that.

168
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,001
It's illegal for non-medical personnel
to practice medicine.

169
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,175
Mother, are you getting back
from exercising?

170
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,011
-Yes. You must have just gotten back too.
-Yes.

171
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,181
-Will you make me a glass of detox juice?
-Sure.

172
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,892
I made some earlier and put it
in the fridge. I'll get you a glass.

173
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,896
Jeez, the key to juice is its freshness.
You have to make it fresh on the spot.

174
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,897
I'm sorry, Mother.

175
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,358
I made it in advance
because I had to go out today.

176
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,318
Could you drink it just for today?

177
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,195
-By the way, Mother.
-What?

178
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,781
Thank you for lending me
your clothes and bag today.

179
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,700
-I'll dry-clean the clothes.
-Sure.

180
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,286
I have dinner plans tonight,
so don't worry about making dinner for me.

181
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,579
Okay.

182
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,587
Is Director Baek doing well?

183
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,629
Very well.

184
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,132
-Mother, she treated my freckles today.
-That's good.

185
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,760
The new clinic is two times bigger
than the last one,

186
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,346
and the interior
was designed incredibly well.

187
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,059
So were you incredibly jealous?

188
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,812
Of course, I was jealous.
She even appears on TV.

189
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,855
She's so impressive.

190
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,191
Even if a woman is skilled
and attains fame and prestige,

191
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,943
it means nothing
if she doesn't have a healthy family.

192
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,904
Dr. Baek goes on a vacation
abroad every season, right?

193
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,365
But how can you call that a vacation?
She has no husband and no kids.

194
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,536
She rides on planes and wanders around
the world because she's empty inside.

195
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,748
To put it nicely,
she's a successful career woman,

196
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,583
but just wait ten years.

197
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,210
She'll look sad and pitiful.

198
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,588
You're a hundred times better off.
You have a son and a daughter.

199
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,590
Why are you jealous of her? Goodness.

200
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,602
Rice cooking will now begin.

201
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,384
-Mom.
-Welcome home.

202
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,177
You must be tired.

203
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,264
You didn't even send the fees
for my art academy?

204
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,182
-Right.
-The teacher was pressuring me for them.

205
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,017
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

206
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,603
I forgot because
I was all out of sorts today.

207
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,023
-Tomorrow's the competition, right?
-Yes.

208
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,484
If I win an award this time,

209
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,319
I can apply for Hanguk
and Hongin University.

210
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,196
Goodness, really?

211
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,823
I'm home.

212
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,616
You're home late.

213
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,411
Yes, Father.

214
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,956
Welcome home.
Jung-min, hurry up and come here.

215
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,124
Okay.

216
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,671
I-rang, when is your next mock exam?

217
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,424
It's next Tuesday.

218
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,342
To get into a med school,

219
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,344
you need to be at least
in the top 500 in Korea.

220
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,763
-Okay.
-Gosh.

221
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,475
Mom, you're doing this all by yourself?
You're going to work yourself sick.

222
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,019
It's okay. I can get it done.

223
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,771
You should've taken off the doors
during the day.

224
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,315
I couldn't sleep because of the drilling.

225
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,442
Sorry. I'll finish it up today.

226
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,860
This looks good.

227
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,362
Let's eat.

228
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,615
Jung-min.

229
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,744
Yes, Father.

230
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,704
Doctors have to deal with people.

231
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,499
I know being an intern is hard,
but always maintain a neat look.

232
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,751
That's part of being professional.

233
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,420
Okay.

234
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,714
Have you decided on your specialty?

235
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,135
Yes, it's surgery, of course.

236
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,394
You still have a lot of time.
Think it over before you decide.

237
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,315
No, that way of talking
just makes the kids soft.

238
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,778
People can be a little soft,
and they can be strong too.

239
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,697
They can't all be the same. Eat up.

240
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,367
Only other people's kids can be soft.

241
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,745
They say that you should treat
your kids like you would treat others.

242
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
-Why is the soup like this?
-What?

243
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,672
Why does it taste like this? Oh, no.

244
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,841
I forgot to put any salt in it.

245
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,803
I'll hurry up and season it. Sorry.

246
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,806
Where has your mind wandered off to?
Are you already getting old?

247
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,102
I guess I am.

248
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,982
Did you change the coffee beans?
The taste was weird.

249
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,942
Why? I thought it was good.

250
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,197
I mean, there's a thing called preference.
Not everything can be nice and tasty.

251
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:46,630
Okay, I'll buy a whole bunch
of the coffee beans you like.

252
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,192
Assemblyman, please get home safely.

253
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,903
Would you like to go in now?

254
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,201
It's very strange, isn't it?

255
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,370
Though the times have changed,

256
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,458
women with a lot of talent and abilities
strangely have no luck with men.

257
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,126
Is that what I'm like?

258
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,252
If you were born a man,

259
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,505
your talent would have been great enough
to take you to the very top.

260
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,593
But unfortunately, you were born a woman.

261
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,806
I'm sorry, but you have
the fortune of a mistress.

262
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:43,062
Marriage has no meaning
for people with this kind of fate.

263
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,940
It's a shame this fate never lets you go.

264
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:48,817
I see.

265
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,237
Do you really have
to live with that person?

266
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,908
I want to show them, you see.

267
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,995
People may say it's such a waste for me
to cling to a married man.

268
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,708
But being this foolish and immature
is what makes us human, is it not?

269
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,711
Since you've waited this long,

270
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,548
let's wait a bit more.

271
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,344
A single opportunity may come.

272
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,014
And it will come soon.

273
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,938
I know you don't wear sunglasses
because they bother you.

274
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,900
But the sun is really strong in Europe,
so you have to wear them.

275
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,362
-Okay?
-Okay.

276
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,280
But these are so old.

277
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,366
You need a new pair.

278
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,996
-Honey.
-What is it?

279
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,207
How about sleeping…

280
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,918
in the main bedroom from now on?

281
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,426
You slept in this room
when you'd come home late after surgery,

282
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,471
but that just turned into us
sleeping in separate rooms.

283
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,352
It's not like we don't have needs.

284
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,439
So sleeping in separate rooms
when we're still young doesn't seem right.

285
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,367
Jeez, that's a bit too out of the blue.

286
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,829
Is it?

287
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,372
This is too abrupt.

288
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,424
Right, I got my freckles treated today.
At Mi-hee's clinic.

289
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,177
-My face is still red, right? Look.
-It's really red.

290
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,144
I feel so lethargic these days.

291
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,771
It feels like chronic fatigue.

292
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,732
Then lay down for a bit.

293
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,819
Even a dog would laugh
if it heard someone as lucky as you

294
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,279
say they have chronic fatigue.

295
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,572
It's menopause. Start working out.

296
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,202
Would it kill you to speak nicely to me?

297
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,037
I'm just telling you the facts.

298
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,085
I don't care
whether you wear sunglasses or not.

299
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,129
They're your eyes, not mine.

300
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,784
This style is very popular this season.

301
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,245
I'm looking for a pair for my husband.

302
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,664
I see. In that case,
please wait one moment.

303
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,793
What do you think of these?

304
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,797
Middle-aged men
prefer this kind of style a lot.

305
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,968
-They're nice. I'll take these.
-Okay.

306
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,149
Here you go.

307
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,944
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you okay?

308
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,363
You don't look well.

309
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,369
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

310
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:11,389
Ma'am! Are you all right?

311
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,767
Hurry up and call 911!

312
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,602
Ma'am, are you all right?

313
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,484
-Try these on.
-What?

314
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,573
-They look good. Look in the mirror.
-I already know what they look like.

315
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,159
-You look like a singer.
-I do.

316
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,620
-I'll buy these for you.
-No need. Forget it.

317
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,789
Just say yes before I change my mind.

318
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,834
Honestly. I said it's fine.

319
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,003
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

320
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,841
I'll go pay for these.

321
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,008
Okay.

322
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,391
-Hello?
-What are you doing?

323
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,601
What do you think? Waiting for my flight.

324
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,854
Honey, guess where I am right now.

325
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,648
-What?
-I'm in the emergency room.

326
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,275
Why?

327
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,152
I fainted in the department store.

328
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,319
Who did?

329
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,155
What do you mean "who"?

330
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,323
Me. Your wife.

331
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,494
-Why did you suddenly faint?
-I don't know.

332
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,999
I fainted, and when I woke up,
I was in the emergency room.

333
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,919
The resident here says
my eyes look jaundiced,

334
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,713
so they're running a liver panel.

335
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,882
They just took my blood.

336
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,634
-They told me to contact a guardian.
-One moment.

337
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,346
Jung-min is probably preoccupied
with his internship,

338
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,141
your mother went to a class reunion today,

339
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,517
and you're at the airport.

340
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,060
What should I do?

341
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,479
How do you feel?

342
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,317
I feel a little better after resting.

343
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,030
Is your condition bad enough
that I have to cancel my conference?

344
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:57,746
The test results aren't even back yet,
so you don't have to do that.

345
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,164
We'll wait for the results,

346
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,917
and my mother or your mother can come.

347
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,962
Sure, okay.

348
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,799
-Let me know when the results are out.
-Okay, have a good conference.

349
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,845
It looks like I'm just making you worry
when you're going so far away.

350
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,931
No, it's fine.

351
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
Get some rest.

352
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,080
Ma'am, I'm going
to take your blood one more time.

353
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,501
-Why?
-Your levels are abnormally high.

354
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,758
What's up?

355
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,804
-Who is it?
-Her name is Cha Jeong-suk.

356
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,351
What is this? The results are the same.

357
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,145
The GOT and GPT levels
both came out to over 3,000.

358
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,065
Jeez, it wasn't an issue with the sample.

359
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,693
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk.

360
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,694
Hello.

361
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,196
Normal liver panel levels
come out to under 40,

362
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,490
but right now yours
are coming out as over 3,000.

363
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,452
Does that mean it's acute hepatitis?

364
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,453
You're well aware.

365
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,207
Do I need to be admitted?

366
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,251
Yes. Have you called your guardian?

367
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,794
Do I…

368
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,505
really need a guardian to come?

369
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,465
SEHWA WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY
'70 FRESHMEN REUNION

370
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,301
Goodness, walking on eggshells?

371
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:38,013
I'm the matriarch of the family.
They should walk on eggshells around me.

372
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:43,727
My daughter-in-law still prepares
a lavish meal for me every morning.

373
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,855
Your daughter-in-law deserves an award
for that kind of filial love.

374
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,441
No daughter-in-law
is like that these days.

375
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,569
Smart girls know how to manage a family
when they put their minds to it.

376
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:56,531
Maybe it's because she went to
medical school, but she's really clever.

377
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,159
She's great with the kids' education
and managing the house.

378
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,745
She didn't use a tutor
and taught her kids herself.

379
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,331
And the oldest went to medical school.

380
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:09,044
Isn't it a waste that such a capable woman
only does housework?

381
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,797
Only a struggling household would make
their doctor daughter-in-law work.

382
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,425
Being as well-off as we are,
why send her to work?

383
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,177
When she'd only earn a small amount?

384
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:22,807
It looks like you've saved more money
by not sending her off to work.

385
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,435
Most families spend hundreds of millions

386
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,854
to send their kids to med school.

387
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,444
Hello?

388
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,321
Hello?

389
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,698
It's such a relief

390
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,784
to not be that pretentious woman's in-law.

391
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,036
It's the daughter-in-law I feel bad for.

392
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,662
If I were her daughter-in-law,

393
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,832
I would have probably already come down
with a serious illness.

394
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,210
Emergency room?

395
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,547
I have a spa reservation later too.

396
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,258
Is it something serious?

397
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,229
MOM

398
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,068
Please give me some salt too.

399
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,069
Mom?

400
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,362
Is everything okay?

401
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,364
Yes. Where are you?

402
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,907
I'm at the mill.

403
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,159
I was going to make
rice cakes with mugwort.

404
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,953
You like mugwort rice cakes.

405
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:29,082
Jeez, why make rice cakes?
You can just buy them.

406
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,583
Handmade ones are much better.

407
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,963
The rice cakes in stores have spinach
mixed in to make them seem green.

408
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,465
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

409
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,594
But why does your voice sound so down
when you said you've already eaten?

410
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,681
Mom, then I guess you're off today.

411
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,391
I'm off until tomorrow.

412
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,810
Why? Is something wrong?

413
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,694
If you're that worried,
then just go to the hospital.

414
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,028
What?

415
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,531
It's fine. It's not like she's a kid.

416
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,616
But you feel uneasy.

417
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,787
I have a sense of decency, you know.
How could I just leave you here and go?

418
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,918
But what if it's serious?

419
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,212
Wouldn't it make you
feel better to just go?

420
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,506
What? No, don't worry about it.

421
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,509
But you are worrying about it.

422
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,512
Well, it's hard not to worry
when someone fainted.

423
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:29,142
But it's probably not a big deal,
so let's stop talking about this.

424
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,395
What is this?

425
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,025
I was going to give it to you
on the plane later at night,

426
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,778
but you can just open it.

427
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,537
I'll help you put it on.

428
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,051
Okay, let's be on our way.

429
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,221
Doctor, this patient says

430
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,641
-their neck hurts a lot, but I said…
-Yes.

431
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,850
Tell them they can go home.

432
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,644
Okay, thank you.

433
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,812
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk.

434
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,484
Yes?

435
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,071
A TA patient came in.
Can you please check her status?

436
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:23,988
Okay.

437
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,660
INTERN CHA JEONG-SUK

438
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,418
Hello.

439
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,795
Hello.

440
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,046
Are you feeling okay?

441
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,756
No, my leg hurts so much.

442
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,093
If you get treated and take medication,
you'll get better in no time.

443
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:46,928
Thank you.

444
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,556
If you need anything else,
please let me know.

445
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,473
Okay.

446
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,727
Gosh.

447
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,772
I'm hungry.

448
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,982
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk.

449
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,734
Your IV drip is done.
I'll take it out for you.

450
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,652
Thank you.

451
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,071
Excuse me, where is the convenience store?

452
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,240
-It is on the fifth floor.
-Okay.

453
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,381
Why is the convenience store
on the fifth floor?

454
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,091
I'm hungry.

455
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,431
-Does it hurt?
-Yes, it hurts.

456
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,645
It'll be over soon.

457
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,730
Be more gentle.

458
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,317
-It hurts, gosh.
-Hold on just a little longer.

459
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,821
Excuse me!

460
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,115
You shouldn't do that here.
She's a minor at that!

461
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,205
Oh, my.

462
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,835
Thank you!

463
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,255
You're handsome!

464
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,008
She was riding a motorcycle
with older kids in the neighborhood

465
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,593
and got into an accident.

466
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,969
She tried to leave,
saying she had no money,

467
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,512
but I insisted on treating her.

468
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,474
What did you think I was doing?

469
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,560
I misunderstood the situation…

470
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,687
I'm really sorry.

471
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,443
I guess you can't just walk by
a patient in need.

472
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,404
It was like that time
when you got into the ambulance

473
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,530
and today too.

474
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,617
You see, I'm a decent doctor.

475
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,619
But anyway,

476
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,122
we don't know each other well enough
to say that it's nice to see you again.

477
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,582
What brings you to this hospital?

478
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,379
I was brought into the emergency room

479
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,965
after fainting at a department store.

480
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,634
Are you okay now?

481
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,970
I'm sure I'll be okay.

482
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,806
All right, I have to see outpatients now.

483
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,224
I wish you good luck.

484
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,351
Yes, Doctor. Goodbye.

485
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,821
We run into each other often.

486
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,906
I guess so.

487
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,867
I didn't realize
we'd meet again like this…

488
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,454
We can talk about
this special connection next time.

489
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,164
Is your guardian here?

490
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,292
The thing is, my husband is just so busy…

491
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,503
He should come no matter how busy he is.

492
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,005
The situation isn't good right now.

493
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,841
Is it really bad?

494
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,676
I know you got out of med school long ago,

495
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,054
but you must know how serious it is
when liver panel results are 3,600, right?

496
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,182
Your jaundice level is really high too.

497
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,018
If this leads to liver failure,

498
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,061
then there's no going back.

499
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,314
Call your guardian immediately.

500
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,152
NAME: CHA JEONG-SUK

501
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,787
Gosh, what in the world?

502
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,331
What happened?

503
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,375
Mom.

504
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,798
I just have to stay at the hospital
for a couple of days and rest.

505
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,258
You don't have to worry.

506
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,802
But you have to be admitted,
no matter what?

507
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,972
Yes, they need to confirm
that my liver panel results

508
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,390
and jaundice levels decrease.

509
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:24,062
I see. You're a doctor,
so do what you think is best.

510
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,689
I'm not a doctor.

511
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,777
Mom, if I haven't practiced
in over 20 years, then I'm not a doctor.

512
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,112
It's like having a driver's license
you never use.

513
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:37,325
Hey, if a baker can't sell any bread,
does that mean he's not a baker?

514
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,161
How is that the same thing?

515
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,665
But your husband is a doctor
at a university hospital.

516
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,042
Why are you staying here?

517
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,712
He went to a conference in Europe today.

518
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,797
Jung-min is an intern.

519
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,424
If I ask him to make time for me,
it'll put him in a tight spot.

520
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,802
If I stay at the hospital,

521
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,846
I won't be able to go home
for a couple of days.

522
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,139
What should I do?

523
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:05,061
They need me there
since it'll be I-rang's midterms soon,

524
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,106
and Jung-min needs to prepare
for his resident exam.

525
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,610
This is bad. There's no one
to prepare food for the kids.

526
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,112
They aren't babies.

527
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,490
Studying is up to them,
and they can feed themselves.

528
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,285
Ever since you were a third grader,
you made your own food and studied alone

529
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,746
and still managed to get good grades.

530
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,457
Gosh, Mom. That was ages ago.

531
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,918
The times are different, Mom.

532
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,132
By the way,

533
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,260
where did you get
that medicine you gave me?

534
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,928
From the medicine shop at the market--

535
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,471
Why?

536
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,223
Was that the issue?

537
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,225
Yes, it seems like it.

538
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,644
Sometimes if you eat something
that doesn't sit well with you,

539
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,020
it can result in acute hepatitis.

540
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,524
These terrible hacks.

541
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,277
How dare they mess around
with something like that?

542
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,320
I should've taken you
to a proper Korean medical clinic

543
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,072
to have the medicine made for you.

544
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,783
I just trusted that medicine shop
because I heard they were good.

545
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,327
I must've lost my mind.

546
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,663
Don't blame yourself.

547
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,707
I'll be back on my feet in a few days.

548
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,043
Don't go there
and take out your anger on them.

549
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,631
-You're really going to get better, right?
-Gosh, of course.

550
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,175
It's not a big deal.

551
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:27,894
It's okay, Ms. Oh.

552
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,653
1 DAY LATER

553
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,405
SEOMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

554
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:43,034
30 DAYS LATER

555
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,457
Hello.

556
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,209
-Please sit over here.
-Sit here.

557
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,126
Okay.

558
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:01,510
The donor compatibility results
for a liver transplant came out.

559
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:06,057
Your son's blood type doesn't match,
your daughter is still a minor,

560
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,434
and your mother
and mother-in-law are elderly.

561
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,270
But thankfully, the results
of your husband's test look good.

562
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,857
He has taken great care of his body,
so he doesn't have a fatty liver.

563
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,985
Goodness. Thank you, Doctor.

564
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,530
The most important thing
is your husband's consent as the donor.

565
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,992
Are you saying my son
has to give his liver to her?

566
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,038
I'm not saying that he must.
I'm just saying that it is possible.

567
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,164
That can't happen.

568
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,833
Cutting open a perfectly healthy person
to give away part of his liver?

569
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,253
He can't take the risk
of going under the knife.

570
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,505
Please don't recommend
that surgery to my son.

571
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,548
-I'll never allow it.
-Mother.

572
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,759
Please stop.

573
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,094
Stop what?

574
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,056
Even if you say yes, I'm against it.

575
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,683
Get out of the way.

576
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:56,274
Jeong-suk, it's not like
you're on the brink of death,

577
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,485
so let's just wait
for a brain-dead donor, okay?

578
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,863
Gosh, my head. I'm so dizzy.

579
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,699
-Grandma.
-Mother!

580
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,576
-Mother, are you all right?
-Why do I feel like this?

581
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,745
Come this way.

582
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,123
-Why do I feel like this?
-Here, sit here.

583
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,000
-Careful.
-What's wrong with me?

584
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,044
-Look at me, Mother.
-I think I'm going to throw up.

585
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,046
Can you see me? Are you going to throw up?

586
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,550
Are you okay?
How sick do you feel, Mother?

587
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,592
No, wait.

588
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,386
-Hold on.
-My gosh.

589
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,888
You don't have a fever.
Mother, look at me.

590
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,066
Ms. Kwak. Are you awake?

591
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,318
Please open your eyes.

592
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,613
Just keep your eyes closed then.

593
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,782
Of course, I understand
how a mother would feel

594
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,952
at the thought of their perfectly
healthy child going under the knife.

595
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,331
But no matter how bad you felt,

596
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,625
you shouldn't have said those things
in front of a person that's sick.

597
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,544
If it was In-ho that was sick,

598
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,088
my daughter would've given him
all her organs.

599
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,592
Ms. Oh! Talking in hypotheticals is wrong.

600
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,385
Right now, the healthy person

601
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:10,014
that has to give up their liver is my son,
not that daughter of yours.

602
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,183
The word "if" doesn't fit this situation.

603
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,644
Did you just say "that daughter of yours"?

604
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,230
When things were good,
she was your daughter-in-law,

605
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,107
but now she's "that daughter of yours"?

606
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,276
Don't change the subject like that.

607
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,363
To be honest, aren't you
the person to blame for all this?

608
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,198
It's all because of that cheap medicine!

609
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,160
And while we're on the topic,
Jung-min got into that car accident

610
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,246
while you were watching him
when he was seven.

611
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,250
This whole time, you've been going on
about how Jeong-suk quit her practice.

612
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,795
But don't feel upset
about her giving up her practice.

613
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,338
Frankly speaking,

614
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,424
it's that accident that made her
a full-time housewife.

615
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,260
Gosh, I'm so furious.

616
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,055
My goodness.

617
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,582
You were more injured
than Jung-min was back then.

618
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,710
You still have that herniated disc
in your back from that accident.

619
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,714
How could she talk
about that accident like that?

620
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:32,471
I don't care whether your mother-in-law
thinks like that or not.

621
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,685
Rather than that,
I feel like In-ho is just so cold-hearted.

622
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,606
It always made me uncomfortable
that my son-in-law was so cold and fussy.

623
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,693
But given his upbringing,
I just accepted it.

624
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,363
But when his own mother
talked like that in front of the kids,

625
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,282
he barely did anything to stop her.

626
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,994
His wife is in this condition,
and even if it was just empty words,

627
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,873
he didn't even say
he'd go through with the surgery.

628
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,169
Even if we're family,

629
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,381
going under the knife isn't easy, Mom.

630
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,592
In this day and age,

631
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,886
someone as educated and smart as you

632
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,430
spent your entire youth
taking care of your ailing father-in-law

633
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,515
and putting up with your mother-in-law.

634
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,809
So how could they do this to you?

635
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,894
Mom.

636
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,770
Mom, look at me.

637
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,940
Mom, don't beg.

638
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,651
Then who will?

639
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,489
Who will beg for your life?

640
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,617
Risking her life for her child
is what a mother does.

641
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,368
So begging for your life is nothing.

642
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,334
If you can just live,
I'd get down on my knees and beg.

643
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,756
Mom.

644
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,884
I'm sorry.

645
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,474
I'm sorry, Mom.

646
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,274
What is this mess?
Why on earth are you doing this?

647
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,526
You bunch of hacks.

648
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,487
How could you trick people
by using such lousy ingredients?

649
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,658
My daughter ate this garbage,
and now she might die.

650
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,370
-What are you going to do about that?
-My goodness, these are expensive!

651
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,746
What are you going to do?

652
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,123
Can't you just use your words?

653
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,295
Jong-su,

654
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,715
you're the best candidate for the surgery.

655
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,926
But her husband can do it.

656
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,511
So why are you doing this to me?

657
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,015
I wouldn't be asking you a favor like this
if I wasn't this desperate.

658
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,310
Here. Take this.

659
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,688
This is everything I have.

660
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,565
It's not a small amount.

661
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,819
I'll give all of this to you.
Just please save my daughter.

662
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:55,739
When my mother died young,
I will never forget how you took us in

663
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,409
and raised us as if we were your children.

664
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,954
And the fact I can live as a proper adult
like this is all thanks to you.

665
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,205
But you doing this

666
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,791
feels like you're pressuring me
to pay back the debt.

667
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,792
It's agonizing.

668
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:11,422
Jong-su, you're the only one
I can cling to.

669
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,011
I heard Professor Seo's wife's condition
is pretty serious.

670
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,680
I mean, how did he let it
get to that point?

671
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,890
I heard Professor Seo was a match.

672
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,225
I know, right?

673
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,270
It's going to be hard
if they still can't find a donor.

674
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,733
Professor Seo was in the same class
as you in medical school, right?

675
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,111
-Yes, he was.
-Then do you know his wife too?

676
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,366
I don't. I wasn't close
with Professor Seo back then.

677
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,161
But why is he having his wife

678
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,164
treated at a different hospital
and not this one?

679
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,958
His wife said being at this hospital
would be uncomfortable.

680
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,210
His son is an intern here.

681
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,423
Professor Seo must be
all out of sorts right now.

682
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,638
-That's what I heard.
-It must be so nice for you.

683
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,099
-We should eat something delicious.
-What do you want to eat for lunch?

684
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,184
I'm hungry.

685
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,813
Patient Kim Yeon-suk from Ward 151…

686
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,107
-Doctor.
-What are you doing here?

687
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,611
Just observing people.

688
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,785
When you're at a hospital,
you see all kinds of things.

689
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:29,333
There are more cases than you think
of donors suddenly changing their minds.

690
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,045
It isn't an easy decision
to donate your organ,

691
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,631
even if it's to your family.

692
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,010
I just feel so bad…

693
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,056
putting this pressure on my family.

694
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,518
Even if something happens to me,

695
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,731
I hope they don't live
their lives feeling guilty.

696
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,650
Don't think about that.

697
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,569
Just get better.

698
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,655
When I was an intern,

699
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,785
I saw mothers
who were just in their early thirties

700
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:10,040
develop cancer and die several times.

701
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:14,420
Maybe it's because of that,
but once I reached my forties,

702
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,964
I thought even if I came down
with a terminal illness,

703
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,550
there wouldn't be anything
to be bitter about.

704
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,553
Even though I always worried that

705
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,767
something terrible might happen
to my husband or kids if I was gone,

706
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,396
I would have those kinds
of thoughts from time to time.

707
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,529
Doctor, I'm so jealous of you.

708
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,367
When I was an intern,
I wanted to become a surgeon.

709
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,662
When I was doing my training,

710
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:53,500
the first surgery
I observed was a liver transplant.

711
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,463
I had no idea I'd end up
needing to receive one.

712
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,550
Now that I think about it,

713
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,386
I really miss the operating room.

714
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,347
Then…

715
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,934
would you like to visit one?

716
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,772
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
PEDIATRIC OPERATING ROOM

717
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,526
Doctor.

718
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,738
A photo to commemorate the event.

719
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,866
You should take a selfie in those clothes.

720
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,201
Gosh, no.

721
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,128
Thank you.

722
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,550
Doctor, but isn't this not allowed?

723
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,262
Just for today, you're a colleague
who has come to observe a surgery.

724
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:48,931
A colleague?

725
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,517
Yes, you have
a medical license, don't you?

726
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,310
-I do.
-Then you're a colleague.

727
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,623
It's a 40-year-old man
suffering from Crohn's disease.

728
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,458
He has an intestinal obstruction
and an abscess,

729
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,835
so we will be performing
a bowel resection surgery.

730
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,848
Scalpel.

731
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,447
-Do I have to feel guilty?
-Why?

732
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,659
You went on a trip with me
on the day your wife went to the ER.

733
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,078
It would've happened
even if I had gone to the hospital.

734
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,373
But it's a relief that a donor was found.

735
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,250
Her cousin, right?

736
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,334
Yes.

737
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,170
It's times like this
that I envy your wife.

738
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,050
When I'm sick,
will you be able to stay by my side?

739
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,179
Will I die all alone in my later years?

740
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,932
-I think about these things.
-Choi Seung-hi.

741
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,561
Sometimes I have to nag like this
so I can relieve my stress too.

742
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,314
The three of us have
a maze-like complicated relationship.

743
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,109
There are no answers and there is no end.

744
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,695
I have nothing I can say to you.

745
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,406
I don't know if there will ever
be answers or an end,

746
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,033
but I can promise you this.

747
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,333
I won't leave you to be all alone.

748
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,425
Hello.

749
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,529
Where is Jong-su?

750
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,865
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

751
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,451
What do you mean, sorry?

752
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,962
EMERGENCY BELL

753
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,215
We can't accept this.

754
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:33,387
Ms. Oh, I don't want him
to get the surgery either.

755
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:38,266
Our child is still so young,
and I'm scared.

756
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,355
He couldn't bring himself to tell you,
so I came here to tell you instead.

757
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,899
But the surgery is booked for tomorrow.

758
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,567
I'm so sorry.

759
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:53,949
Cold blue. Room 306, code blue.

760
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,878
-Ma'am, you can't go in right now.
-That's my daughter…

761
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,012
My daughter suddenly slipped into a coma

762
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,056
and went into the intensive care unit.

763
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,933
I can't even see her face for a moment?

764
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,978
She's in a critical state right now,
so you can't visit her.

765
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,321
Jeong-suk…

766
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,254
-Mom.
-Mom.

767
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,966
Mom, are you okay?

768
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,093
Mom.

769
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,532
Dad.

770
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,077
Can't you just donate your liver?

771
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,374
It's not that simple.

772
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,045
This is a much more dangerous surgery
than you think…

773
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,379
As long as it's fine with you,

774
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,049
I also think it'd be great
if you could donate your liver.

775
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,468
There's no other alternative, Father.

776
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,939
Mother, I think I have
to go through with the surgery.

777
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,775
We have to save the children's mother.

778
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,236
Her condition is too critical
to wait for a donor.

779
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,072
Please give me permission, Mother!

780
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,866
If I don't give you permission,
will you not do the surgery?

781
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,080
Get up.

782
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,707
Why are you on your knees?

783
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,460
You did nothing wrong.
Why are you on your knees?

784
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,003
I'm sorry.

785
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,798
This is why I told you
not to get into a marriage like this.

786
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,300
I was against it from the get-go.

787
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,053
How could someone so smart
be so daft at the same time?

788
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,721
To leave that perfect girl, Seung-hi…

789
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,309
I never forgot her name
because it was such a waste.

790
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,938
You kicked your own luck away like that

791
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,898
and got a good-for-nothing girl pregnant.

792
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,359
Gosh, men are unbelievable.

793
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,111
Get out, you bastard.

794
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,988
Get out!

795
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,157
-Get out!
-I'm leaving.

796
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:45,579
I'm so furious. Gosh…

797
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:49,332
Goodness! Filthy little bastards!

798
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,502
SEOMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

799
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,214
In-ho,

800
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,509
thank you for making
such a difficult decision.

801
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,430
I'll never forget this.

802
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,931
No. I…

803
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,102
should've said yes
from the beginning. I'm sorry.

804
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,187
Gosh, don't say that.

805
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,649
It isn't easy to decide
to donate your liver to someone.

806
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,237
Let me go get some water.

807
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:30,790
Honey.

808
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,670
I know you made a difficult decision.

809
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:40,842
This might just be an excuse,
but if I think of Mom and the kids,

810
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:46,139
I want to live a little bit longer.

811
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:53,480
It'd be a lie to say there has
never been a time when I hated you.

812
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:58,109
Every time you made me think

813
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,612
that you'd be okay
whether or not I was here,

814
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,157
I wanted to confirm that wasn't true.

815
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,203
And it made me become
even more engrossed in household work.

816
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:14,834
But still, there was a part of me
that held feelings of hate

817
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,754
and resentment toward you.

818
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,132
But after falling ill like this…

819
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,054
it turns out my husband
is the one who will save my life.

820
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:36,272
I'll never stop being grateful to you
for the rest of my life.

821
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,400
I mean it.

822
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,111
Thank you.

823
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,072
And…

824
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,995
I'm so sorry.

825
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:56,918
I'm sorry.

826
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,549
-Is this really the only option?
-It is.

827
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,010
Will you donate your liver to me too
if I get sick?

828
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,052
I will.

829
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,097
Then give me your liver,
your kidney, and your heart!

830
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,098
Give me everything!

831
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,641
All of it!

832
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,145
Then I'll die.

833
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,026
-Seung-hi.
-What?

834
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,902
I'll call you when the surgery is over.

835
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:31,244
Until then, be brave and well,
just like you always are.

836
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,093
Actually…

837
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,474
I went to Gusan University
School of Medicine in 1995.

838
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,977
May I ask which university you went to?

839
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,982
I was raised in the US.
I did my undergrad at Stanford

840
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,401
and then went to Harvard Medical School.

841
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,947
Well, I've heard all the rumors
about what a talented doctor you are,

842
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,032
but as a fellow surgeon,

843
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:12,660
I need to be able to continue to perform
long surgeries, don't you think?

844
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,874
If there are any aftereffects
I should be aware of,

845
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,751
please tell me everything honestly.

846
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,463
Not to your wife, but to you?

847
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,381
Yes.

848
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,763
You'll have a scar.

849
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,224
A scar?

850
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,600
Yes.

851
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,104
You could suffer from jaundice
or a high fever,

852
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,605
but if you take good care of yourself,

853
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,023
there's nothing to worry about.

854
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,192
I'm not sitting here
to hear obvious answers.

855
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,152
Could you let me know
how many liver transplants

856
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,821
you've performed and their success rate?

857
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,201
-Mr. Seo.
-Yes?

858
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,494
You're a surgeon,

859
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,413
so I'm sure you know
the surgery process and the aftereffects.

860
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,667
But if you find yourself
hesitating about the surgery,

861
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,877
you can give it more thought
before deciding.

862
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,547
That's not what I meant.

863
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,890
SURGERY, ANESTHESIA,
BLOOD TRANSFUSION CONSENT FORM

864
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,943
CONSENTING PARTY'S SIGNATURE OR SEAL

865
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,130
I'm getting a call.

866
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,383
INCOMING CALL
CHOI SEUNG-HI

867
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,553
In-ho.

868
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,557
In-ho, don't do it!

869
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,934
You absolutely can't!

870
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,682
It's okay.

871
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,562
OPERATING ROOM 1

872
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,899
PATIENT NAME: CHA JEONG-SUK
SURGEON: ROY KIM

873
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,336
We will now begin
Cha Jeong-suk's liver transplant.

874
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,255
Scalpel.

875
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,589
In-ho, don't do it!

876
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,840
Don't sign it!

877
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,801
No! You absolutely can't!

878
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,430
No, I won't let you!

879
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,943
Mom, are you okay?

880
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,821
Mom.

881
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,540
-Honey.
-Yes?

882
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,211
Yes, tell me. What is it?

883
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,048
What?

884
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,218
What did you say?

885
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,308
You…

886
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,101
little…

887
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,188
bastard.

888
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,792
Excuse me, the patient here has woken up!

889
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,020
DOCTOR CHA

890
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,962
After coming back from the brink of death,
it turns out all of that was meaningless.

891
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,296
Has she lost her mind?

892
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,507
You said I didn't have to worry
about the household chores anymore.

893
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,384
-Is my juice not ready yet?
-You can make it yourself.

894
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,594
Maybe it's because I escaped death.

895
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,180
I wanted to start doing things
I hadn't done before.

896
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,768
Did the big surgery
mess with her head or something?

897
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,770
Why are you suddenly acting weird?

898
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,939
I spent the last 20 years
not doing stuff like this.

899
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,985
I'm going to live
however I please from now on.

900
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:23,948
