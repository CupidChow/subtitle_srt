00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,972
-Dr. Cha, congratulations!
-Congratulations!

3
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,269
-Dr. Cha.
-Yes?

4
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,105
-What were you going to talk to me about?
-Sorry?

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,441
Didn't you come to my office
to tell me something?

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,901
That…

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,279
It was nothing.

8
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,198
Really? I see.

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,785
-What is your deal?
-What do you mean?

10
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,453
-What?
-Why did you push me?

11
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,996
You pushed yourself, not me.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,456
-Are you joking?
-Joking?

13
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,791
I don't have to joke with you.

14
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,793
What's with the tie?
Do you work at a bar or something?

15
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,002
I need to talk to you.

16
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:26,920
Just go away.

17
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,254
"Waiter, I'll have some snacks…"

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,924
Did you tell your department?

19
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,928
I can inform my department
if you're uncomfortable doing it yourself.

20
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,515
I need more time to think about this.

21
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,895
Haven't you had enough time to think?

22
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,146
What's there to think about now?

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,857
Why are you so keen on kicking me out?

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,902
What do you mean?
You're the one who decided to quit.

25
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,697
And this is all for the sake of you
and our family.

26
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,326
Right. What a great excuse.

27
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,749
Yes, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

28
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,168
Yes.

29
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,628
Okay, I'm coming right now!

30
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,847
CHOI SEUNG-HI

31
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,603
Hello?

32
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,606
You told me she was going
to quit working at the hospital!

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,567
Let's meet and talk. See you later.

34
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,539
Ma'am, stay with us.

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,124
Check her blood sugar level.

36
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,877
-It's at 120.
-Please administer one dose of lorazepam.

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,503
Administering one dose of lorazepam.

38
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,381
She was granted a stay of execution
but with her condition…

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:54,966
Does that mean

40
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,218
she can go home?

41
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,261
It does.

42
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,138
But she has no family and no home.

43
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,557
There are a lot of people like her.

44
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,276
Ma'am.

45
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:20,825
What can I do to convince you
to get yourself treated?

46
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,125
I don't deserve
to be treated like a mother.

47
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,728
What would my daughter look like?

48
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:05,286
My daughter did well in school,
so she was planning to go to med school.

49
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,415
But I have no idea
where she is or how she's living.

50
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,629
I don't know if she got to study medicine
given how expensive it is.

51
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,548
She had no one to help her.

52
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,352
What made you so certain?

53
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,396
You shouldn't have given me hope.

54
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,440
She said herself that she would quit.

55
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,276
-I didn't know--
-What will you do now?

56
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,111
I can't work with your wife.

57
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,113
Give me time to think--

58
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,490
When will you ever reach a conclusion?

59
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,075
Darn it.

60
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:47,996
Get out.

61
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,665
-What?
-I said get out.

62
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,667
I can't bear being in the same car as you.

63
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,837
What about dinner?
I thought you wanted cold noodles.

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,755
Enjoy the stupid noodles by yourself.

65
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,856
Where am I?

66
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,150
I left my bag.

67
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,779
I think I might've gone mad.

68
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,240
I slightly envy you these days.

69
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,287
It feels like
there's no progress in life for me,

70
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,540
but it feels as
if time runs backward for you.

71
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,083
Come on.

72
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,253
Hey, anyway,

73
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,589
you know people
in the medical association, right?

74
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,798
Yes, I do.

75
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,135
I told you one of my patients is a felon
who got a life sentence, right?

76
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,138
I want to find her daughter.
Could you lend me a hand?

77
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,016
She has a unique name. Han Yeong-long.

78
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,517
Jeong-suk.

79
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,980
-Do I look like a private investigator?
-You little…

80
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,859
You have lots of connections.
Help me out here.

81
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:03,946
Hello.

82
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,341
Who is that?

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,595
He's a professor
in the department I'm dispatched to.

84
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,682
What's funny is he's the one
who performed my liver transplant.

85
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,393
He came to this hospital recently.

86
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,562
Is he married?

87
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,897
No.

88
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,233
-What's his personality like?
-He's nice.

89
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,821
Why didn't you tell someone that handsome
was working at this hospital?

90
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,574
Is that…

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,285
something I should be sharing with you?

92
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,080
Whatever. Can you set us up
so we can meet naturally?

93
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,916
Hey! We're not some teenagers.

94
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,419
Didn't you say you need my help
in finding that felon's daughter?

95
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,923
I guess you aren't
that desperate about it.

96
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,228
Didn't you get a physical checkup
done last year?

97
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,729
A quite expensive one, at that.

98
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,941
Just because I had beef last year

99
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,026
doesn't mean I can't
have it again this year.

100
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,529
Yes, you're right.

101
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:27,989
By the way,

102
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,660
since the kids are here, let's be careful
how we address each other.

103
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,661
Sure.

104
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,204
As you wish, Ms. Ae-sim.

105
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,374
-Ms. Ae-sim?
-"Hey, Ae-sim."

106
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,335
I can't address you like that, can I?

107
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,927
The botox you got last time settled
a bit unnaturally on your face.

108
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,429
Your eyebrows don't match.

109
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,764
-Ms. Kwak Ae-sim.
-Yes.

110
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,351
Ms. Oh Deok-rye.

111
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,394
Yes.

112
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,625
Goodness.

113
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,964
Honey.

114
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,510
Honey.

115
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,061
This is so delicious.

116
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:45,399
How did you find such a great restaurant?

117
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:51,030
It's been so long
since I've met someone on my level.

118
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,366
Oh, my. This is crazy.

119
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,377
She really must be dating.

120
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,714
It's been a long time.

121
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,840
Have you…

122
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,884
been well?

123
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,305
You shamelessly turned your back
on your family for 20 years,

124
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,266
and you ask if I've been well?

125
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,850
You must be her.

126
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,394
It's nice to meet you.

127
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,062
What's your name?

128
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,397
What's the point in asking that?

129
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,816
This family hasn't changed one bit.

130
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,235
It's still old-fashioned and ignorant.

131
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,361
You're one to talk.

132
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,614
You must be so sophisticated
that you had an illegitimate child

133
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,117
and came to Dad's funeral
for your share of the inheritance.

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,118
Listen.

135
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,329
Back then, I was too young and naive,

136
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,583
so I thought I was a sinner
for having a child outside of marriage.

137
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,751
That's why I kept a low profile.

138
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,380
I can understand Dad's anger toward me

139
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,550
because he expected much from me
as you were so pathetic.

140
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,385
But…

141
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,556
it's plain rude of you
to treat me like this.

142
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,102
He's the one who stopped your father
from disowning you.

143
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,146
If you had been disowned,

144
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,566
you wouldn't have any money to your name,
let alone an inheritance.

145
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,568
People would laugh

146
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,820
to hear you say
I have no money to my name.

147
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,615
Stop showing off
when you're only a working doctor.

148
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,158
Just get lost.

149
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,493
Well, this working doctor is
about to become rich.

150
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,164
Talk to my lawyer
regarding the inheritance.

151
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,291
Don't even think of
leaving out a single coin.

152
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,835
You know I'm much smarter than you, right?

153
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,295
Let's go.

154
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,963
-You little--
-Excuse me!

155
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,382
My name

156
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,052
is Choi Eun-seo.

157
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,971
I'm not some illegitimate child.
I'm Choi Seung-hi's daughter,

158
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,473
Choi Eun-seo.

159
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
Mom, are you sad?

160
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,071
Yes.

161
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,906
What are you sad about?

162
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,745
About Grandpa dying,
or Uncle being that rude to you?

163
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,165
Both.

164
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,751
Then you should cry.

165
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,005
I should.

166
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,862
Her daughter really did become a doctor.

167
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,198
She runs her own clinic in Gangnam.

168
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:43,327
She married into an affluent family
and has two kids.

169
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,413
SOOTHING INTERNAL MEDICINE CLINIC

170
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,956
What are your symptoms?

171
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,918
I didn't actually come here
because I'm sick.

172
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,586
Well…

173
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:58,342
I came to speak to you about your mother.

174
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,139
Your mother is currently a patient
at Gusan University Hospital.

175
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,058
And I'm her doctor.

176
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,895
Your mother misses you a lot.

177
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,731
I may be out of line here,

178
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:17,653
but I wanted to help her,
so I asked around about you.

179
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,325
I had forgotten about my mother.

180
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,998
To be frank, all of this is making me
extremely uncomfortable.

181
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,333
Your mother was

182
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,087
granted a stay of execution.

183
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,215
She doesn't have
to live in prison anymore.

184
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,759
But she has nowhere to go.

185
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,431
I heard there are organizations
for people like her.

186
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,017
Please don't put that pressure on me.

187
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,269
We're worse off than strangers.

188
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,564
Would it be too difficult to understand

189
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
your mother?

190
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,859
Who?

191
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,736
Me?

192
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,581
Mom.

193
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,750
Hey, welcome home.

194
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,627
Mom, what is that?

195
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,421
It's medicine for your dad.

196
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,673
You must be hungry. Do you want to eat?

197
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,884
-Yes.
-Give me a second.

198
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,173
You're not eating?

199
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,508
I will.

200
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,681
I was…

201
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,559
the one who poisoned his food. Not her.

202
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,770
I wanted to be free of that hellish life.

203
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,690
I'm the one who poisoned him.

204
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,358
So…

205
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,110
who's supposed to understand whom?

206
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,988
The child she gave birth to

207
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,699
made her go to jail.

208
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,577
Your mother…

209
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,663
will understand.

210
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,752
You must know since you're a mother too.

211
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,182
Overall, you've taken good care
of your health.

212
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,436
No need to take any pills
for diabetes or blood pressure.

213
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,897
Your bone density is high
considering your age.

214
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,481
That's a relief.

215
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,067
And the mole you were worried
about on your back.

216
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,611
We did a biopsy on it.

217
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,238
It's benign. So you don't have to worry.

218
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,952
Then you're saying it's okay, right?
It's not something like cancer?

219
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,746
It's not.

220
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,666
I guess I worried for nothing.
It's such a relief I came to check.

221
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,169
I should have listened
to my daughter earlier.

222
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,424
My daughter said I should get a checkup.

223
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,676
Your daughter was very wise.

224
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,094
Yes.

225
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,262
Cancer?

226
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,389
It's cancer,

227
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,682
but it's thyroid cancer.

228
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,394
The treatment is simple and easy
compared to other cancers.

229
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,064
Cancer is cancer.
What kind of cancer is simple?

230
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,817
You always talk about things
related to me as if they're nothing.

231
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,819
Jeong-suk is right.

232
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,239
Don't worry. The surgery is simple
and the prognosis is good.

233
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,450
Your father died of cancer.

234
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:56,121
The word cancer itself is so frightening
that it wakes me up at night.

235
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:01,043
Goodness, how could life be so cruel?

236
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,463
I-rang, get me water.

237
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,715
Hey, get it yourself.

238
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,300
Seriously.

239
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,135
How lazy can you be?

240
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,348
Jung-min, when did you get home?

241
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,933
Hello.

242
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,645
-I-rang, you're back from your academy?
-Yes.

243
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,399
Did you kids hear the news?

244
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,030
I have cancer.

245
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,369
Grandma, the surgery isn't a big deal.

246
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,705
You'll be admitted for three or four days

247
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,873
and make sure to take hormone medication
after the surgery.

248
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,797
Here.

249
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,924
You have to eat well.

250
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,885
You need strength to get surgery.

251
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,060
You're the only one
who cares about me, Professor Park.

252
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,145
Of course.

253
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,898
When we were young, were we able
to consider our parents' feelings?

254
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,150
You're right.

255
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,527
What you're saying is right.

256
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,696
That's why I'm investing again.

257
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,951
At our age, we need money in our hands
to be treated like adults.

258
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,746
Professor, what are you investing in?

259
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,332
A friend of mine opened up
a big convalescent hospital.

260
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,585
I pleaded and barely just got in
on the action.

261
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,297
How much did you invest?

262
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,178
Currently, you can be approved for a loan
of up to 1.18 billion won.

263
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,890
But the building is
under Cha Jeong-suk's name.

264
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,976
Yes. That's my daughter-in-law
and because of taxes--

265
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,021
I'm the one who manages everything.

266
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,314
I'm sorry, ma'am.

267
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,985
Even if you're family,
the owner has to be here for the loan.

268
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,988
I'm telling you I'm the actual owner.

269
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,865
It was initially mine.

270
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,660
Please visit with your daughter-in-law
to take out your loan.

271
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,209
GUKIL BANK

272
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,462
Did you think I didn't know that?

273
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,924
I never told her
the house is under her name.

274
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,847
We will now begin the resident
disciplinary committee meeting.

275
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,392
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk, Ms. Jang Hae-nam
is your patient, right?

276
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,396
-Yes.
-You knew she was a prisoner under custody

277
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,359
so why did you escort her to her tests
without a corrections officer present?

278
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,070
The corrections officer
at the time was ill

279
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,823
and asked me to escort the patient
to get her tests done.

280
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,908
And I said yes.

281
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,746
Apparently, you also requested
the patient's handcuffs to be loosened.

282
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,416
The patient's wrists were badly wounded,

283
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,502
so I requested it.

284
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,965
Then shouldn't you have been
more cautious with the patient?

285
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,219
I was in the middle
of escorting the patient

286
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,099
when Professor Choi Seung-hi asked me
to go on an urgent errand.

287
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,228
So I was going to ask an intern
to take over,

288
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,480
but the patient disappeared.

289
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,900
Are you blaming this on Professor Choi?

290
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,819
No.

291
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,490
It is my fault. I did not suspect
the patient would leave the hospital.

292
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,953
Dr. Cha, you may leave.

293
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,872
Yes, sir.

294
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,458
Goodness.

295
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,753
Director, what will you do?

296
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,673
We'll reduce her wages for three months.

297
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,134
Director.

298
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,386
A murderer escaped the hospital
without authorization.

299
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,014
I don't think this is
something to be taken lightly.

300
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,100
But the patient returned without an issue.

301
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,811
Thanks to Dr. Cha,

302
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,980
we received two robotic surgical systems.

303
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,148
It's not a small feat.

304
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,236
Our department benefited the most,
so can't we be a little generous?

305
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,780
Professor Seo?

306
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,535
A three-month wage reduction will do.

307
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,956
If we fire or suspend Dr. Cha
and Chairman Oh finds out,

308
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,166
we'll lose 10 billion won.

309
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,044
A wise decision, sir.

310
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,013
Dr. Han.

311
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,062
I'm glad you're here.

312
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,258
Mom.

313
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,634
Your daughter was being treated

314
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,053
at the OB-GYN for constipation
and abdominal pain.

315
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,516
But after she was moved to our department,
we discovered a mass.

316
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:55,689
We have to perform a C-section
before operating on the cancer.

317
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,526
But your daughter insists on waiting
until the baby weighs two kilograms

318
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,487
before removing the cancer.

319
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,989
Who is the baby's father?

320
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,783
Well…

321
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,661
I'm not exactly sure.

322
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,538
Why are you asking the doctor that?

323
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,206
If she's giving birth
to a fatherless child,

324
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,001
she can stay unmarried
and raise the baby on her own!

325
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,005
Why would you curse a girl
with a promising future ahead of her?

326
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,966
Why don't you live alone
if you like that idea so much?

327
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,176
Let go!

328
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,886
Please stop.

329
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,102
It's about after the surgery.

330
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,645
Yes, go ahead.

331
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:40,108
Can't you just tell our daughter
that the baby died?

332
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,820
We'll put the baby up for adoption
through a trusted agency.

333
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,241
I can't just let my 20-year-old daughter
become a mother like this.

334
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,952
That's out of the question.

335
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,039
We don't have that right either.

336
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,249
You should…

337
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,710
try persuading your daughter.

338
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,387
We have to catch that worthless father

339
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,264
and beat him to a pulp.

340
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,894
We need to restrict the employment
of assholes who abandon their kids.

341
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,064
They should have electronic ankle monitors

342
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,775
or be chemically castrated like criminals.

343
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,737
Single parents get pointed at and blamed
because of scumbags like them.

344
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,906
The innocent kids get adopted abroad
and live like strangers

345
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,075
before coming back
looking for their birth parents.

346
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,077
-Aren't I right?
-Sure.

347
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,537
Hey, pour me some soda.

348
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,959
This country should stop telling people
to have more kids

349
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,586
and focus on supporting the kids
who get adopted abroad instead.

350
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,755
The government always does nothing.

351
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,136
Didn't you say you were going
to a buffet later?

352
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,221
Because it's your grandmother's birthday?

353
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,430
A buffet is a buffet.

354
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,349
Fried chicken is fried chicken.

355
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,060
-Right?
-Totally.

356
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,822
Are you just coming back?

357
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,365
Yes.

358
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,702
My parents threw a fit earlier, right?

359
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,370
It makes sense.

360
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,623
Even I'm worried about you.
It's natural for them to worry

361
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,667
Do you agree with my parents

362
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,837
and think my baby should be
given up for adoption?

363
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,924
Not really.

364
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,137
But what I know is that
an entirely different life will unfold.

365
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,891
I know that too.

366
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,475
Do you think I haven't considered that?

367
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,563
I'll go now. This isn't good for the baby.

368
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,780
Don't give out ridiculous advice.

369
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,578
Just because you're an adult doesn't mean
you have the right to give out advice.

370
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:02,417
Raising a child on your own isn't easy.

371
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,587
How would you know that

372
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,631
when you raised your kids in comfort?

373
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:13,470
I just shared my concern
because I'm a parent too.

374
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,598
You should know too
since you have a daughter.

375
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,351
Were you snooping on me?

376
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,727
"Snooping"?

377
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,314
I just happened to hear you
on the phone with your daughter.

378
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,057
I guess she could have the same one.

379
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,352
It's a bracelet you can buy
from the department store after all.

380
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,077
I'm sorry I yelled at you that night.

381
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,329
I know it's not your fault.

382
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,584
I don't think I have the right
to receive an apology from you.

383
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,878
About your wife.

384
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,799
What will you do if she says
she's going to finish her residency?

385
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,262
Just give me a little time.

386
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,897
Did you say goodbye to your father?

387
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,900
Yes, I went to the funeral.

388
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,904
There's a single mom among your patients.

389
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,073
Right, what about her?

390
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,577
That girl's parents want
to put the baby up for adoption.

391
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,371
My dad said the same thing.

392
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,001
He continued to think Eun-seo
ruined my life until the day he died.

393
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,881
That's why I think you're so amazing.

394
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,636
Thank you for not giving up on Eun-seo.

395
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,680
Do you mean it?

396
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,976
What do you mean?

397
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,146
I remember how your face went pale

398
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,732
when I told you
I was pregnant with Eun-seo.

399
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,902
Even now, you try so hard
to look happy when you see her.

400
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,491
Throughout my entire life,
I always turned pale

401
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,328
when someone told me
that they were having my child.

402
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,081
I assure you it wasn't just with Eun-seo.

403
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,506
Can you go home late today?

404
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,259
How late?

405
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,555
Not showering?

406
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,432
Well,

407
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,685
I just wanted to comfortably rest.

408
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,524
We came all the way here.
You just want to rest?

409
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,195
Yes.

410
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,535
Sure, that's understandable.

411
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,123
There was excitement between us
since we weren't married.

412
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,626
If we were,
we'd be using separate rooms already.

413
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,628
It's not that.

414
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,924
Then what is it?
Do you have another woman?

415
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,468
The truth is…

416
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,681
-I'm taking medication.
-Medication?

417
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,767
-What kind of medication?
-Finasteride.

418
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,563
I've been balding on the top of my head.

419
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,732
You know the side effects.

420
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,818
It's not reacting at all.

421
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,828
You just started taking it, right?

422
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,872
You're just getting used to it.

423
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,207
After a month,
it'll start doing its job again.

424
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,542
You can't be sure.

425
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,794
It's not like I can quit
medication for hair loss.

426
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,883
I haven't seen you
being this cute in a while.

427
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,509
Were you so worried about that?

428
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,845
You should have told me
from the beginning.

429
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,973
Then for today…

430
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,560
let's hold hands,

431
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,105
chat, and order something delicious.

432
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,649
Forget it.

433
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,859
We're not some gal pals.

434
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,320
We can be gal pals for today.

435
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,822
This is nice.

436
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,074
Then is this how I become a woman?

437
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,826
No, you'll become a man again.

438
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,998
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

439
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,082
I'm sorry I'm late.

440
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,667
Why are you so late?

441
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,253
-How have you been?
-Grandma, happy birthday.

442
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,088
Let's go eat, come on.

443
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,299
-Have you been well?
-Yes, Auntie. How about you?

444
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,934
What is it? Do you know them?

445
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,018
Sorry?

446
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,604
No, not really.

447
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,272
Let's go.

448
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:49,681
This country's traffic order is a mess
because of the likes of you!

449
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,559
You're the one who swerved in
without using your turn signals!

450
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,186
Look at you,
not even bothering to apologize.

451
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,689
How dare you stare
and talk to me like that?

452
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,190
How old are you?

453
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,942
Look at the direction of the car!

454
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,236
What about the direction? Let's hear it.

455
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,823
-This is a new car!
-Sir, you can talk to me.

456
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,575
Go inside.

457
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,535
Goodness.

458
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,745
You should've helped her sooner.

459
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,651
Hey, it's been a while.

460
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,821
Yes, it has been.

461
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,948
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

462
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,328
I actually have a favor to ask you.

463
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,787
To me?

464
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,123
You'll be dispatched to
family medicine next, right?

465
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,292
Yes, that's right.

466
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,919
Can't you switch with me?

467
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,795
I'll be in pediatrics.

468
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,923
Can we please switch?

469
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,216
Please?

470
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,680
Oh, my. You have the same one as me.

471
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,434
I guess this must be popular these days.

472
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,061
I keep seeing it around.

473
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,563
I got this as a birthday gift
from my boyfriend.

474
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,858
Me too. I got this as a birthday present
from my husband too.

475
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,113
I thought you said
your husband passed away.

476
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,911
Well…

477
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,412
A long time ago.

478
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,414
I got this

479
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,333
before he died.

480
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,045
Anyway, I can switch.

481
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,214
So it's pediatrics?

482
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,591
Yes, thank you so much, Jeong-suk.

483
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,301
Your order is ready.

484
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,303
Thank you.

485
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,306
This is for you.

486
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,767
Thank you, I'll get going.

487
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,238
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

488
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,369
-Was that your last surgery for the day?
-No, I have another one left.

489
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,067
I normally try not to interfere
in other people's business.

490
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,738
But thinking about it, I realized
it's not exactly unrelated to me

491
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,993
since Dr. Cha
is both my patient and colleague.

492
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,084
How about you stop deceiving your wife?

493
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,171
You and Professor Choi Seung-hi.

494
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,885
It greatly irks me
to try and turn a blind eye

495
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:15,803
to what is happening.

496
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,986
I don't know what you're talking about.

497
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,072
And let me warn you.

498
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,492
Mind your own business

499
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,243
unless you want to get
needlessly misconstrued.

500
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,995
How dare he?

501
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,251
The patient is experiencing
a lot of diarrhea,

502
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,628
so I tested for PMC,
and it came out positive.

503
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,839
The patient is on oral vancomycin

504
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,967
but since the diarrhea didn't stop,
I prescribed an antidiarrheal.

505
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,385
Which antidiarrheal?

506
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,553
Loperamide.

507
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,932
Are you out of your mind?

508
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,269
Don't you know what happens
if a PMC patient takes that?

509
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,358
If you administer loperamide,
which reduces bowel movements,

510
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,527
there will be a bacterial overgrowth
and the PMC worsens.

511
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,444
You should know this.

512
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,244
From now on, don't join in on rounds
and don't come into the operating room.

513
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,538
No, don't bother coming in at all.

514
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,832
Why not start with actually
bothering to study first?

515
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,084
Preferably somewhere out of the way.

516
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,815
Get out.

517
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,817
Stop hanging around against my orders.

518
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,713
What brings you here?

519
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,050
I'm in charge of this patient.

520
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,385
Professor Seo told me to take over.

521
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,472
I'll finish up. Please move.

522
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,642
I'm already busy as is.

523
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:16,901
What are you doing?

524
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,987
Are you screwing me over
because I'm not quitting?

525
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,490
Stop reading into it. It's not that.

526
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,285
Then why are you treating me
like I'm invisible?

527
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:30,915
I'm following my belief not to give work
to someone incompetent.

528
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,583
It is rational and fair.

529
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,711
I thought you wanted to be treated
like any other resident?

530
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,258
This is your ridiculous way of telling me

531
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,842
to quit working.

532
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,596
-What?
-Is it an illness of yours or just a habit

533
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,598
to play dirty against someone powerless

534
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,600
and still act like you're high and mighty?

535
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,769
You're all about rationality and reason.

536
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,690
So did you think I'd quit
if you made a fool out of me?

537
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,983
Like I did 20 years ago?

538
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,442
Yes!

539
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,027
So please just quit!

540
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,239
Do you know how hard it is
to see you at work?

541
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:11,497
You say whatever you want,
but have you ever considered how I feel?

542
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,915
No.

543
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,335
I didn't think
about how you felt on purpose.

544
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,212
I want to put myself first from now on.

545
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,049
I finally realized
there's a life for me out there,

546
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,509
so I can't stop again now!

547
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,720
Honey, this is my last chance.

548
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,558
Please…

549
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,144
let me continue down this path.

550
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,481
I won't even ask for you
to help pave the road or hold my hand.

551
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,399
Just…

552
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,695
let me be able to walk down this path.

553
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,422
You don't have to come.

554
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,280
Professor.

555
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,617
What are you doing here?

556
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,703
I know, right?

557
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,998
What am I doing here?

558
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:42,046
Do you remember
when you told me to quit last time?

559
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,382
You said that on purpose, right?

560
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,884
Of course.

561
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,013
Because I knew that you wouldn't quit.

562
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,557
It seems like I held out in vain.

563
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,936
Dr. Cha.

564
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,355
How about we become friends?

565
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,649
Not rapport, but actual friends.

566
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,364
Friends?

567
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,408
That's a little too much.

568
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,620
I mean, aren't I older than you?

569
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,455
Come on.

570
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,958
Just be friends with me.

571
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,587
Do you want to exercise with me?
Let's run a marathon.

572
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,214
A marathon?

573
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,757
Yes.

574
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,008
Ever since I was young,

575
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:32,513
I could leave every worry behind
once I started running.

576
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,681
That's why I like it.

577
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,932
Right.

578
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,853
When I was young,
there was this cartoon called Run Hany.

579
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,023
The main character, Hany,
would run and console herself

580
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,986
because she missed
her late mother so much.

581
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,029
Then I naturally knew

582
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,407
that running is a good exercise

583
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,077
that helps you forget
about all the bad things in your head.

584
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,328
That's great then.

585
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,248
I have a crew that runs on the weekends.

586
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,499
You should join us.

587
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,006
Dr. Kim, can I bring a friend along?

588
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,345
We're going to start at Jamsu Bridge
and follow north of Hangang Bridge.

589
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,600
Then we'll hit Nodeul Island
and come back to Jamsu Bridge.

590
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,976
It's about 9km?

591
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:24,148
But since we're beginners,
I don't think we can run for 9km.

592
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,776
Professor, can't you run along
slowly with us?

593
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,821
All right. Shall we begin now?

594
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,324
How about we start by walking briskly?

595
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,410
We'll warm ourselves up
for the first two kilometers,

596
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,870
then we'll begin running.

597
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,997
Okay, let's go!

598
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:44,960
Hey.

599
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,838
Didn't you finish a full marathon?

600
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,756
Me?

601
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,174
That's news to me.

602
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,387
Goodness, that sneaky little fox.

603
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,557
Lift it.

604
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,726
A little more.

605
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,770
It's not this side.

606
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,313
No, the opposite.

607
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,233
This side--

608
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,695
Professor, are you okay?

609
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,658
Yes, I'm okay.

610
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,953
Yes, hold it like that.

611
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,412
Okay.

612
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,935
It's adhesive capsulitis.

613
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,186
Simply put, a frozen shoulder.

614
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,231
A frozen shoulder?

615
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,608
It's not a ligament rupture?

616
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,609
No.

617
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,944
It won't heal fast.

618
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,280
If you get physical therapy
and stretch regularly,

619
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,907
then it'll help with the pain
and recover your mobility.

620
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,118
Does it hurt a lot? Do you want a shot?

621
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,370
I'm too young to have a frozen shoulder.

622
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,998
What do you mean? You're almost 50.

623
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,749
What are you--

624
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,296
Hey, are you balding?

625
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,215
The top of your head is looking sparse.

626
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,386
Right.

627
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,055
I'm taking medication for hair loss.

628
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,977
Thanks to it, I can't even get it up!

629
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,359
The implant I got two years ago
is coming back up.

630
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,030
I have dysfunctions everywhere! Happy?

631
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,115
I don't even know who I am or where I am.

632
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,534
I can't feel my legs.

633
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,454
-He's coming.
-You did well.

634
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,540
-You did really well for your first time.
-Thank you.

635
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,587
To thank you for allowing us to join in,

636
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,839
how about we have dinner together?

637
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,466
It'll be my treat.

638
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,260
I'm so tired.

639
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,310
Right, I know
some good places around here.

640
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,729
Sorry, I already have plans today.

641
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,565
-I'll join next time.
-Okay.

642
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,775
Bye.

643
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,984
Bye.

644
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,987
I think maybe that guy

645
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,031
is interested in you.

646
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,160
What kind of nonsense is that?

647
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,120
Look how naive you are.

648
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,875
Asking to work out together
is clearly a move to start something up.

649
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,627
Stop saying ridiculous things.

650
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,504
It's not good to have excessive delusions.

651
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,588
Then is this

652
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,924
a type of friendship Americans have?

653
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,592
Who cares?

654
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,638
Don't these kinds of misunderstandings
and delusions make life fun?

655
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,727
Baek Mi-hee, you must still be young
to be able to think like that.

656
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,979
I'm going.

657
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,566
-Should we do another lap?
-Forget it.

658
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,692
Let's run one more lap.

659
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,363
MY LOVE TO YOU

660
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,783
Hello.

661
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,589
You should be careful.

662
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,718
-I really like this TV show too.
-Sorry.

663
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,803
I see.

664
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,431
They say the leads
are really dating each other.

665
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,724
No wonder they have great chemistry.

666
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,893
I'll have to take responsibility.

667
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,407
Excuse me.

668
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,284
Are you not going to pay?

669
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,622
Dr. Cha.

670
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,635
Should we have dinner tonight?
We weren't able to last time.

671
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,595
Then…

672
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,472
should I also invite my friend?

673
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,765
No.

674
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,476
Just the two of us.

675
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,354
Just the two of us?

676
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,814
Yes.

677
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,359
Don't you want to?

678
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,742
What was that?

679
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,660
What is wrong with me?

680
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,748
Why did I have that kind of dream?
I must be crazy.

681
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,208
This is so embarrassing.

682
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,918
I must be out of my mind.

683
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,128
Why is my heart racing like this?

684
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,755
Goodness.

685
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,008
I really am crazy!

686
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,093
I can't believe this!

687
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,137
He's a leukemia patient?

688
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,807
Yes. His lower abdomen hurt for a week,
and he was admitted to the ER

689
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,184
after he felt stabbing pains.

690
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,063
Judging by the MRI and CT scans,
there are signs of colorectal cancer.

691
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,774
The biopsies didn't show any malignancy.

692
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,160
There's something in the mesorectum
and it doesn't seem normal.

693
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,746
We have no choice
but to do a surgical biopsy.

694
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,673
When Dr. Jeon spoke during the briefing,
we learned he was a leukemia patient.

695
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,674
Right.

696
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,510
After that, two biopsies were done.

697
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,137
But they didn't come out as malignant.

698
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,182
Based on the CT and MRI scans…

699
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,811
Are you okay?

700
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,688
This too shall pass.

701
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,235
You've been staring
at something for a while. What is it?

702
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,820
It's a little weird.

703
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,948
This is the abdominal CT scan
of the patient, Choi Gyeong-su.

704
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,534
This is what was taken in the ER.

705
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,704
And this was taken
after the biopsy was done.

706
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,375
There seems to be a tiny decrease in size.

707
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,501
Really?

708
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,964
I can't really tell.

709
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,636
Maybe this isn't cancer tissue but…

710
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:11,972
An abscess?

711
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,059
It's not common, but I thought it may be
an abscess in the rectal diverticulum.

712
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,937
Sure, you know that it's not common.

713
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,524
Don't you think it's weird
that you found a rare condition

714
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:27,112
with one CT scan, Dr. Cha Jeong-suk?

715
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,032
I remember I had a similar case
when I was an intern.

716
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,493
If it's an abscess,
you don't have to put a sick patient

717
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,538
through a surgical biopsy
and can just drain it.

718
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,873
Forget it.

719
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,418
This decision was made after MRI,
CT, and even PET-CT scans were taken.

720
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,088
An abscess?
What in the world are you talking about?

721
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,299
Don't say I didn't warn you.

722
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,178
Are you, a first-year resident,
challenging me, a professor?

723
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,139
That's right, I gave it a shot.

724
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,017
But if I'm right,

725
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,853
allow me to work again.

726
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,274
What if you're wrong?

727
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,777
Are you going to quit or something?

728
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,279
Fine.

729
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,323
If I'm wrong,

730
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,242
I'll quit.

731
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,661
Deal.

732
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,085
Reserve a surgery room
for Mr. Choi Gyeong-su's biopsy.

733
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,921
I'll perform it myself.

734
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,176
Keep your promise.

735
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,928
You keep yours.

736
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:49,903
Lift it up more.

737
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,738
To the left.

738
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,700
If you go straight in like this,
it'll definitely come out.

739
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,076
Just like this…

740
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,877
The biopsy results
for Choi Gyeong-su came out.

741
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:06,878
What is it?

742
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:15,804
Damn it.

743
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,466
-Doctor, I'll take over now.
-What?

744
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,093
Professor Seo In-ho said
that I can take over now.

745
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,512
-Thank you.
-That's a relief.

746
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,306
All right then.

747
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,267
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

748
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,061
Hello.

749
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,898
You're a surgeon.
Why are you here getting acupuncture?

750
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,817
I'm trying out everything.

751
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,780
If it means getting better quickly,

752
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,909
I'd be willing to put anything
on my shoulder.

753
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,369
When you have time,
put a hot compress on it.

754
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,498
Doctor, it's time for Kim Min-su's Chuna…

755
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,917
Okay. Rest up.

756
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,834
Okay.

757
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,764
Hello.

758
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,142
Hello, Mr. Seo.
I'm I-rang's homeroom teacher.

759
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,438
Yes, hello.

760
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,107
I wanted to discuss
I-rang's college admissions,

761
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,902
but Ms. Cha isn't answering her phone.

762
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,904
That's why I called you.

763
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,156
I see. You can speak to me about it.

764
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,368
I-rang wants to apply for
Hanguk University's College of Fine Arts.

765
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,286
They pick according to grades,

766
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,705
so she'll have no trouble
making it past the first round.

767
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,706
Wait.

768
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:08,416
Yes.

769
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,211
It's hard for me to talk
on the phone right now.

770
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,088
Yes.

771
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,048
I'll call you back.

772
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,174
Yes.

773
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,229
We finished quickly.
Are you just going to go home?

774
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,106
I'm going to go see my mom
at the hospital.

775
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,692
I see. The person who came
to pick you up last time?

776
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,151
She was really pretty.

777
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,070
-Really?
-Yes.

778
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,363
She looked like she could be your aunt.

779
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,575
Are you strong, mentally speaking?

780
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,535
I think I'm average.

781
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,870
Why do you ask?

782
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,206
You're in 12th grade.

783
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,668
No matter what happens,
you need to stay strong.

784
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,758
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT

785
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,192
I'm home--

786
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,798
-Come on, let go of me!
-Honey, please.

787
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,217
-I said I'm just going to go home!
-No, gosh.

788
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,554
Hey, they said my X-ray results were fine.
Why aren't you letting me go home?

789
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,267
You may be fine now,
but there could be internal bleeding.

790
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,978
-You've been drinking, right?
-Yes.

791
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,021
-So just stay here a bit longer.
-Hey.

792
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,732
Do you think I can't tell
you're overcharging me because I'm drunk?

793
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,858
Stop cursing!

794
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,110
-Don't hit him.
-I'm sorry.

795
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,612
Sir, please sit down for now.

796
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,073
You're angry
because I'm not letting you leave, right?

797
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:48,159
-Dr. Cha. Please hurry up and come here.
-Okay.

798
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,704
-Please keep an eye on him.
-Okay.

799
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,913
We need an IV drip here.

800
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:52,914
-Yes.
-Gosh.

801
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,375
-Why are you acting like this?
-Stop it!

802
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,254
Drink this and sober up!

803
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,842
You shouldn't have drunk
and tripped in the first place.

804
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,218
That's enough!

805
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,179
Sir, please lie down.

806
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,434
Gosh.

807
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,645
Gosh, honey!

808
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,938
Doctor!

809
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,649
-I'll take a look.
-Okay.

810
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,276
Sir?

811
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,694
Sir, are you all right?

812
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,821
-Bring the crash cart.
-Okay.

813
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:25,864
Honey.

814
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,574
Sir!

815
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,584
See you tomorrow.

816
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,256
Right.

817
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,884
Patient Lee Yeong-bok
went into emergency surgery.

818
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,344
It was a spontaneous mesenteric hematoma.

819
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,180
The bleeding must have resumed

820
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,849
after it was temporarily pressed
between the intestines.

821
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,351
It wasn't obvious because
his blood pressure was stable for a while.

822
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,063
That's such a relief.

823
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,940
Why didn't you let him go home?

824
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,903
There was no fracture
or any other abnormal sign.

825
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,529
Well…

826
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,240
I touched his abdominal area,

827
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:13,244
and his abdominal guarding seemed unusual
even for someone drunk.

828
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,955
I thought he had some muscle stiffness.

829
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:20,210
So I stopped him
from being discharged just in case.

830
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,842
You did a good job.

831
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,536
Oh, my.

832
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,871
Aren't you Eun-seo? I-rang's friend?

833
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,790
Hello.

834
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,583
But why are you here?

835
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,503
I came to meet my mom.

836
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,341
Your mom works here?

837
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,467
She's a doctor, right?

838
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,302
-Yes.
-Eun-seo.

839
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,387
Mom.

840
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:19,686
I recently heard your daughter
and Eun-seo are friends.

841
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,731
What an interesting relationship we have.

842
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,192
I'll get going first. Let's go.

843
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,630
JUST SILENCE

844
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,036
Where's Dad?

845
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,246
Indoor golfing.

846
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,415
I hear indoor golf centers are
the hottest place for affairs.

847
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:31,025
I recently heard your daughter
and Eun-seo are friends.

848
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,486
What an interesting relationship we have.

849
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,206
Professor.

850
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,876
You don't run at full speed in a marathon.

851
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,546
Do you think you actually
are Hany or something?

852
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,466
What brings you here?

853
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,057
I have something to tell you.

854
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,101
Something to tell me?

855
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,437
What do you--

856
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,230
It's something very important.

857
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,650
If I don't tell you today,

858
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,319
I might never be able to.

859
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,712
DOCTOR CHA

860
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,486
Why would that young professor
like a mother of two?

861
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,447
I'm saying working close together
may lead to it.

862
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,616
That punk knows about us.

863
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,953
If you want to tell Dr. Cha about us,
go ahead.

864
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,247
You've never experienced
what I have either.

865
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,249
It seems like someone is trying to jump.

866
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:55,169
Dr. Cha went to dissuade him
because she's his doctor.

867
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:04,137
