00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,776
Professor.

3
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,029
You don't run at full speed in a marathon.

4
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,115
Do you think you actually
are Hany or something?

5
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,035
What brings you here?

6
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,626
I have something to tell you.

7
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,670
Something to tell me?

8
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,923
What do you--

9
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,050
It's something very important.

10
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,302
If I don't tell you today,

11
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,638
I might never be able to.

12
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,268
-The reason I came here today…
-Excuse me, who are you?

13
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,603
EPISODE 7

14
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,521
Mother.

15
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,148
This is my mother-in-law.

16
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,116
What could be urgent enough to warrant
holding onto my daughter-in-law

17
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,826
this late at night?

18
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,035
It's not like that.

19
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,746
He's a professor from the hospital.

20
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,791
He's the one
who performed my liver transplant.

21
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,376
Do you not remember?

22
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,129
You are that doctor.

23
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,005
Hello.

24
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,758
Yes, hello.

25
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,137
But what brings you here?

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,682
I live nearby as well.

27
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,060
I ran into her while I was out on a walk.

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,856
I should get going.

29
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,649
Dr. Cha, see you tomorrow.

30
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,568
Yes, get home safely.

31
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,077
I know you're not that type,

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,873
but even if the hospital
doesn't know about you and In-ho,

33
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,083
you still always have
to watch your behavior.

34
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,670
You can't do anything that'll bring
disgrace to him, don't you think?

35
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,588
Right.

36
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,799
Mother, you're late today.

37
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,176
-Did you stop by somewhere?
-Yes.

38
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,639
This month's maintenance bill is so high.

39
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,892
Why is the maintenance bill so high?

40
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,560
Let's go.

41
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,734
Gosh.

42
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,569
What is all of this?

43
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,697
Why are you kneeling?

44
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,325
Mother, you should head to your room.
Jeong-suk, sit with me.

45
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,076
Goodness, fine.

46
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,537
I think you guys will have
to solve this on your own.

47
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,039
Gosh, my head.

48
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,933
Did you know that
I-rang was preparing for art school?

49
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,270
-That…
-I'm sure you didn't just know.

50
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,231
You were probably helping her.

51
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,775
Honey, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

52
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,943
How long has this been going on?

53
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,403
When she was in tenth grade,

54
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,198
she said she wanted to go to art school
but changed her mind.

55
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,700
Were both of you putting on an act?

56
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,578
-That's not true.
-Then when did this start?

57
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,331
When did you all start
preparing for art school

58
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,417
while lying to your whole family?

59
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,421
Do you know how much I pour
into her education every month?

60
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,674
Have you been using that money
to buy this junk?

61
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,467
It hasn't been long.

62
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,594
I-rang really wants to do this.

63
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,263
She wants to pursue art.

64
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,182
Seo I-rang, cat got your tongue?

65
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,976
You'll be an adult next year.

66
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,395
What do you have to say
about your college admissions?

67
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,897
I've told you more than enough before

68
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,942
that I want to go to art school.

69
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,778
But to you, my future was set in stone.

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,324
That's right.

71
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,159
It is set in stone.

72
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,371
Bring me a trash bag.

73
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,665
Honey.

74
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,379
Honey, don't do this!

75
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,341
Honey, please.

76
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,219
Mother, please help me.

77
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,849
-Please just stop!
-Goodness, stop it!

78
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,727
-I-rang, what are you doing?
-Stop it!

79
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,646
Apologize to your father
and tell him you'll study hard.

80
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,814
Gosh, what's with him?

81
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,482
-Please don't be like this.
-Stop!

82
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,361
-Honey, don't be like this.
-In-ho, stop.

83
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,780
Hey, enough!

84
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,949
Why are you being so stubborn?

85
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,452
-Honey, don't be like this.
-In-ho, stop this.

86
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,955
Stop! Stop already!

87
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,165
Hey!

88
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,207
My goodness.

89
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,792
Stop this now.

90
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,044
Goodness.

91
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,297
Gosh!

92
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,049
Why won't you listen?

93
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,735
Do you have to go that far?

94
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,155
Your child wants
to do something so passionately.

95
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,574
If you can't be supportive,
at least leave her be.

96
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,701
Is a doctor the only job
that's acceptable for you?

97
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,537
If you want to send I-rang to art school,

98
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,331
you should quit working at the hospital.

99
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,834
What?

100
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,170
Did you think you could
have everything your way?

101
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,047
I'm the head of the family.

102
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,634
If you gain something,
you should be prepared to lose something.

103
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,262
What kind of ridiculous logic is that?

104
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,431
Why would I quit the hospital?

105
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,227
I'm going to send her to art school

106
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,355
and continue to work at the hospital.
Don't order me around.

107
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,397
Is that so?

108
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,360
Then handle everything from her tuition
to her art school entrance prep.

109
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,571
You have a job now.
You're more than capable of doing that.

110
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,450
Fine. Since you have fed, sheltered,
and clothed us until now,

111
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,576
I'll handle it from now on.

112
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,790
Thank you so much
for feeding me this whole time.

113
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,308
You can use this
and leave it here after you're done.

114
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,020
Thank you.

115
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,173
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT
WINNING WORK

116
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,699
What?

117
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,743
If you have something to say, say it.

118
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,463
Seung-hi's daughter.

119
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,466
She's I-rang's friend.

120
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,012
To tell you the truth,

121
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,806
ever since I found out
Seung-hi worked at the hospital,

122
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,267
I felt uncomfortable.

123
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,898
What's more, I-rang's friend turned out
to be Seung-hi's daughter.

124
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,317
I ran into them at the hospital.

125
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,154
How should I interpret all of this?

126
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,956
I can't do anything about you
feeling uncomfortable.

127
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,459
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Seung-hi working at our hospital.

128
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,172
But I already explained
why I didn't tell you.

129
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,634
And I also just learned that I-rang
and Seung-hi's daughter are friends.

130
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,804
But they're grown-up kids.
I can't stop them from being friends.

131
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,724
What about the bracelet?

132
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,648
What about it?

133
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,859
Never mind.

134
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,945
If you're going to continue
to be like this,

135
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,407
we can't work at the same hospital.

136
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,364
Dad treated my art like trash.

137
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,284
I-rang.

138
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,412
I'll make sure you can study art.

139
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,251
I'm going to keep my promise
and stay by your side until the end.

140
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,921
I should've told your dad
from the beginning,

141
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,673
but I was foolish.

142
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,802
I'm sorry for making you
hide your dream all this time.

143
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,971
Mom, you're so naive.

144
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,141
How will you send me to art school?

145
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,519
The summer college admissions lecture
for art school is 12 million won.

146
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,980
If you add the consulting
and the art project report edits,

147
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,148
it'll be 20 to 30 million won.

148
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,566
Do you have that much money?

149
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,778
It's that expensive?

150
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,789
What brings you here at this hour?

151
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,084
Eun-seo knows I-rang?
I heard they're friends.

152
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,127
I found out only recently too.

153
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,712
You should have told me!

154
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,464
How did they become friends?

155
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,799
Was it really a coincidence?

156
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,717
Don't talk to me
like you're interrogating me.

157
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,260
We created this situation together.

158
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,596
Why should I always be the one at fault?

159
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,598
That's not what I meant.

160
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,393
Do I have to be
your family's peacekeeper too?

161
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,104
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,730
I…

163
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,858
I was just shocked
when I heard the news from my wife.

164
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,403
What on earth should we do
about those two?

165
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,988
We can't tell two grown kids
not to be friends.

166
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,950
It's just because they go
to the same academy now.

167
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,869
They'll grow apart
once they get into different universities.

168
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,166
But is that why you came
all the way here at this hour?

169
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,347
We can give you 5.5 million won for this.

170
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,516
Can you buy it at a higher price?

171
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,809
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,394
Do you want to reconsider?

173
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,275
No, I will accept that price.

174
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,777
And this…

175
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,409
Please appraise this as well.

176
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,339
What kind of room did you reserve?

177
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,592
Sorry?

178
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,010
My hospital room.

179
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,386
I'll be admitted the day after tomorrow.

180
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,805
What kind of room did you reserve?

181
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,810
Mother, I'll reserve
a private room for you.

182
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,689
You'd be uncomfortable sharing
the same space with strangers.

183
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,442
But Mother…

184
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,695
-do you have money--
-How could you?

185
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:04,325
Not a single soul in this family
is even worried about me.

186
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,413
Mother, I'm sorry.

187
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:24,386
-Heal me now, my Savior, Jesus
-Heal me now, my Savior, Jesus

188
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,767
-Touch and mend my ailing frame
-Touch and mend my ailing frame

189
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,980
-I will heal all thy diseases
-I will heal all thy diseases

190
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:40,361
-That promise, Lord, I claim
-That promise, Lord, I claim

191
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:45,491
-See me, Lord, expectant kneeling
-See me, Lord, expectant kneeling

192
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:50,746
-Confident in faith appealing
-Confident in faith appealing

193
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,542
-Now Thy mighty power revealing…
-Now Thy mighty power revealing…

194
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,753
Right, you haven't sent the minutes
for the morning meeting yet.

195
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,255
Right.

196
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,839
I haven't finished organizing them.

197
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,425
I'll send them before noon.

198
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,515
Dr. Choi.

199
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,394
I'm sorry to ask,

200
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,021
but could you tell me…

201
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,024
where you bought that bracelet?

202
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,986
Why do you have to be sorry
for asking me that?

203
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,282
My husband bought it for me,
so I don't know where he got it.

204
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,201
Husband…

205
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,246
I see, your husband bought it for you.

206
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,046
She has

207
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,673
a husband.

208
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,484
Did I commit such an unforgivable sin
by being a single mother

209
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,403
giving birth to and raising you abroad?

210
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,822
Yes, having me was a sin.

211
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,700
Do you remember the girl you saw
when you came to pick me up?

212
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,118
Do you know who she is?

213
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,495
She's my sister.

214
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,916
-What?
-She's Seo In-ho's daughter.

215
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,584
I became friends with her.

216
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,586
I even went to their house.

217
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,422
I saw how Dad was living with that woman.

218
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,799
Are you crazy?

219
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,343
What do you think you're doing?

220
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,802
It's better than what you did!

221
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,222
You seduced a married man,
had an affair, and had a kid with him!

222
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,683
That's why we lived in the US
for 15 years!

223
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,101
I didn't want you to be hurt,

224
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,646
so I lied to you
that your father and I were divorced!

225
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,691
I tried my hardest to raise you
so you didn't have to endure that pain.

226
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,901
Too bad.

227
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,487
All that effort was for nothing.

228
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,031
I've become an extremely twisted person.

229
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,160
You don't know the full story.

230
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,456
I was first.

231
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,878
Your father and I liked each other
before all of this happened.

232
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,090
You and Dad liked each other first?

233
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,552
Then why are you living like this?

234
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,820
I take back…

235
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,906
what I said before.

236
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,741
I was being too harsh.

237
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,786
I'm sorry I doubted you.

238
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,998
Let's not talk about Seung-hi anymore.

239
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,376
What about I-rang?

240
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,338
I-rang was so unhappy
when she gave up on art.

241
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,509
But consulting you would have turned
the entire household upside down.

242
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,929
So I chose the easy option.

243
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,181
In the end, you did what you wanted

244
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,225
for something that was important.

245
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,769
Jung-min became a doctor
just as you wanted,

246
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,313
so you should be able
to cut I-rang some slack.

247
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,943
Just let her go to art school
like she prepared.

248
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,195
Art is done by geniuses
with exceptional talent.

249
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,239
Do you think I-rang
is one of those people?

250
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,409
She's our daughter.
She's smart but not artistic.

251
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,994
I know she's our kid, but please…

252
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,331
Be more objective.

253
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,959
Then what about her dream?

254
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,052
Dreams aren't meant to be achieved.

255
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,889
Tell her to keep it as a hobby.

256
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,313
I heard you have to keep
drinking cold beverages

257
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,231
after having surgery for thyroid cancer.

258
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,069
I was just about to get tired
of drinking ice water.

259
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,862
My goodness,

260
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:56,450
you must have worked so hard
to make all of this.

261
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,786
Just think this is on behalf
of your busy daughter-in-law.

262
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,413
My cooking isn't so bad,

263
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,041
so what I prepared should be better
than the hospital food.

264
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,542
Make sure you eat the porridge.

265
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,337
I'll put the rice punch
and cinnamon punch in the fridge.

266
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,755
Drink them whenever you can.

267
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,673
Thank you.

268
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,634
I'll be sure to enjoy them.

269
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,639
Don't you resent my mother-in-law?

270
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,141
I do.

271
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,978
How could I not resent her
after what she did

272
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,814
when you had your surgery?

273
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,234
I don't think
I'd be able to do it if I were you.

274
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,571
I did this because I thought
it'd bring you some good karma.

275
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,115
And…

276
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,328
you made the right decision
to keep working at the hospital.

277
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,539
Women need to have work too.

278
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,415
Oh, my.

279
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,793
You said I was making
the right decision to quit.

280
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,754
You're my daughter,

281
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,674
so I have no choice
but to support you and your decisions.

282
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,850
Where is In-ho?

283
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,476
I don't see Jung-min either.

284
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,478
Excuse me.

285
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,480
Where is Professor Seo right now?

286
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,440
Why?

287
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,736
Yes, hello?

288
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,197
Yes, ma'am.

289
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,659
I know today
is I-rang's admissions counseling,

290
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,204
but I was suddenly put on night duty.

291
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,498
Yes, I'm so sorry.

292
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:27,916
Thank you.

293
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,836
Dr. Cha.

294
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,379
Professor.

295
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,465
You can clock out. I'll stay on duty.

296
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,843
I can't let you do that.

297
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,512
What kind of professor would
take a resident's night duty?

298
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,889
I'll be all right.

299
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,599
I think I'd be of more use

300
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,143
than a first-year resident.

301
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,187
That is true but…

302
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,063
You should go.

303
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,903
It's a bit shameless of me,
but I'll ask you this favor just once.

304
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,155
Professor, thank you so much.

305
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,826
Right. When you showed up
in front of my house that night,

306
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,204
didn't you say you had
something to tell me?

307
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,540
Right, that.

308
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,296
What should I do? I forgot what it was.

309
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,715
I see.

310
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,468
Okay.

311
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,553
I'll be right back then. Thank you.

312
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,979
Hello, Professor.

313
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,106
Yes, hello.

314
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,443
We saw each other
in front of my house recently.

315
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,612
I'm Professor Seo In-ho's mother.

316
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,572
Yes, I'm aware.

317
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,076
But were you admitted to the hospital?

318
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,370
Yes. For my thyroid surgery.

319
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,373
But…

320
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,169
are you close to my daughter-in-law?

321
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,968
She'll be quite clumsy
since she started working at an older age.

322
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,721
Even if she makes mistakes to some degree,
please be generous and forgive her.

323
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,684
She's doing well,
so you don't have to worry.

324
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,727
Then that's a relief.

325
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,312
If you'll excuse me.

326
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,991
That is ridiculous.
What are you even saying…

327
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,327
Why would that young professor
like a mother of two?

328
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,829
Who said anything…

329
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,040
Who said he likes her now?

330
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,294
I'm saying working close together
may lead to it.

331
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,509
How about you stop deceiving your wife?

332
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,470
You and Professor Choi Seung-hi.

333
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,890
It greatly irks me
to try and turn a blind eye

334
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,642
to what is happening.

335
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,021
It's not because of that.

336
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,442
Anyway, even if they are close,
it won't happen.

337
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,528
You don't know he came to see her
in front of our house, do you?

338
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,446
Our house?

339
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,281
He did say that he lives nearby,

340
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,241
and they ran into each other in passing.

341
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,368
But that could be an excuse.

342
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,955
They were talking to each other
in the hallway earlier too.

343
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,499
They seemed to be on great terms.

344
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,139
You must have an emergency surgery.

345
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,641
Why did you show up in front of our house?

346
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,562
I find it unpleasant.

347
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,111
Are you worried
I might expose your affair?

348
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,119
Don't worry. I didn't say anything.

349
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,462
Do you think I don't have

350
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,006
other topics to talk to her about?

351
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,010
Then what more do you have to tell her?

352
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,387
You're so full of yourself.

353
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,064
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

354
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,526
You're still at work at this hour
because of me.

355
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,487
I'm aware of your difficulties.

356
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,364
But…

357
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,074
I'm a working mom too.

358
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,827
This is about
your child's college admissions.

359
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,913
You should keep this kind
of appointment no matter what.

360
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,499
Right.

361
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,592
I-rang.

362
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,098
Sorry.

363
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,476
-I came so late, right?
-I had low expectations anyway.

364
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,895
What about the money?

365
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,772
Did you get it?

366
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,194
Let's go.

367
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,951
I said let's go.

368
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,377
You're hungry, right?

369
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,336
I'm starving.

370
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,797
I haven't eaten anything
since I was waiting for you.

371
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,923
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,258
Did you eat?

373
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,926
I haven't eaten either.

374
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,182
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

375
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,976
I'm sure you heard from the colon
and rectal surgery professor.

376
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,021
The liver metastasis is worsening
due to hematogenous metastasis

377
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,648
since the treatment has been delayed.

378
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:48,987
Thankfully, the cancer cells are
only on the surface and can be removed.

379
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,031
But if the treatment
is delayed any longer,

380
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,366
the cancer might invade
major liver blood vessels

381
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,202
and may make it difficult to operate on.

382
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,329
I know this is difficult,

383
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,914
but as of now,

384
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,084
the best option is to terminate
the pregnancy, perform surgery,

385
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,378
and receive chemotherapy.

386
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,846
What will you do?

387
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,599
What do you mean?
I told you I'm having this baby.

388
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,352
How can the baby be important
when your life is at stake?

389
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,562
Mom.

390
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,525
Just as I'm precious to you,
this baby is precious to me.

391
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,820
-I'm going to have this baby.
-But you have to live!

392
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,074
Why are you so obsessed
over a child that's not even born yet?

393
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,158
Stop it.

394
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,894
Is he the baby's father?

395
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,105
This person is an actor.

396
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,606
Right?

397
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:10,986
No.

398
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,904
He's not the baby's father.

399
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,579
CHA JEONG-SUK
ORDINARY ACCOUNT

400
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,762
-Hello.
-Hello.

401
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,347
Your car is nice.

402
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,391
I just got it.

403
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,018
It looks expensive.

404
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,770
-I got it on an OD.
-OD?

405
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,399
-An overdraft account?
-Yes.

406
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,072
Gosh, look how irresponsible she is.

407
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,741
An OD?

408
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,617
Dr. Jeon!

409
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,081
Can I get an overdraft account too?

410
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,251
-Unless you have bad credit, then yes.
-Up to how much?

411
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,296
It's about 100 million won
for interns and residents.

412
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,090
It depends on the bank,
so you should check.

413
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,009
Okay.

414
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,719
Thank you!

415
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,642
You said you had
no loans in your name, right?

416
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,643
Yes.

417
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,854
But you have a loan
against your real estate.

418
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,856
For 450 million won.

419
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:30,774
What?

420
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:35,487
How is that possible
when I don't own any real estate?

421
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,740
You have a building
under your name in Gyeonggi-do.

422
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,414
Mother, are you going out?

423
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,458
-Yes, Jeong-suk.
-Yes?

424
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,504
Go to the district office today
and make a seal.

425
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,590
A seal?

426
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,301
Yes, you need a seal
to buy and sell things.

427
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,721
You may need one when taking care
of things for the household.

428
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,973
You should make one just in case.

429
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,060
And when you do, leave it with me, okay?

430
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,066
Should I issue a loan
using this building as collateral?

431
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,948
No, just make it a credit loan.

432
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,366
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,035
Excuse me.

434
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,122
The building under my name.

435
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,749
Can I get the address to it?

436
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,846
She always said she didn't have any money.

437
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,141
The special lecture fee?

438
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,934
Yes.

439
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,019
I paid the academy.

440
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,106
Where did you get the money?
There's no way Dad helped.

441
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,692
You don't need to know that.

442
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,821
Don't worry about money and work hard
on getting into that art school.

443
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,699
Pursuing art will sour things
with your dad,

444
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,660
so you have to take responsibility
for your actions, okay?

445
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,956
Come on, how did you get the money?

446
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,626
I have a job now.

447
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,962
I got a credit loan for workers.

448
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,591
I know you don't like that I work,
but you do at times like this, right?

449
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,134
I know you do.

450
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,721
I know you love it.
It makes you want to laugh.

451
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,474
Mom, thank you.

452
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,519
This is a 32-year-old male patient
suffering from Crohn's disease

453
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,981
and it looks like he had been suffering
from diverticulitis in his sigmoid colon.

454
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,485
The inflammation in that area worsened,
and on April 22nd in Busan,

455
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,780
he received Hartmann's procedure
after being diagnosed with panperitonitis.

456
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,239
Since he's still young,

457
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,241
he wants to be able to defecate
through the anus.

458
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,453
He visited the outpatient clinic of
our Colon and Rectal Surgery Department

459
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,996
for a stoma reversal surgery.

460
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,290
I'm presenting this case to discuss
when to pursue the reversal surgery

461
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,709
and the current level
of Crohn's disease activity.

462
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,340
-Have you met the Hartmann patient?
-Yes, I have.

463
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,424
How is he?

464
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,011
He's stabilized mentally,
so I don't think it will be an issue…

465
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,013
-Hey, Seo Jung-min.
-Yes?

466
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,557
Sorry, but can you get me my phone
from my dorm room?

467
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,352
-Okay.
-Wait!

468
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,270
I'll get it for you.

469
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,192
I could just go get it…

470
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,044
Jeez, she must think Jung-min
is her lackey or something.

471
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,296
She always bosses him around.

472
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,260
What's with her passcode?

473
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,478
My goodness.

474
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,939
Look at all this.

475
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,692
Gosh.

476
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,529
There's no place to step
with all this mess.

477
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,241
Is this men's underwear?

478
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,536
She has a boyfriend?

479
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,580
Goodness.

480
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,791
Whoever that poor soul is,

481
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,751
I feel so bad for him.

482
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,922
Do you really want
to do that in this place?

483
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,594
How youthful.

484
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,814
What am I doing right now?

485
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,858
It's not like this is my daughter's room.

486
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,110
Her cell phone!

487
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,338
TO MY SON WHOM I LOVE, JUNG-MIN

488
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,686
This is Jung-min's underwear.

489
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,980
My son…

490
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,833
No way.

491
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,045
They're not thinking
of marriage, are they?

492
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,298
Thank you for the meal.

493
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,216
So-ra.

494
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,635
-What about the dishes?
-Mother.

495
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,179
Everyone here knows
how to wash the dishes.

496
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,139
If you and I prepared the meal,

497
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,810
then other people should clean it up.

498
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,485
Mother, I can't cut fruit well.

499
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,780
Wouldn't it be more efficient
for an expert to cut it

500
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,448
rather than have me mess it up?

501
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,412
Mother, these materials are for my paper,

502
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,664
so you should write them
according to the SOAP.

503
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,000
Do you want people to criticize
these poorly-written charts?

504
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,550
What's worse is that
everything she says is right.

505
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,143
Jung-min.

506
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,853
Yes.

507
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:42,770
Okay.

508
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,772
But you don't…

509
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,735
have a girlfriend, do you?

510
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,611
I don't.

511
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,531
I said I don't.

512
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,994
I'm telling you the truth.

513
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,621
Let's talk later.

514
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,707
Okay.

515
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,048
What were you talking about?

516
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,592
Is someone asking you for money?

517
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,471
Yes, I told them I don't have any money.

518
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:18,765
Good job.

519
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,060
But what is your mother like?

520
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,148
Why do you ask?

521
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,152
I was wondering if she gets along
with Professor Seo.

522
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,740
Is this about that rumor
about Dr. Cha and my father?

523
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,203
There's nothing going on between them.

524
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,420
I'm not asking because of that, you punk.

525
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:51,923
"You punk"?

526
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,467
You keep trying to rile me up.

527
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,429
How can you call your boyfriend "punk"?

528
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,099
I can do what I want, you punk.

529
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,814
Wait for me.

530
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,622
Thank you for bringing my phone.

531
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,874
Do you have something to say?

532
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,585
Dr. Jeon.

533
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,089
Do you have a boyfriend?

534
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,173
Yes.

535
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,925
I do, why?

536
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,386
Who is it?

537
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,390
Why does it feel
like I'm being interrogated here?

538
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,808
Goodness.

539
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,478
I'm not interrogating.
I was just being curious, that's all.

540
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,148
Who's your boyfriend?

541
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,899
Is it someone I know?

542
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,654
I'm not going to tell you.

543
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,781
I don't care that you're curious.

544
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,450
I have no reason
to answer questions like that.

545
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,047
You!

546
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,886
Are you really dating that rude girl?

547
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,596
What?

548
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,724
He's pretending not to have a girlfriend.

549
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,893
What's the point of confirming the truth?

550
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,812
It'll just make
all three of us uncomfortable.

551
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,276
Dr. Seo.

552
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,196
I don't see your watch.

553
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,698
You always wear it.

554
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,494
Right, I forgot to wear it.

555
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,330
I took it off while showering.

556
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,374
At a friend's house.

557
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,085
I knew it.

558
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,839
They've already gone
as far as they can go.

559
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,678
That punk takes after me.

560
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,279
I know things
are uncomfortable between us,

561
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,573
but let's talk when we eat together.

562
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,951
Sorry, it's not like that.

563
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,870
There aren't many famous art academies
in that neighborhood.

564
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,373
Your wife will just think of it like that
and move on.

565
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,877
That's not the full issue.

566
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,342
The new guy in my department,
Roy or whatever.

567
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,718
Sure, I know him.

568
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,513
He's the one who performed
your wife's liver transplant.

569
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,265
That punk knows.

570
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:48,975
About us.

571
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,143
How?

572
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,521
I don't know how he found out,
but he knows.

573
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,608
He's acting all high and mighty
because he thinks he knows my weakness.

574
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,403
It pisses me off.

575
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,156
What are you going to do?

576
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,368
What can that punk do?

577
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,038
It's none of his business.

578
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,888
May I sit down?

579
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,765
Of course.

580
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,444
Do you have something to say?

581
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,281
I have no intention of breaking up
with Professor Seo.

582
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,328
That's interesting.

583
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,872
Why are you making that confession to me?

584
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,790
Because I have no one else to tell.

585
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,251
Then you should try
talking to a wall instead.

586
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,422
If you want
to tell her about us, go ahead.

587
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,467
To Dr. Cha.

588
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,512
Are you asking me
to break up a family for you?

589
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,057
I don't care what you think.

590
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,017
For whose benefit would I do that?

591
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,895
Don't try to use me.

592
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,066
I thought you were a bit better
than Professor Seo.

593
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,276
I'm greatly disappointed.

594
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
Professor.

595
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,545
Do you need to speak to me
about something?

596
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,005
Don't smile.

597
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,134
You have something in your teeth.

598
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,823
I'm stressed.

599
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,785
Over here.

600
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,037
Gosh, Ms. Kwak.

601
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,247
You got here before me.

602
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,583
Yes. I left early
because it's been a while

603
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,919
since I've been out.

604
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,588
Since I was late,
I should give you this first.

605
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,006
Open it.

606
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,008
Oh, my, this is a designer brand.

607
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,896
Goodness, it's a scarf.

608
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,733
You seemed to be always bothered
by that scar on your neck.

609
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,361
You can cover it with this pretty scarf.

610
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,990
Once the seasons change,
I'll get you one in a different color.

611
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,450
My goodness.

612
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,785
Try it on.

613
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,038
I think it will suit you well
since you have such fair skin.

614
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,542
Thank you.

615
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,421
I've been feeling so weak these days.

616
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,425
I'm so touched by this.

617
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,262
-I'll try it on.
-Okay.

618
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,725
It's pretty.

619
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,185
Does it cover it up well?

620
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,730
-I feel so reinvigorated.
-Yes.

621
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,648
I'm in such a good mood.

622
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,163
Professor, you can't look at the camera.

623
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,664
Okay.

624
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,760
Ma'am, how is your pain?

625
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,970
It's slowly getting better.

626
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,472
But it still hurts.

627
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,265
You will get better in time.

628
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,268
It'll improve slowly. Are you eating well?

629
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,438
I'm managing to eat, but I can't seem
to have a bowel movement.

630
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,356
Goodness.

631
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,108
It'd be great if you'd give me
some constipation medicine.

632
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,319
I'll let the doctor in charge of you know.

633
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,446
Is everything else fine?

634
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,697
Yes.

635
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,492
Professor, you're very friendly today.

636
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,453
You don't know how frustrated I've been

637
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,082
because you'd always rush out of here
before I could ask you anything.

638
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,920
Is that so?

639
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,182
It's just that I have a lot of patients.

640
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,898
The adhesion is worse than I thought.

641
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,900
Connecting it won't be easy.

642
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,821
I'm worried the sigmoid colon
might not come down far enough.

643
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,156
Can we get the splenic flexure further?

644
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,283
It's at its limit.

645
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,328
His pelvis is narrow,
and the length is barely making it.

646
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,456
-Move it down. Let's try to connect it.
-Yes, sir.

647
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,710
-I'm inserting the body.
-Slowly.

648
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,503
Yes, good.

649
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,671
Go forward with the spike.

650
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,715
Yes, going forward with the spike.

651
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:13,966
Go all the way in.

652
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,426
Okay.

653
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,553
I'm going to staple it now. Fire.

654
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,846
Firing.

655
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,306
Please pass me the water.

656
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,643
Put it all in.

657
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,938
Shoot it in again.

658
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,819
It's slightly leaking.

659
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,539
Let's reinforce it. Do we have glue?

660
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,333
-Let's apply some first.
-Okay.

661
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,835
It can't be helped.
We'll have to go with a diversion.

662
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,129
-There's no way around it.
-Okay.

663
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,302
Professor, are you all right?

664
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,054
My arm.

665
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:01,847
I can't move it.

666
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,728
We pulled the stoma
and put in the Hemovac drain.

667
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,105
All we need to do is close the stomach
and maturate the stoma.

668
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,565
Call in a fellow now.

669
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,871
We tried to perform the stoma reversal.

670
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,624
But the tissue
wasn't as healthy as we thought,

671
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,626
and the length wasn't long enough either.

672
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,129
For now, we have constructed
a temporary ileostomy

673
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,591
so that no feces pass
through the anastomosis area.

674
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:42,137
Then can you really remove
the stoma next time?

675
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,556
Let's monitor your progress.

676
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,892
Gosh, if I knew your arm was that bad,

677
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,561
I wouldn't have asked you
for such a cumbersome favor.

678
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,146
Why didn't you tell me?

679
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,149
I didn't want to inconvenience
the department.

680
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,027
I apologize for the trouble, Chief.

681
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,278
There's no need for that.

682
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,572
You were the perfect man
for the broadcast.

683
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,408
Who will I recommend now?

684
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,435
Why does he look so cool?

685
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,479
Isn't this the patient
that took aspirin as heart medication?

686
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,446
Did this patient stop taking aspirin?

687
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,114
How long has it been?

688
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,701
I didn't check.

689
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,287
Well…

690
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,999
The patient stopped taking it
after being admitted yesterday.

691
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,834
I'm sorry.

692
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,961
Why do you fail to check
important things on time?

693
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,797
If I hadn't asked,
you wouldn't have checked,

694
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,258
and the patient would've taken aspirin
until it was time for the surgery!

695
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,391
Where are you going?

696
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,186
Well, I…

697
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,815
was going to go watch…

698
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,625
My shoulder.

699
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,280
Are you going to stay stubborn?

700
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,241
Why do something you'll obviously regret?

701
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,909
It's my life. I'll be the judge of that.

702
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,954
Did you make that life on your own?

703
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:15,207
Jung-min listened to you,
went to med school, and became a doctor.

704
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,668
Do you think he's satisfied
and happy with his life?

705
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,965
Jung-min wanted to major in communications
and become a variety show producer.

706
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,133
You didn't know that, did you?

707
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,428
He didn't even mention it
because he knew you'd laugh.

708
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,181
Jung-min listened to you so well,

709
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,978
but he seems to be
awfully regretting it now.

710
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,316
That little punk.

711
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,707
-You weren't in the surgery room?
-It finished early.

712
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,924
Where are you going?

713
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:11,471
I have to go push for an examination.

714
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,016
Give me a kiss before you go.

715
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,601
A kiss?

716
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,360
What are you doing here?

717
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,405
Doctor, what should we do
about my husband?

718
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,657
What's wrong?

719
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,369
He keeps saying he doesn't want to live
and that he wants to die.

720
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,956
I'm scared that something might happen.

721
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,879
It's not uncommon to feel that way
after a failed surgery.

722
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,673
But his biggest source of strength
right now is his family.

723
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,508
Please try your best to comfort him.

724
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,136
Will he really be okay?

725
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,725
I'm back to where I started.

726
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:00,103
With two holes on each side of me.

727
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,649
When your condition improves,

728
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,194
you'll be able to undergo
the surgery again.

729
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,697
Right, have you exercised?

730
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:15,077
You have to keep moving
to stimulate your intestines.

731
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,289
I went up to the roof before.

732
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,625
Why the roof?

733
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,419
I wondered if I would feel at peace
if I died there.

734
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,548
It would have been better if this was
something I'd die of in a few months.

735
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,468
But the thought of having
to live like this forever

736
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,887
makes me feel so hopeless.

737
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,266
Goodness, you shouldn't say
things like that.

738
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:42,729
You're only saying that because
you don't know how hopeless it really is

739
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,148
to have death staring at you in the face.

740
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,320
You've never experienced
what I have either.

741
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,699
I don't know if I'll be able
to work again,

742
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,910
if I can maintain my marriage,
or if I should have kids.

743
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,955
I have no certainty

744
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,290
as to how I should live.

745
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:17,931
Dr. Jeon.

746
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,434
The patient, Hwang Seon-gyu.

747
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,311
I think he's suffering
from severe depression.

748
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,063
I'm aware.

749
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,441
His wife seemed very worried.

750
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,444
Shouldn't we consult
the Psychiatry Department?

751
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,029
More than half of Crohn's patients
are in their twenties and thirties.

752
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,866
So it's natural that they feel hopeless.

753
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,285
It's even more so for him
since it's post-surgery.

754
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,245
But he'll be better soon.

755
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,122
If so, that's a relief.

756
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,625
I just feel for him.

757
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,045
He's at a similar age as my son.

758
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,132
You have a son?

759
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,179
I do.

760
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,557
My son is very precious to me.

761
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,895
You must have raised him
with great love and care.

762
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,230
I did.

763
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,025
But in the end,
all that effort was in vain.

764
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,151
Goodness.

765
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:19,034
Anyway, I think we should do what we can.

766
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,620
Could you please talk
to the professor about this?

767
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,121
Okay.

768
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,798
-Bring in the camera more.
-Okay.

769
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,137
But didn't this patient want
her uterine fibroids removed too?

770
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:43,683
I was going to ask her a final time,
but I never got around to it.

771
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,101
I asked her.

772
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,146
She wants to observe it first.

773
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,816
Really? Good job.

774
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,080
You normally don't even glance at me.

775
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,206
What's gotten into you?

776
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,583
Did you change your hairstyle?

777
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,629
What is with you?

778
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,882
You never noticed things about me,
even if I were to shave my head.

779
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,717
Why do you have to be so extreme?

780
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,427
I know I may be indifferent,

781
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,722
but how would I not realize
if you shaved your head?

782
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,599
I'm just saying.

783
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,979
Anyway, even though it's unlike you,
thanks for noticing.

784
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,234
Have you received cosmetic treatments too?

785
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,113
You've been exercising
and putting effort into your appearance.

786
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,075
My skin has always been good, okay?

787
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,213
Why do you look so pretty today?
You look great.

788
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,466
Just let Choi Seung-hi have Seo In-ho.

789
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,427
I will do that later.

790
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,346
It's so funny watching them snoop around.

791
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,521
Am I going crazy?

792
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,206
Mom, Dad, why did you come
without telling us?

793
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,834
We should come
since our son-in-law is sick.

794
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,170
Father, Mother.

795
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:38,006
You go out and buy us
some juice or something.

796
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,758
I'm dying of thirst.

797
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,511
Okay.

798
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,644
I'm ashamed to face both of you.

799
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:55,982
Goodness.

800
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,819
How could you hide this horrific disease
and marry our daughter?

801
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,156
How dare you ruin my daughter's life?
What on earth is this?

802
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,367
I'm sorry.

803
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,534
Seon-gyu.

804
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,578
I heard this disease is genetic.

805
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,040
Please give up on this marriage.

806
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:16,503
Even if my daughter says it's okay,
you should have given up on this marriage.

807
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,006
I wasn't hoping
you'd give my daughter a life of comfort.

808
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,759
But I can't bear seeing her
care for her sick husband

809
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:23,969
from the very beginning!

810
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,515
We are begging you. Please.

811
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,693
Seon-gyu.

812
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,695
Where are Mom and Dad?

813
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:45,991
Something urgent came up, so they left.

814
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,118
What? Without saying goodbye to me?

815
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,496
Did they say something to you?

816
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,665
No.

817
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,043
They told me not to worry
and to take care of myself.

818
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,712
What a relief.

819
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:02,924
Hey.

820
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:03,925
Yes?

821
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,137
You remember that cheonggukjang place
in Yangpyeong?

822
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,221
Yes.

823
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,724
I'm craving their cheonggukjang.

824
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,600
Could you go buy some for me?

825
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,360
Hello…

826
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,759
SEO-YEON, I'M SORRY
FOR MAKING THIS DECISION

827
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,927
BUT THE REST OF MY LIFE
SEEMS LIKE AN ENDLESS TUNNEL…

828
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,185
Hello? Is this 911?

829
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,312
I'm calling from the new wing
of Gusan University Hospital.

830
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,606
There's a patient
who's trying to commit suicide.

831
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,857
Please come quickly!

832
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,921
Mr. Hwang Seon-gyu.

833
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,303
Mr. Hwang Seon-gyu.

834
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,643
I'm sorry.

835
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,594
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

836
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,513
What is going on here?

837
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,557
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

838
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,102
What is all this commotion?
Is there a fire?

839
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,855
Judging by the air mats,
that doesn't seem to be the case.

840
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,190
It seems like someone is trying to jump.

841
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,026
It's the Crohn's disease patient
whose stoma reversal failed.

842
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,071
He wrote a suicide note
and went to the roof.

843
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,156
Isn't that my patient?

844
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,951
He's still so young.
Why would he make such a drastic choice?

845
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,035
It could be more hopeless

846
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:37,871
because he's young.

847
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,038
What?

848
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,708
Dr. Cha went to dissuade him

849
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,294
because she's his doctor.

850
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:54,929
Let's go down.

851
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,806
Your wife is waiting.

852
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,393
I can't live, and I can't die.

853
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,313
This is honestly so embarrassing.

854
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,482
There's no need to feel that way.

855
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,989
Are you okay?

856
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,033
I'll persuade him, so come over here.

857
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,368
He's my patient, so I'll persuade him!
He'll listen to me!

858
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,205
All right.

859
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,295
Let's go.

860
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,255
Let's go.

861
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:31,799
Okay?

862
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:49,984
Oh, no!

863
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,558
What a relief.

864
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,018
It's such a relief.

865
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,812
It's okay.

866
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,419
Sir, are you all right?

867
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,297
-Make preparations. We're bringing him in.
-He fell by accident.

868
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,256
We'll take it from here.

869
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,140
Are you crazy? Why would you go up there?

870
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,808
You almost died!

871
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,479
Are you okay?

872
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,035
I'm glad you're safe.

873
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,259
DOCTOR CHA

874
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,908
What could this be?
Maybe they are in a love triangle!

875
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,284
But how did you two become friends?

876
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,037
I think it's a little too late
for you to be asking me that.

877
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,873
You crazy bastard! A love child?

878
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:09,874
Does Mom know too?

879
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,834
Your mom doesn't know,
