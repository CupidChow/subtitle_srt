INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

4
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:05,375
Since you've waited this long,
let's wait a bit more.

5
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,586
A single opportunity may come.

6
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,714
And it will come soon.

7
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,989
In-ho, don't do it!

8
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,323
Don't sign it!

9
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,534
No! You absolutely can't!

10
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,911
No, I won't let you!

11
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,248
Mother.

12
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,210
No matter how much I think about this,
I can't let you have this surgery.

13
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,296
You should know better than I do
since you're a doctor.

14
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,090
There's no guarantee you'll be fine
after having that surgery.

15
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,216
Think of the kids.

16
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,304
One of you two
needs to stay healthy for them.

17
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,639
You can't. You'd have to kill me first.

18
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,392
Don't do it. Did you sign anything else?
I can't bear…

19
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,895
In-ho, please don't go through
with the surgery.

20
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,564
This is the first
and last favor I'll ask of you.

21
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,530
You can do it over my dead body.

22
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,240
I won't allow this!

23
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,158
I won't.

24
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,042
What?

25
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,211
He was about to sign the consent form,
but his mother showed up

26
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,505
and ripped the form,
screaming he can't do the surgery.

27
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,757
It was a complete mess.

28
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,467
So he's really not going to do it?

29
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,178
He says that he needs more time,

30
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,263
but that just means he can't.

31
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,099
I won't let you do this.

32
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,520
A TA patient was just declared
brain-dead in the intensive care unit.

33
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,272
Should I check the compatibility?

34
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,858
It might be possible
with Cha Jeong-suk's MELD score.

35
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,329
-Honey.
-Yes?

36
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, tell me. What is it?

37
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,795
What?

38
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,007
What did you say?

39
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,973
You…

40
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,557
little…

41
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,935
bastard.

42
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,663
Excuse me, the patient here has woken up!

43
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,653
"An opportunity will come," my foot.

SEOMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

46
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,041
I said you didn't have to come.

47
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,667
Still, you're getting discharged today.

48
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,712
I guess you wanted to do
at least one good thing.

49
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,799
Jeong-suk.

50
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,433
Do you remember what you said to me
in the recovery room after your surgery?

51
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,685
What did I say?

52
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,980
No, it must've been psychosis.

53
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,484
Some patients say
absurd things after surgery.

54
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,943
That's strange.

55
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,571
I'm not normally the type
to say absurd things.

56
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,400
Hey, welcome home.

57
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,860
Mother.

58
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,573
Welcome back after regaining your health.

59
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,997
Mother called a place
and had them disinfect the entire house.

60
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,250
Your immune system is weak
after a transplant,

61
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,668
so you're prone to infections.

62
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,379
Thank you, Mother.

63
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,588
You did well.

64
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:13,891
Your coffee.

65
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,647
-Mother, come sit down and eat.
-Okay.

66
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,945
Jeong-suk, do you want
to swing by Jay Department Store today?

67
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,071
The department store?

68
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,825
Yes. A handbag that I bought
a while ago just came in.

69
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,453
I waited six months,
so I was going to go pick it up myself,

70
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,746
but I have plans with a friend
who's back from the US after three years.

71
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,918
Don't give me that look.
My days are numbered now.

72
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,420
I bought one for the first time

73
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,839
by saving up the tiny amounts
I get from my pension.

74
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,259
You also bought a mink coat last winter.

75
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,761
I only had out-of-season winter clothes,

76
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,430
so I had no choice but to buy one.

77
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,224
Three months ago,
you bought a designer wallet,

78
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,393
and last month you
got an 800,000-won scarf…

79
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,311
Hey.

80
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,271
Why do you have such a good memory?

81
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,859
So are you saying that
you're going to go for me or not?

82
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,946
I'll go get it for you.

83
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,449
While I'm there,
I'll do some window shopping.

84
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,077
Sounds good. Do all
the window shopping you want.

85
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,370
Right, about the bag.

86
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,789
Don't just bring it home
like you did last time.

87
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,834
You know you have
to check meticulously for any flaws.

88
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,752
Yes.

89
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,086
Let's eat.

90
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,047
-Okay.
-Hurry up and sit.

91
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,383
Jung-min, you should eat slowly
or you'll get indigestion.

92
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,093
I don't even want to eat breakfast.

93
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,847
-I said I just wanted to sleep more.
-You still have to eat.

94
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,308
Interns don't have time for breakfast.

95
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,311
Mom, I said I want a croissant, not toast.

96
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,146
I toasted the bread. Have it with cheese.

97
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,065
And drink your milk.

98
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,108
What's with the coffee?

99
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,944
I bought new beans.

100
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,570
Just buy the ones we used to drink.

101
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,531
Why can't you understand
I hate the acidic taste?

102
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,494
Why do you speak so curtly to your wife?

103
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,329
In-ho.

104
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,499
Jeong-suk, is my juice not ready yet?

105
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,043
No, I'll have it ready for you soon.

106
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,505
Hey, Jeong-suk, goodness.
I told you not to scrimp

107
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,007
when it comes to buying
the ingredients for my juice.

108
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,010
Do you think juice made
from wilted ingredients will be healthy?

109
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,470
That's not detox juice,

110
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,680
but toxic juice.

111
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,306
Mom, I have to go.

112
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,350
-Where's my mask?
-Mask?

113
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,980
Eat some more, okay?

114
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,858
That was hilarious.

115
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,695
It went like this…

116
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,532
The realization of my loneliness
came out of the blue.

117
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,126
My beautiful family
that was so perfect and elegant.

118
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,337
What was I…

119
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,798
to them?

120
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,557
Wrap up the bottle of wine
on the first row of the wine cellar,

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,017
all the way on the right.

122
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,810
It's a gift to the hospital director.

123
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,103
Okay.

124
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,480
Hey, did you apply
for your disability rating yet?

125
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,065
Disability rating?

126
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,859
If you have a liver transplant,
you get a Grade Five.

127
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,029
Really?

128
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,489
But what's the point?
There aren't many benefits.

129
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,534
What are you talking about?
With parking so difficult these days,

130
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,578
it's great to park
in a disabled parking space.

131
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,829
The spot is great too.

132
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,748
You'll be able to apply online.

133
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,299
And about the new air purifier.

134
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,510
Is it the one
with the lowest price on the market?

135
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,430
These days, the prices can vary greatly

136
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,016
even for the same brand and product.

137
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,102
You can lose so much money
by buying from the wrong retailer.

138
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,228
Where did she go?

139
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,775
She went to look up the prices, jeez.

140
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:56,298
But for SUDD, if fecal calprotectin
is used as a biomarker,

141
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,801
then the reliability
in the diagnostic rate increases.

142
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,137
For unspecific symptoms like bloating,

143
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,013
pain, and altered bowel habits

144
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,142
often associated with IBS,

145
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,104
it's hard to confirm if image tests
like colonoscopy aren't conducted.

146
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,230
But for SUDD,

147
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,649
because the fecal calprotectin
comes out higher than normal…

00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,955
I keep getting texts that
it's being used at Jay Department Store.

151
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,208
During a colonoscopy,
the location of diverticula,

152
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,502
the number of diverticula
per colonic segment…

153
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,795
I'm the one using it.

154
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,139
I've brought out the bag
that Ms. Kwak Ae-sim ordered.

155
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:49,185
We checked in the morning
that there was nothing wrong with it.

156
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,813
But we prepared it so that
you can check for yourself as well.

157
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,899
It's okay. Just give it to me.

158
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,067
But still, you should still check it once…

159
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,153
No, it's fine. Just package it for me.

160
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,446
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,951
-Excuse me?
-Yes, ma'am.

162
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,204
Is there another one of those bags here?

163
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,165
Hello.

164
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,875
How are you feeling?

165
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,293
It still hurts.

166
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,337
It hurts?

167
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,756
Cough as much as you can.

168
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,591
You have to keep walking around

169
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,134
so you can release gas quickly.

170
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,303
-Make sure you walk, okay?
-Okay.

171
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,265
-How are you feeling?
-I've gotten a lot better.

00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,250
You guys can go ahead.

178
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:04,969
Where are you?

179
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,055
Where do you think? Cheongdam-dong.

180
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,139
What's your deal?

181
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,059
-You must have been quite shocked.
-Did you buy all those things?

182
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,062
Right, I didn't find
the lowest price on the market,

183
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,772
so we probably lost some money.

184
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,024
Why are you suddenly acting weird?

185
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,152
Maybe it's because I escaped death.

186
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,154
I wanted to start doing things
I hadn't done before.

187
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,531
Is that why you spent--

188
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,828
Are you crazy?
You could buy a car with all that money.

189
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,872
I spent the last 20 years
not doing stuff like this.

190
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,791
I always used the handbags, coats,
and other things

191
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,918
after your mother got tired of them.

192
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,753
But I've never considered
buying them myself.

193
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,340
I couldn't even make a credit card
since I had no job

194
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,634
and no assets under my name.

195
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,138
I had to go around with a credit card
that was under your name,

196
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,098
and I felt like I was being watched
every time I used it.

197
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,643
That's why I could never
spend money on myself,

198
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,439
like buying clothes or cosmetics,
or going to a salon.

199
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,773
Thank you.

200
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,443
-No one told you to live that way.
-Exactly.

201
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,030
You make good money,
and you even have a house you inherited.

202
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,323
So why did I live like that?

203
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,158
Why are you asking me that?

204
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,995
Because of my pride in wanting
to stay detached from your money?

205
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,791
Because I thought it was unreasonable
to spend money that I didn't earn myself?

206
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,252
I think those were the reasons.

207
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,213
-But?
-But all of that was pointless.

208
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,384
I want to live a little shamelessly
doing the things I want.

209
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,594
What?

210
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,931
I'm going to live
however I please from now on.

211
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,687
She hung up.

212
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,651
That was good.

213
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,652
So damn good.

214
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:49,198
Where were you hiding that
sharp tongue of yours this whole time?

215
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,075
You did well, okay?

216
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,494
You need to spend money
to learn how to spend it.

217
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,164
People think
I buy designer clothes every season

218
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,918
and travel abroad on vacation
because I got married into a rich family.

219
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,879
But my only asset is a house that required
taking out a large mortgage,

220
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,132
and my only source of income
is my husband's salary.

221
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,843
But I didn't dislike being misunderstood.

222
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,513
I'm a snob after all.

223
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,765
You would've been more well-off

224
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,725
if you lived alone and kept working.

225
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,603
You would've had a home and a car
under your name.

226
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,858
But still, I thought my life was perfect.

227
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,279
I may be at the bottom of the food chain
within my own household,

228
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,783
but on the outside, I'm the wife
of a prominent university hospital doctor

229
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,078
and a mother of a rich household
with smart kids.

230
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,790
Though I'm just a housewife now,
I felt superior to others

231
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,334
because I was an elite
who finished med school.

232
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,922
I stood tall and proud.

233
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:53,971
I thought I was living an upper-class life
that wasn't lacking by any standard.

234
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,473
But?

235
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,142
But…

236
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,104
after coming back from the brink of death,

237
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,481
it turns out all of that was meaningless.

238
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,350
How can you sleep?

239
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,395
I bet you were happy
when your mother stopped you,

240
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,355
even though your wife was dying.

241
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:50,152
Do you think I wouldn't know
that you felt relieved?

242
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,112
You're a hypocrite and a selfish prick

243
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,784
who acts as if you're the most ethical
and the most decent person in the world.

244
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,371
Through this opportunity,
I saw the real you, you horrible bastard.

245
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,007
Did you just slap me?

246
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,135
-Yeah.
-Why?

247
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,221
-Because I'm in a bad mood.
-What?

248
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,889
Do you get facial treatments?

249
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,308
Why is your skin so nice?

250
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,228
It seems like you haven't changed,
and I'm the only one who has gotten old.

251
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,564
You're mad that I have nice skin?

252
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,027
So you slapped me?

253
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,780
This was the first time
you've been slapped in the face, right?

254
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,615
Yes.

255
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,117
So what?

256
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,370
You slapped me to give me
an experience I'd never had before?

257
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,332
It felt like I was slapped
out of nowhere like that too.

258
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,752
I came to my senses after I got hit.

259
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,547
Why on earth are you being like this?

260
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,300
If someone has been
through something that big,

261
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,598
psychological changes can occur.

262
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,894
They could want to go shopping,
not do housework,

263
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,939
and show hostility toward
family members for no reason.

264
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,068
Right, that can happen.

265
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,778
I…

266
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,197
understand it all.

267
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,241
Do you really understand?

268
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,326
Yes.

269
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,829
I do understand.

270
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:30,252
So going forward,
just relax and focus on your recovery.

271
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,504
Don't worry about household chores,

272
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,965
and do some shopping
from time to time too.

273
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,303
I have to go to the bathroom.

274
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,930
You don't go to the bathroom
in the middle of the night.

275
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,848
I do.

276
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,148
Be careful.

277
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,776
Hypocrite.

278
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,423
Mom, what about breakfast?

279
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,927
Even if I prepare breakfast,
you barely eat, so I didn't bother.

280
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,763
If you want to eat something,
prepare it yourself.

281
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,238
I-rang, make your own breakfast
from now on. Your mom is exhausted.

282
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,031
What about my coffee?

283
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,784
I bought some capsules over there.
Drink those.

284
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,535
They're so easy to use.

285
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,996
-Why would I drink instant coffee?
-What do you mean?

286
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,249
You said I didn't have to worry
about the household chores anymore.

287
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,594
-Did Jung-min already leave?
-No, he didn't come home yesterday.

288
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,930
Hey, that's my…

289
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,641
What about my detox juice?

290
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,727
The ingredients for yours
are in the fridge.

291
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,437
You can make it yourself.

292
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,364
Mother, will you be okay with the juicer?

293
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,034
-Shall I teach you how to use it?
-It's fine. I'll figure it out myself.

294
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,953
Appliances are all the same.

295
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:28,870
Okay.

296
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,498
Right. Mother, here.

297
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,629
Please clean this too.

298
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,966
-Wait--
-Right. I'll be using the car today.

299
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,509
Hey…

300
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,347
What's with her?

301
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,064
Mom, it's still early.
Where are you going?

302
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,442
-To go eat brunch.
-Brunch?

303
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,528
-See you…
-I'll see you.

304
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,455
Thank you for the food.

305
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,956
Do you not have food at home?

306
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,667
Why did you barge into my house so early
asking for food?

307
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,296
This food is different though.
Your food is like medicine.

308
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,839
Don't even mention medicine.

309
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,509
If I think about how much
it made you suffer, it pains me.

310
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,222
It's fine. I'm alive right now
since my surgery went well.

311
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,017
I've been…

312
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,479
praying every day.

313
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,065
I don't even know how to pray,

314
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,650
but I pray with all my heart.

315
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,947
If I think about the donor
and their family,

316
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:51,495
I feel so guilty for feeling so happy
about my daughter living.

317
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,917
Why do you always think
you're a sinner and feel guilty?

318
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,878
Every night,
I feel so uneasy and restless.

319
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,465
I'm worried that you'll suffer again
due to transplant rejection.

320
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,801
Even when I'm praying
about how grateful I am,

321
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,719
my heart sinks worrying about you.

322
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,472
My gosh, it's fine.
You don't have to worry.

323
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,184
I've been diligently taking
my immunosuppressants, okay?

324
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,937
So from now on,

325
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,774
always be healthy,
enjoy and live a happy life.

326
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,403
I want to do that too,
but it's not that easy.

327
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,404
Why?

328
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,825
I don't know what makes me happy.

329
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,828
Happiness isn't rocket science.

330
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,830
Start with something small.

331
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,456
Something you like the best.

332
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,333
What is it that I like?

333
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,461
What did I like to do?

334
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,004
You don't even remember that?

335
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,423
The thing you liked the most was studying.

336
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,300
Studying?

337
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,554
Come on, I'm way too old to study.

338
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,807
I don't know what you should study.

339
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,976
But ever since you were young,

340
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,146
you always liked
studying more than playing.

341
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,064
And you liked learning about things.

342
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,956
RESIDENT
5 YEARS OF MOCK EXAMS

343
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,839
PEDIATRICS MOCK EXAM

344
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,521
I still have it.

345
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,442
"A faithful person will be richly blessed,

346
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:49,779
but one eager to get rich
will not go unpunished."

347
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,822
"Amen."

348
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,284
-Mother, I'll be back home later.
-Jeong-suk.

349
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,995
You look good in those clothes.

350
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,247
I got myself a new outfit.

351
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,916
I see.

352
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,293
You're going out frequently these days.

353
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,545
Can I ask what plans you have tonight?

354
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,548
Yes, of course.
I'm going to drink wine with Mi-hee.

355
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,674
Wine?

356
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,718
-I'll be back later.
-Okay.

357
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,346
Jeong-suk, isn't that my bag?

358
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:15,931
This?

359
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,391
Well, I bought one for myself as well.

360
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,810
Then it's a knock-off?

361
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:26,024
They made it so similar that
you can't tell the difference at a glance.

362
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,235
-Let me see the inside.
-Sure, take a look.

363
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,237
Oh, my. It's exactly the same.

364
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,821
-It's the same as yours, isn't it?
-Yes.

365
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,073
It's because it's real.

366
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,745
Last time, when I went to pick up yours,
the store said they had one more.

367
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,248
It was so pretty that I bought one too.

368
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,417
How could you when it's so expensive?

369
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,837
I know, right? It was really expensive.

370
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,839
But it's really pretty, isn't it?

371
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,092
I'll be back later.

372
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,763
She must've gone crazy.

373
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,973
Lord have mercy.

374
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,101
She's recently had surgery,

375
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,019
-so pour her a little.
-I'll just hold the glass.

376
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,402
It's been so long
since I came to a place like this.

377
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,196
How is it that there are
so many places you haven't been to?

378
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,781
How did I end up like this?

379
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,534
Why are you asking me?
That's the life you chose to live.

380
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:22,247
Right, I brought this unhappiness
upon myself, no one else.

381
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:27,335
If your husband had been your liver donor,
would you still be like this?

382
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,712
No way.

383
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,214
If he had,
I would have been even more grateful

384
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,969
and pushed myself even harder
to become an even better wife.

385
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,012
Isn't it obvious?

386
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,391
Then you should have
just let Seung-hi have In-ho.

387
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,729
Seung-hi? Who's Seung-hi?

388
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,106
How do you not know her?
She's your husband's first love.

389
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,241
You rarely ask us to come to this place.

390
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,076
You don't like eating a lot like this.

391
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,455
It's hard to have
a proper meal these days.

392
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,541
Why? You said your wife
serves you food like a king.

393
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,252
I don't know. Ever since she got sick,

394
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,588
she just hates doing everything.

395
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,757
Here, eat this too.

396
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,802
Seo In-ho and Choi Seung-hi
were a famous couple on campus.

397
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,514
Everyone thought that
they'd get married to each other.

398
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,558
Oh, my.

399
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,894
Gosh, how could I forget that name?

400
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,854
I guess a lot of time has passed.

401
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,647
You have a great memory.

402
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,485
Seung-hi, Mi-hee.
They used to call us the Hi-Hee sisters.

403
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,738
Right.

404
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,492
Even couples who were crazy
about each other at the start

405
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,995
naturally end up living
like strangers as time passes.

406
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,748
But we had an issue from the get-go.

407
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,917
You were an extremely problematic couple.

408
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,671
One day, In-ho up and left Seung-hi
and married you.

409
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,507
On top of that, it was a shotgun marriage.

410
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,511
Exactly when was Jung-min conceived?

411
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,805
-Forget about it.
-It's about time you tell me.

412
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,567
In the second year of pre-med
during winter break,

413
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,321
several classmates got together
and went to Seoraksan.

414
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,785
We said we would just go
until we reached Heundeulbawi,

415
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,539
but I didn't get very far
before I sprained my ankle,

416
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,291
so I went back to where we were staying.

417
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:41,010
But for some reason,
Seo In-ho was the one who took me back.

418
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,140
My goodness.

419
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,059
I didn't expect you this early,
so I had the heater off.

420
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,020
It'll get warm soon.

421
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,439
When we got back to our accommodation,

422
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:57,068
the owner must have
turned the heat all the way up

423
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,903
because it was boiling in there.

424
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,118
In-ho was compressing my ankle,

425
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,037
and his face got so close to mine.

426
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,511
His face was so beautiful.

427
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,017
And he smelled so good too.

428
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,024
Wouldn't it have been the same for him?

429
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,445
Two hotblooded youngsters
in a heated room all by themselves?

430
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:45,658
And Seung-hi was on a trip abroad,
so there was no one there to stop us.

431
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,119
I guess it was just meant to be

432
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,829
because the timing was so perfect.

433
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,632
That's…

434
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,468
when Jung-min was conceived.

435
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,471
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

436
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,655
You bastard.

437
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,491
You horrible bastard.

438
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,452
When you were going to school
with your belly bulging out,

439
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,704
we all felt bad for Seung-hi.

440
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,957
Imagine how absurd
it would've been for her.

441
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,585
Back then, we were all young,
so we all got past it.

442
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,965
But if you think about it now,
isn't Seo In-ho truly a horrible bastard?

443
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,842
He's a complete bastard.

444
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,511
And I'm…

445
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,931
a horrible brat too.

446
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,518
Still, your husband said he would
take responsibility for you and your child

447
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,686
and he married you.

448
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,855
Back then, it seemed admirable.

449
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,107
Your mother-in-law threw a fit back then.

450
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,734
"You two, are you out of your minds?"

451
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:09,117
Hey, I've been subservient my whole life
because of how grateful I was for that.

452
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,247
Flattering my husband, mother-in-law,
and then even the kids later on.

453
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,000
But seeing that none of you ran away

454
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,627
and all three of you graduated
from medical school,

455
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,754
all of you really are something.

456
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,841
Do you know how Seung-hi is doing?

457
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,306
You seem like your mind
is somewhere else lately.

458
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,392
Really? Sorry.

459
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,352
I was all out of sorts.

460
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,689
Is your daughter a sophomore?
Does she want to go to med school?

461
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,650
-Yes.
-She must be smart.

462
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,444
Well, she is.

463
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,072
But at this rate, she might have
to go to a med school outside of Seoul.

464
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,700
She got into art, so she flunked a bit.

465
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,537
You seem indifferent about your kids,
but you are quite devoted.

466
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,749
Why are you saying that?

467
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,709
You know that I'm not a great father.

468
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,837
This may be my guilt talking,
but it sounds like you're blaming me.

469
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,673
The fact I interfered with your life.

470
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,885
-Do you resent me for it?
-I think it was fate.

471
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,264
The fact I met you again at the hospital
in the US where I went for training.

472
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,017
The fact that our connection
has brought us here.

473
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,188
They are some things
that humans cannot control.

474
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,776
I have no idea.

475
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,612
I don't meet
with former classmates that often.

476
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,739
After med school,

477
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,827
Seung-hi cut ties with everyone
while doing her residency in the US.

478
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:38,581
There are rumors
that she had kids and got divorced.

479
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:39,999
I see.

480
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,835
She must be living well.
She's the daughter of a rich family

481
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,672
that runs a clinic franchise
with over ten branches.

482
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,382
She was pretty and had a good body.

483
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,218
Considering her upbringing,
it's easy for her to be rude,

484
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,844
but she had a great personality.

485
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,933
When you put it like that,
I feel even smaller.

486
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:01,729
I already can't control
this empty feeling in my heart.

487
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,399
Why? Do you feel uneasy?

488
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:10,530
There has to be a realistic way
to get rid of this empty feeling.

489
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,323
What is it?

490
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:13,908
Perhaps…

491
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,203
a man?

492
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,274
Are you filming a commercial or something?
The video came out great.

493
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,651
I'm sure it'll blow up
if you upload it on social media.

494
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,504
Man, my foot.

495
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,090
I'm going to ask

496
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,968
to have my name added to the house deed.

497
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,470
That's great!

498
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,431
At our age, I think
that's a reasonable request

499
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,975
between a couple
that's been married for over 20 years!

500
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,728
-Right?
-Go get it, Cha Jeong-suk.

501
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,747
Patient Kim Yeon-suk from ward 151,

502
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,459
please return to the ward.

503
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,763
I have surgery soon, so no tea for me.

504
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,723
What brings you to the hospital?

505
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,852
You look surprised.
It's not like I'm not allowed to be here.

506
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,189
It's just that
you've never visited me here.

507
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,692
I wanted to see Jung-min,
so I thought I'd drop by.

508
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,860
I have something to say too.

509
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,737
What is it? I only have five minutes--

510
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,531
Our house.

511
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,783
I want it to be jointly owned.

512
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,495
Jointly owned? With whom?

513
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,872
Isn't that obvious? Me.

514
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,044
So that's the reason
you came all the way here?

515
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,131
I always wondered,

516
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,551
"Why is my phone
the only thing I have under my name?"

517
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,177
"Are other families like this too?"

518
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,181
I was always so curious
but too embarrassed to ask.

519
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,393
I thought other wives
would treat me like an idiot.

520
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,980
I inherited that house,
so I can't do whatever I want with it.

521
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,149
We'll talk later at home.

522
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,525
I have nothing else to say.

523
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,235
Prepare to answer me when you get home.

524
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,961
What, you crazy bastard?

525
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,635
Who are you to send
a patient home, you idiot!

526
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,597
I mean, I said that
they needed to be tested,

527
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,765
but the patient was adamant
about going home.

528
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,475
Did it make you feel
like you were a real doctor

529
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,060
after the patient said they felt better

530
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,438
just because of
some painkillers you prescribed?

531
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,399
Stop playing doctor at the ER.

532
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,278
That patient should've had an appendectomy
and be in a hospital bed.

533
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,280
But because of you,

534
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,825
they're in excruciating pain
from septic shock from panperitonitis.

535
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,951
Do you understand?

536
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,624
What are you doing?
Hurry up and contact that patient.

537
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,181
She's literally crushing him.

538
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,560
She even looks mean.

539
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,191
Doctor.

540
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,029
Doctor.

541
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,699
Oh, my. Professor.

542
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,665
-But did you just call me "doctor"?
-Yes.

543
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,876
It's been so long
since someone called me that,

544
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,796
so it didn't cross my mind
you'd be referring to me.

545
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,925
But it's nice to be called a doctor.

546
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,719
It's nothing, but you seem
to be enjoying it a lot.

547
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,637
Doctor.

548
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,390
Give me your number.

549
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,649
I feel like you misconstrue things often.

550
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:01,445
That's not it. It's just that you asked
for my number so suddenly.

551
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,030
I'm sorry.

552
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,367
The pictures of you.
I thought I should send them to you.

553
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,994
Right.

554
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,580
You're right. There's no need for you
to hold onto photos of me.

555
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,375
Here you go.

556
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,754
I sent them.

557
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,672
Okay.

558
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,471
You can delete them now.

559
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,474
What brings you here though?

560
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,560
Someone asked to see me.

561
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,687
What about you?

562
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,315
I came to meet my son and husband.

563
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,692
You said they were both doctors, right?

564
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,111
So they work here.

565
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,197
Do you feel all right?

566
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,493
Yes, you performed the surgery so well.

567
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,288
I wasn't able to properly thank you.

568
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,251
I guess being sick made me
forget my manners.

569
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,253
Thank you so much, Dr. Kim.

570
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:06,135
To a doctor, there's no better thank you
than if a patient becomes healthy again.

571
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,557
I had forgotten for a long time,
but being a doctor…

572
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,310
is such a good profession.

573
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,563
You heal the sick.

574
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,153
Do you have plans to work again?

575
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,030
What?

576
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,992
That'd be a disservice to the patients.

577
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,119
You saw what happened last time.

578
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,245
That's not true.

579
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,751
I think you would do a good job.

580
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:42,963
Me?

581
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,664
THE 48TH CLASS OF GUSAN UNIVERSITY

582
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,436
Joint ownership?

583
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,771
Yes, I thought that
I should consult with you.

584
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,567
Of course, you should consult me!

585
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,569
I'm the one who persuaded your father

586
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,779
-to switch the deed to your name early.
-Right.

587
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,616
Did the big surgery
mess with her head or something?

588
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,826
I was surprised too--

589
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,327
Don't even listen to her.

590
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,579
She'll hear you.

591
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,122
That's the point!

592
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,540
How dare she demand this?

593
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,584
She must've gone crazy
after that sickness.

594
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,835
Look at her going on a power trip!

595
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,795
-Stop going on a power trip!
-Come on.

596
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,422
Let go.

597
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,715
My back hurts.

598
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,844
I thought I had it under control.

599
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,683
RESIDENT
DR. CHA JEONG-SUK

600
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,168
Do you have plans to work again?

601
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,559
Come here for a moment.

602
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,688
CHA JEONG-SUK

603
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,232
What is it?

604
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,610
About the joint ownership,
I consulted my mother--

605
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,365
I consulted her, and…

606
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,659
I think it'll be hard.

607
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,285
She doesn't want to do it?

608
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,954
It's under your name.

609
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,247
She's from an older generation,

610
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,791
so she may not be able to understand.

611
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,377
I hope you can understand this time.

612
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,881
Was there ever a time
when I didn't understand?

613
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,633
Don't go all negative about this.

614
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,511
You seem to be having fun lately
even without this.

615
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,347
Honey.

616
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,350
What if…

617
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,853
I applied for residency?

618
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,275
-What?
-Because of Jung-min's accident,

619
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,193
I gave up on the residency.

620
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,656
Lately, I have a lot of regrets
about what I gave up back then.

621
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,494
I was thinking of starting my practice…

622
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,746
again.

623
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,709
Applying for residency? Why now?

624
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,795
Seriously, stop making me laugh.

625
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,927
If you want to work,
go to work for a local clinic.

626
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,056
I have to have experience
to work at a clinic too.

627
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,268
I haven't practiced in 20 years,
so how can I suddenly treat patients?

628
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,688
It might be hard,
but going through my residency--

629
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,732
You'll be 50 by the time you finish.

630
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,484
The average life expectancy is longer now,
so that's still young.

631
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,903
Who would welcome
an old and sick resident?

632
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,364
Don't be a nuisance and just drop it.

633
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,366
If you keep being like this,

634
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,620
I'm going to apply to your hospital
and your department.

635
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,080
I'm the chief of my department.
I won't pick you.

636
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,000
When we were in school,
my grades were much better than yours.

637
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,835
I took the lead after pre-med.

638
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,212
That's because I had a baby then!

639
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,798
If you had helped me out with the baby,

640
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,383
my grades wouldn't have dropped.

641
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,011
If that's what you want to do,
then give it a shot.

642
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:02,181
It's pretty obvious what your score
will be if you take the test now.

643
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,683
Once you fail,
you'll finally get a reality check.

644
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,228
If I pass, what will you do then?

645
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:13,859
Just go to sleep.

646
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,457
Bonjour.

647
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,128
This place makes proper French cuisine.

648
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,214
It's a Michelin two-star.

649
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,341
It's hard to get a reservation here,

650
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,511
but I asked a friend to pull some strings
so I could come here with you.

651
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,096
I see.

652
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,514
There's no mother-in-law like me,
is there?

653
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,307
Yes.

654
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,602
A mother-in-law like you is rare.

655
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,189
Eat up. I'm not sure
if it'll suit your palate though.

656
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:53,816
Okay.

657
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,696
I'm sure you already heard it from In-ho,

658
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:05,661
but I thought it would be better
to hear it from me directly and honestly.

659
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:11,959
In-ho wanted to add your name
to the house deed,

660
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,002
but I told him he can't.

661
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,463
Your father-in-law plugged away

662
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,882
at his hospital to buy that house.

663
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,593
Though sons and daughters
are treated the same now,

664
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,429
things are different
in a prestigious family like ours.

665
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,808
Assets should be passed down
from a son to their son.

666
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,727
In the end, all the family assets
will be passed down to Jung-min.

667
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,772
As his mother, there's no need
to touch your son's assets, right?

668
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,359
Don't take what I said to heart.

669
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,779
And don't give your husband
a hard time about this either, okay?

670
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,364
Okay.

671
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,999
You should use this car.

672
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,668
I thought about getting you a new one,

673
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,712
but it's only been a year
since I bought it,

674
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,755
so it's as good as new.

675
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,220
It's okay, Mother.

676
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,891
I understand what you're saying.

677
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,018
All right.

678
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,395
You're a smart girl.

679
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,154
Shall we have some wine?

680
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:23,822
Okay.

What?

684
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,946
Jeez.

685
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,452
Goodness.

686
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,425
Wait. I'm getting off too. I'm sorry!

687
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,844
Jeez, it's cold.

00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:31,927
for the 2022 resident assessment
examination is 49.

693
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,596
2022 RESIDENT ASSESSMENT EXAMINATION
49 OUT OF 50

694
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,773
JUNG-MIN, YOUR RESIDENCY EXAM
SCORE IS OUT, RIGHT?

695
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,191
HOW DID YOU DO?

696
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:58,203
MY SON: I SCORED 45

697
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:03,667
THAT'S A GREAT SCORE AS AN INTERN
CONGRATULATIONS!

698
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,105
It's a fresh, good look on you.

699
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,066
Great.

700
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,529
That's great. One more time.

701
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,824
RESIDENCY APPLICATION

702
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,040
NAME: CHA JEONG-SUK

703
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,211
DEPARTMENT

704
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,423
Female, 36 years old.

705
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,177
We suspect she has multiple fractures in
her abdomen and pelvis from a car crash.

706
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,554
She went into cardiac arrest,
so we've been performing CPR.

707
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,431
For how long? Is everything else okay?

708
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,932
We've been performing it for ten minutes.

709
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,684
Transfer her quickly.
Someone hold her bag valve mask

710
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,394
and someone keep performing CPR.

711
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,730
What are you doing? Switch with him!

712
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,190
Have you never performed CPR?

713
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,858
-I'll do it!
-Let's go.

714
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,570
DEPARTMENT: SURGERY

715
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,324
No.

716
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,160
Being a surgeon at my age
would be pushing it.

717
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,330
Hi, Ye-bin.

718
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,291
I have to take some blood samples.
There you go.

719
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,751
Doctor.

720
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,960
Yes?

721
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,047
How long can I live?

722
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,931
Even the thought of it is heartbreaking.

723
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,938
I don't think I can treat sick kids.

724
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,073
What should I do?

725
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,244
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

726
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,664
There are resident interviews today,
and I was looking through them

727
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,041
when I came across
a fascinating candidate.

728
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,918
She's older than me.

729
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,461
She always got good grades.

730
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,755
She scored high
on the medical licensing exam.

731
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,132
And she scored 49 on the resident exams.

732
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,845
I wonder why such a smart person
didn't practice for so long.

733
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,764
What's the point? She'll be 50 soon.

734
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,850
How many applicants do we have this time?

735
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,852
There are three spots and four applicants.

736
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,813
Then it's decided. She's out.

737
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,399
Dr. Choi, wasn't she a classmate
of yours in med school?

738
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,484
You seem like you're similar in age.

739
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,738
Yes. But it's been so long
that my memory is kind of fuzzy.

740
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,826
But it says right here
that she received a liver transplant.

741
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,412
What? Liver transplant.

742
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,539
Goodness.

743
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,124
Then she's 200% out.

744
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,173
-Hey.
-What's the deal with your wife?

745
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,509
-What do you mean?
-She applied--

746
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,387
She applied to our hospital
in my department.

747
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,555
Did you already know?

748
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,515
Really?

749
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,643
One of the professors doing the interviews
showed me her application.

750
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,896
She definitely applied.

751
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,064
Cha Jeong-suk, Gusan University
School of Medicine, freshman in 1995.

752
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,942
She scored 49 on the resident exams.

753
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,695
Hello? Say something.

754
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,616
She scored 49?
That woman has completely lost her mind!

755
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,453
Sorry. Hang up for a minute.

756
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,926
JUNG-MIN'S DAD

757
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,392
-Your call cannot be…
-Damn it.

758
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,977
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

759
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,080
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

760
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,009
2022 RESIDENCY INTERVIEWS

761
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,054
I'll be there soon.

762
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,598
Okay, please just check for now.

763
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,529
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

764
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,330
-Kim U-ju.
-Yes.

765
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,583
Mom?

766
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,556
Mom.

767
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,809
You can't just come here.

768
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,311
It's fine.

769
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:16,813
INTERVIEW IDENTIFICATION TAG

770
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,066
I'm here for an interview too.

771
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,319
-What?
-Let's talk later.

772
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,114
You've got this!

773
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,843
How is your health right now?

774
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,970
As I wrote in my application,

775
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,849
I received a liver transplant,
and I am healthy now.

776
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,144
You may not have any difficulty
in your everyday life.

777
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,606
However, the training process demands

778
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,150
a lot of mental
and physical energy, does it not?

779
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,070
You must be taking
immunosuppressants right now too.

780
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,156
-Yes.
-What if you get infected in the hospital?

781
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,408
Nothing's more important than your life.

782
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,119
That's enough.
She must know that the best.

783
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,081
Also, you are not young.

784
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,041
To be exact, you're a bit old.

785
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,502
I mean, you're very old.

786
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,379
-Are you 45?
-I'm 46.

787
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,090
To be honest, given your age,

788
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,468
it won't be easy to maintain
a good relationship with your colleagues.

789
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,803
To be even more honest,

790
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,181
you already know
that others will dislike you.

791
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,245
Yes, hello?

792
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:58,414
Yes, this is Cha Jeong-suk.

793
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,336
Excuse me.

794
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,839
If you don't mind,

795
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:10,552
could I know the reason I was rejected?

796
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:14,055
Was it because of my age?

797
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,851
Yes, okay.

798
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,234
So what did they say?

799
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,695
They told me to look for other hospitals
before it's too late.

800
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,738
Then you should apply
to a smaller hospital.

801
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,867
You can just go somewhere else.
Why are you so down?

802
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,829
Failure is always painful.

803
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,250
-Welcome.
-Hello.

804
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:43,960
What happened to your face?

805
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,754
What about it?

806
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,506
You don't look well.

807
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,507
Really?

808
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,260
I feel fine.

809
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,428
Then that's a relief.

810
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:58,016
Right, why don't you go on a vacation?

811
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,269
You're probably mentally
exhausted after the surgery.

812
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,189
Don't you think it'd be good for you
to go somewhere nice?

813
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,182
She got rejected.

814
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,810
What a relief. Congratulations.

815
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:16,761
Even though test methods have advanced,
you can't miss that point.

816
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,263
-Yes.
-Yes, okay.

817
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,764
Yes, okay.

818
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,664
DOCTOR CHA

819
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,688
Being sorry won't solve this issue.
What will you do now?

820
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,315
We'll have to make her quit.

821
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,692
Honey, can you drop me off?

822
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,776
No, I can't.

823
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,363
How can you decide on a treatment plan
for a patient when you know so little?

824
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,782
You can't even pretend
to be a doctor at this rate.

825
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,993
No one knows about me and her.

826
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,995
-And we don't want people to know.
-Why not?

827
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:27,832
The people at the hospital don't know
that they're my son and husband.

828
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,835
I know, but when are you going
to get a divorce?

829
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:37,675
