00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,345
To be honest, given your age,

3
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,722
it won't be easy to maintain

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,974
a good relationship with your colleagues.

5
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,309
To be even more honest,

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,771
you already know
that others will dislike you.

7
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,904
I am ashamed to admit that,

8
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,948
even after the day I started
and graduated from medical school,

9
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,118
and after completing my internship,
I had never thought of

10
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,871
what kind of doctor I wanted to be.

11
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,207
I went to med school
because I had good grades.

12
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,042
All I wanted to do was become a doctor

13
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,044
and a proud daughter

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,255
who would build up our family's fortune.

15
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,174
As funny as it may sound,

16
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,635
only after raising two children

17
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,512
as a housewife for 20 years

18
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,640
and experiencing
a major liver transplant surgery

19
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,519
did I finally begin to harbor a desire
to become a really good doctor.

20
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,354
I am also confident

21
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,690
that such experiences will provide
a great foundation as a doctor.

22
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,276
However, all of my hopes can come true

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,571
only after I pass this interview.

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,115
All right.

25
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,574
You may leave.

26
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:57,992
Thank you.

2022 RESIDENCY INTERVIEWS

28
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,798
I commend her courage.

29
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,424
And she seems like a good doctor.

30
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,717
What does the FM Department think?

31
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,802
Do you feel skeptical?

32
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,346
Try to put yourself in our shoes.

33
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,806
Would you choose her?

34
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,933
Maybe, maybe not.

35
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,312
Please go inside.

36
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,606
Jung-min, how did your interview go?

37

2022 GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
RESIDENCY INTERVIEWS

38
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,367
Does Father know?

39
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,326
No.

40
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,537
If he knew, would he have let me come?

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,248
Mom, you can't be a resident.

42
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,583
Listen to yourself.

43
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,710
I'll have you know
I'm a med school graduate.

44
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,382
You might have forgotten this
because I'm always at home,

45
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,634
but I had pretty good grades
back in school.

46
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,221
I scored 49 on the resident exams.

47
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,639
You scored 49?

48
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,977
I only scored 45.

49
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,353
Hey.

50
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,731
You studied during your internship,

51
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,274
but I went all in.

52
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,817
Right.

53
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,153
So?

54
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,738
You're going to work here if you get in?

55
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,698
What about Father?

56
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,992
I'll start working first.

57
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,785
Well.

58
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,580
If he finds out, I'll deal with it then.

59
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,208
Mom, how can you be so reckless?

60
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,210
Father isn't the main issue.

61
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,212
What if you catch an infection here?

62
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,091
You just got out of surgery.

63
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,427
How are you
going to manage this tough job?

64
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,891
Jung-min.

65
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,229
Please worry about me
after I pass the interview.

66
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,813
Okay?

67
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,941
I appreciate your concern.

68
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,861
Did you get the day off
for your interview??

69
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,448
There's a place I have to stop by.

70
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,369
Keep your chin up!

71
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,081
Did you meet your wife?

72
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,796
Come in.

73
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,177
It is you.

74
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,850
Do you remember me?

75
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,062
I was a Gusan University
School of Medicine freshman in '95,

76
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,563
Cha Jeong-suk.

77
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,275
I do remember.

78
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,318
Have a seat.

79
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,951
I'm so relieved.

80
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,661
I thought you wouldn't remember me.

81
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,289
It's been so long.

82
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,543
It's been over 20 years,
but you haven't aged a day.

83
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,212
That's not true.

84
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,590
I'm sorry for barging in like this.

85
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,592
I wasn't sure if you heard,

86
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,387
but I applied to be a resident
of Family Medicine.

87
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,516
I saw you on the website
before I turned in my application.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,227
-I see.
-I'm not sure

89
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,147
if I'll get hired or not at this point.

90
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,607
But if I do get hired,

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,568
I'll do my best.

92
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,904
I'll do my best not to make
the other residents uncomfortable,

93
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,197
so please help me out.

94
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,994
I'm not sure if that can happen
just by your effort alone.

95
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,499
Right.

96
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,126
Anyway, it was nice to see you.

97
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,210
I hope you make it.

98
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,963
Yes, thank you.

99
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,591
By the way,

100
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,260
does your husband know

101
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,512
that you applied here?

102
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,389
Right.

103
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,266
About thatâ€¦

104
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,645
can you keep it a secret

105
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,981
if you run into him?

106
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,360
Why? A married couple will be
working at the same hospital.

107
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,320
Shouldn't he know?

108
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,113
My husband

109
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,950
also didn't tell me you worked here.

110
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,644
I don't think they'll hire her.

111
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,854
Does it seem so?

112
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,064
Of course.

113
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,565
Why would anyone choose

114
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,692
an older applicant
over young, spirited ones?

115
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,986
On top of that, she's not in good health.

116
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,989
I was wondering because she had
high scores on her resident exams.

117
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,158
Where were you
while she was doing all this?

118
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,410
You should've stopped her
before things came to this point.

119
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,870
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,372
She wanted to be a resident,

121
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,707
but I didn't think she would
actually take the exam.

122
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,502
On top of that,
who knew she'd apply to this hospital?

123
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,174
I'm taking two days off next week.

124
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,344
I have to go see my father on Jeju Island.

125
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,679
Your father?

126
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,849
-He called?
-Yes.

127
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,811
He was diagnosed
with stage four pancreatic cancer.

128
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,563
Goodness.

129
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,065
I guess it finally made him think of
the daughter he abandoned.

130
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,943
It's all my fault.

131
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,417
Yes, hello?

132
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,628
Yes, this is Cha Jeong-suk.

133
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,925
Excuse me.

134
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,344
If you don't mind,

135
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:55,183
could I know the reason I was rejected?

136
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,267
Was it

137
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,728
because of my age?

138
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,064
Yes, okay.

139
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,239
So what did they say?

140
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,326
They told me to look for other hospitals
before it's too late.

141
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,369
Then you should apply
to a smaller hospital.

142
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,498
You can just go somewhere else.
Why are you so down?

143
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,043
Failure is always painful.

144
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,671
Welcome.

145
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,881
Hello.

146
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,591
What happened to your face?

147
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,969
What about it?

148
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,137
You don't look well.

149
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,347
Really?

150
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,891
I feel fine.

151
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,059
Then that's a relief.

152
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,647
Right, why don't you go on a vacation?

153
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,399
You're probably mentally
exhausted after the surgery.

154
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,819
Don't you think it'd be good for you
to go somewhere nice?

155
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,215
PASSENGER TERMINAL
THIS WAY

156
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:58,097
I have no idea
why I am going on a trip right now.

157
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,558
You know what they say.

158
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,396
When humans face a crisis in life,
they must leave for somewhere.

159
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:10,901
It's human nature to discover
a breakthrough in life by leaving.

160
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,405
The breakthrough in my life wasâ€¦

161
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,243
supposed to be
starting a new life as a doctor,

162
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,954
not a trip to Boracay.

163
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,748
Unbelievable.

164
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,334
Your last trip abroad was ages ago.

165
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,835
Can you be a bit cheerful?

166
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,253
At any rate,

167
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,506
you have a knack
for making your own life troublesome.

168
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,801
I'm just disappointed, that's all.

169
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,136
That's enough.

170
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,721
So what about my age?

171
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,598
Are older people not allowed
to have dreams?

172
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,725
I'm not asking for much.

173
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,729
You'll get wrinkles
if you keep stressing out like that.

174
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,815
Here. Make sure to apply this every day.

175
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,610
I know what this is.

176
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,904
You use it like this, right?

177
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,322
Yes.

178
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,573
Good, that's it.

179
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,825
Your neck too.

180
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,786
Good.

181
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,412
Much better.

182
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,914
-Really?
-Yes.

183
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,751
If that hospital doesn't hire you,
you can find another one.

184
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,169
You applied, right?

185
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,714
Yes, I have another interview next week.

186
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,094
Family medicine is a department
with a humane touch,

187
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,098
so I'm sure there's a hospital somewhere
willing to take you.

188
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,849
Don't obsess over
Gusan University Hospital.

189
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,892
Why there of all places?

190
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,894
Your husband works there.
It'll be uncomfortable.

191
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,064
Choi Seung-hi.

192
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,233
Choi Seung-hi?

193
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,902
Your husband's first love?
That Choi Seung-hi?

194
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,195
Yes.

195
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,656
That Choi Seung-hiâ€¦

196
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,368
works at Gusan University Hospital.

197
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,830
-What?
-She's a professor

198
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,331
of family medicine there.

199
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,252
He's not going to come? Why not?

200
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,463
His girlfriend dumped him,
so he enlisted in the army in shock.

201
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,549
What kind of an idiot is that?

202
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,008
What should we do, Professor?

203
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,136
Then we only have that old applicant left?

204
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,388
-Yes.
-Good grief.

205
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,431
Should I call her?

206
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,765
I don't know. Do what you will.

207
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,938
Really?

208
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,150
Wait, so did you run into her
at the interview?

209
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,277
No, I didn't see her at the interview.

210
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,071
I already knew before I went.

211
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,990
You may say that I'm silly,

212
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,616
but oddlyâ€¦

213
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,910
it felt offensive.

214
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,955
I would call you crazy
if you were happy to see her.

215
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,499
Your husband hid the fact that
he worked in the same place

216
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,502
as his first love,
whom he was madly in love with.

217
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,503
How can you feel--

218
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,173
I see.

219
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,969
Is that why you insisted on
working at Gusan University Hospital?

220
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,637
To keep an eye on them?

221
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,557
No! Come on!

222
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,519
It's my alma mater too.

223
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,147
It's a great hospital,
so I thought I'd learn more

224
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,149
if I worked as a resident there.

225
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,693
That's why I want to go there. As if!

226
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,863
I'm too old to do something that immature.

227
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,407
You also know what you said

228
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,784
is a lousy excuse, right?

229
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:18,881
All right.

230
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,927
Who is this?

231
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,803
Hello?

232
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,390
Yes, I'm Cha Jeong-suk.

233
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,187
Gusan University Hospital?

234
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,317
Yes.

235
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,654
Okay.

236
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,118
What is it? What did the hospital say?

237
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,204
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,665
I can't go on this trip.

239
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,083
They want you?

240
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,961
They want me.

241
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,927
Get over here!

242
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,015
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

243
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,479
-Hello.
-Hello.

244
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,441
-Hello, Professor!
-Hello, Professor.

245
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,694
I'm not a professor.

246
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,657
I'm a resident here.

247
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,207
-Hello.
-Hello.

248
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,835
Hello.

249
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,878
-Hello.
-Hello.

250
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,005
My name is Lee Do-gyeom.

251
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,049
I'm Moon Chea-yoon. I was born in 1995.

252
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,551
My name is Cha Jeong-suk.

253
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,927
I'm also a 1995â€¦

254
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,180
A freshman in 1995.

255
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,936
I'll do my best not to be a nuisance
to my seniors and juniors.

256
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,897
I hope you don't feel awkward

257
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,566
and treat me as you would
any other resident.

258
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,650
Of course we will.

259
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,863
I hate those who want special treatment
just because they're older.

260
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,365
Of course, I totally understand.

261
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,330
We work almost 80 hours a week.

262
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,664
Is that all right?

263
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,668
Our shifts are that short these days?

264
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,256
Gosh, back in my day,
we'd work 100 hours a week,

265
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,966
then do night shifts for two weeks,

266
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,967
and first-yearâ€¦

267
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,471
You know, where you get banned
from going out for 100 days.

268
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,472
-The 100-day shifts.
-The 100-day shifts.

269
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,767
Yes, the 100-night shifts.
We had those traditions.

270
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,851
Those are longâ€¦

271
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,894
Long gone.

272
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,520
Long gone, right?

273
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,817
That was a vibe killer.

274
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,322
People would use "vibe killer"
for situations like this, right?

275
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,865
Yes, it was a vibe killer.

276
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,660
Or would you say "that was cringe"?

277
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,173
Professor Choi, you must not have known
because you were taking days off.

278
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,051
After twists and turns,
she joined our department.

279
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,095
This is Dr. Cha Jeong-suk. Please say hi.

280
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,514
Hello, Professor.

281
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,739
Even though test methods have advanced,
you can't miss that point.

282
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,074
-Yes.
-Yes, okay.

283
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,450
Yes, okay.

284
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,887
BOOK CAFE LOUNGE

285
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,531
Excuse me.

286
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,617
I'm not feeling well. I need an IV drip.

287
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,702
An IV drip?

288
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,996
Have you made your payment?

289
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,665
-Payment?
-Please come back

290
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,418
after taking a number ticket
at the registration and making a payment.

291
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,587
It's not that. It's an emergency.

292
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,588
Don't you know me?

293
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,673
Professor Seo, why are you here?

294
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,008
Ms. Lee.

295
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,928
I'm in bad condition right now,
so I'd like an IV drip.

296
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,931
But she just told me
to go make the payment first.

297
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,976
It's her first day,
so she has no idea what's going on.

298
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,103
I'll give you the IV drip.

299
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,521
-This way, please.
-Thank you.

300
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,232
Goodness, what happened?

301
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,445
This is what it feels likeâ€¦

302
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,074
to lose years off of my life.

303
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,207
SEUNG-HI:
I NEED TO SEE YOU NOW

304
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,043
Jeez.

305
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,008
I couldn't believe it
even after you texted me.

306
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,926
I was shocked,

307
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,261
as if I was struck by lightning--

308
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,429
More shocked than me?

309
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,056
Were you more stunned than me?

310
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,518
I came to work in the morning
and saw your wife right in front of me.

311
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,061
I almost fainted.

312
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,229
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,064
Being sorry won't solve this issue.

314
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,941
How are you treated at home?

315
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,360
What does your wife take you for?

316
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,113
How could she make such a big decision
without asking you even once?

317
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,447
That's what I'm saying!

318
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,867
What will you do now?

319
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,703
How will you deal with this mess?

320
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,540
Should I go to a new hospital?
Should I resign?

321
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,627
Seung-hi, let's not get worked up.
We need to calm down.

322
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,295
Give me some time to think.

323
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,755
I can't wait long.

334
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,727
Come in.

335
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,730
Hello.

336
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,232
Hello.

337
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,276
-Ms. Cha's--
-Goodness.

338
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,988
I stopped by to greet
the new doctor who will be working here.

339
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,615
I see you're here too, Chief.

340
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,909
I believe this is
the first time we've met.

341
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,787
My name is Seo In-ho.

342
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,501
How do you do?

343
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,461
I'm Roy Kimberley.

344
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,379
Please call me Roy.

345
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,299
Yes.

346
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,260
Please have a seat.

347
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,388
I was just on my way out.
You two should have a chat.

348
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,891
It's reassuring to have
two great doctors here,

349
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:26,850
with a dragon on my right,

350
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,852
and a tiger on my left.

351
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,689
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

352
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,371
How did you end up coming here?

353
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,457
Did you sleep well?

354
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,084
How's your stomachache?

355
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,002
My stomachache is fine,

356
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,754
but what's in this IV drip?

357
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,047
It better not be glucose.

358
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,300
It's only made of healthy protein
to increase your muscle mass.

359
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,553
And we'd like to refer you
to our Psychiatry Department

360
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,681
for a counseling session.

361
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,682
How does that sound?

362
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,351
The Psychiatry Department?
Why should I go there?

363
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,605
Just consider it an opportunity
to share your worries and thoughts.

364
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,524
That way, you can be discharged sooner.

365
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,026
Fine.

366
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,861
Refer her to Psychiatry,

367
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,155
and get another reading for her AP CT.

368
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,700
Also contact Surgery to see
if she can get surgery

369
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,827
if her abdominal pain continues.

370
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,206
Excuse me, could you say that again? APâ€¦

371
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,167
AP CT.

372
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,920
Abdomen and pelvis CT.

373
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,672
Yes.

374
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:58,817
So can you scare my wife
and make her give up on her residency?

375
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,985
There are many excuses.

376
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,903
Infections, relapses, et cetera.

377
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,824
People may not listen
to those who are close to them,

378
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,368
but they tend to listen
to someone who is not as close.

379
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,456
But I'm not sure.

380
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,583
It will be difficult,

381
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,171
but I personally wish
to show support for her choice.

382
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,466
It sounds like she found her spirit.

383
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,347
Are you saying
you'll just stand by and watch

384
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,016
as a patient whom you operated on
endangers her life?

385
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,476
"Stand by and watch"?

386
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,812
I'll check her condition
every now and then.

387
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,485
Yes, in that case,

388
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,070
I understand.

389
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,739
I have one more favor to ask.

390
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,949
I'll be honest,

391
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,036
while my relationship with my son is
known at work,

392
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,705
no one knows about me and her.

393
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,332
And we don't want people to know.

394
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,209
Why not?

395
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,215
"Why not?" You're pissing me off
with every word.

396
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:09,179
She can easily become a target of hatred
given her circumstances,

397
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,598
so if people find out she's my wife,

398
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,601
her peers will find her
even more uncomfortable.

399
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,770
But if people find out she's your wife,

400
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,814
they won't bully her.

401
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,983
She's the one who'll want this the most.

402
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,863
I understand.

403
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,616
It's wonderful to see

404
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,535
a family of doctors.

405
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,286
Yes, sure.

406
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,247
My father was a surgeon too.

407
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,040
He was a pioneer in the field

408
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,668
who first introduced
laparoscopic surgery in Korea.

409
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,836
I see.

410
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,631
It's not rare to have three generations
of doctors in one family.

411
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,885
If I may, what does your father do?

412
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,513
In Korea,

413
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,474
isn't asking about
someone's dad's job considered

414
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,476
old-fashioned?

415
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:57,978
Sorry?

416
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,359
I was joking. A joke.

417
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,195
You littleâ€¦

418
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,031
My father is
in the real estate business in New York.

419
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,535
He also invests
in promising companies and hotels.

420
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,875
I see.

421
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,001
Yes.

422
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,056
PATIENT: OH CHANG-GYU

423
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,777
Hello.

424
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,697
I came to brief you
on the exams you'll take today

425
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,240
and have your consent forms signed.

426
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,243
It does make it feel
like my money was well spent,

427
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,370
given that they assigned a professor
to brief me directly.

428
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,581
I'm not a professor.

429
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,083
I'm a first-year resident.

430
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,710
Then why are you so old?

431
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,170
Right.

432
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,049
I took a long time off
after graduating from medical school.

433
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,301
What's the point
of hearing a rookie brief me?

434
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,302
Darn it.

435
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,144
You're about to receive
a gastroscopy and enteroscopy.

436
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,522
If polyps are found
during the examination,

437
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,777
they can progress into cancer,
so we plan on removing those.

438
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,863
And right here.
As it is with all procedures,

439
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,575
there is a possibility
of bleeding, infection,

440
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,786
and other complications
during the endoscopy.

441
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,456
Also, if you are allergic
to the anesthetic used,

442
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:46,002
there's a small chance of going
into shock or losing consciousness.

443
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,797
Mr. Oh, did you fast?

444
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,594
He goes by "Chairman Oh," actually.

445
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:00,058
Goodness, I apologize for my mistake.

446
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,603
Chairman Oh, have you fasted
since midnight?

447
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,729
I have.

448
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,275
I UNDERSTAND AND PERMIT
THE ABOVE PROCEDURE

449
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,613
So does endoscopy hurt a lot?

450
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,031
Usually,

451
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,741
yes.

452
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,369
But in your case, mister,
you'll be sedated,

453
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,162
so you won't feel any pain.

454
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,665
But once you wake up,

455
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,002
you may feel some discomfort inside.

456
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,379
-Hey.
-Yes, Chairman Oh?

457
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,716
Nothing.

458
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,384
In that case,

459
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,137
I'll escort you
to the endoscopy room in 30 minutes.

460
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,724
Please have a great examination,
Chairman Oh.

461
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,316
Good grief.

462
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,067
Is he here?

463
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,446
He's so handsome. My gosh.

464
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,990
-I'm sorry.
-Not at all.

465
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,700
Look at him. He's so handsome.

466
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,784
Hello.

467
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,466
He's really good-looking.

468
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,051
-He's so dreamy!
-He is!

469
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:16,968
Look at him.

470
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,065
Chief, I'm the advisor.

471
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,317
How could you hire her
without notifying me?

472
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,403
As you know, the law has changed.

473
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,613
We'll face problems

474
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,282
if we do not accept all applicants
if we have an opening.

475
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,701
I couldn't drag back that kid
who went to the army,

476
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,537
and I couldn't steal applicants
from another hospital.

477
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,540
But still, how can you accept a resident
who'll be 50 soon?

478
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,125
Don't be so harsh.

479
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,752
We're all growing old.

480
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,170
We're allâ€¦

481
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:54,798
Chief Lim!

482
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,301
What is it?

483
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,512
Well, there's a problem.

484
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,389
What now?

485
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,141
Why are we facing so many problems lately?

486
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,810
It's second-year resident,
Dr. Baek I-yeon,

487
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,686
-who went to work with Surgery.
-Yes.

488
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,563
She's pregnant.

489
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,690
Good for her. Wait.

490
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,610
-And?
-She's quitting.

491
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,071
She says the hospital
isn't good for her baby.

492
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,324
Goodness gracious.

493
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,868
Everyone is quitting
over the army and babies.

494
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,955
We're facing so much trouble from day one.

495
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,875
Chief Lim.

496
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,088
CHA JEONG-SUK

497
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,970
She's the replacement
for the second-year who quit.

498
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,807
The Family Medicine Department
also said that they are very sorry.

499
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,809
I see.

500
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,644
Wellâ€¦

501
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,481
We're fine.

502
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,067
-Right?
-Sorry?

503
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,613
Yes, right.

504
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,620
But our department can
always use another hand.

505
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,164
I'll keep her under control.

506
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,418
Nice to meet you, Professor.

507
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:14,878
Hello.

508
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,593
Sure.

509
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,472
Then let's go that way.

510
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,079
Does that feel all right?

511
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,255
-That hurts.
-I haven't touched the wound yet.

512
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,381
Be gentle, will you?

513
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,300
Yes.

514
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,386
Wait, let's begin on the count of three.

515
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,679
One.

516
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,181
Two.

517
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,390
Three.

518
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,538
Please get

519
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,915
epinephrine and tubes ready,

520
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,501
-then page the surgeon on duty.
-Okay.

521
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,878
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

522
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,054
That hurts. What are you doing?

523
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,764
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

524
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,015
What are you doing?

525
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,141
Can't you tell?

526
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,810
I'm working.

527
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,188
How can you do this without telling me?
You came to my department out of--

528
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,566
Even if I talked to you,
you would've stopped me.

529
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,110
Exactly, why did you do such a thing
if you knew that would happen?

530
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,156
I mean, do you have to do this residency?

531
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,534
You can always live a new life

532
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:13,037
depending on what you make of it
as a faithful housewife.

533
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,539
Einstein said,

534
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,417
â€œThe definition of insanity
is doing the same thing over and over

535
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,252
and expecting different results."

536
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,170
Are you calling me insane?

537
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,756
You're so ignorant.

538
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,842
Can't you read between the lines?

539
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,096
I'm saying I'm making an effort
to build a different future.

540
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,807
I'm sorry, but I'm busy.

541
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,854
And what if someone sees us?

542
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,899
Are you okay with everyone finding out
that I'm your wife?

543
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,871
You scared me.

544
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,375
I feel like
I'm seeing things at the hospital.

545
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,794
You should get used to that feeling.

546
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:07,133
What is this?
You need to eat a balanced meal.

547
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,094
Excuse me, you cannot do this here.

548
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,180
We aren't at home.

549
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,140
Yes, Dr. Seo.

550
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,267
May I eat with you?

551
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,435
No.

552
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,147
Ignoring everything else,

553
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,483
what if you collapse at work?

554
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,443
It's wearying even for me.

555
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,696
You may have physical strength,
but I have a strong mentality.

556
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,990
No matter how determined you are,

557
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,492
your body is at work.

558
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,244
-If you have a weak body--
-Jung-min.

559
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,955
Listen carefully.

560
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,333
I'm stronger
than I've ever been in my life.

561
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,752
Don't worry.

562
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,756
Eat up.

563
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,551
The bean sprouts are good.

564
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,266
It's not that I'm opposed to your dream.

565
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,185
I was just worried about you.

566
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,437
You can call me
any time you're in trouble.

567
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,940
MY SON

568
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,942
Thank you, Jung-min.

569
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,360
I love you!

570
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,287
We finally met.

571
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,331
Goodness, Professor.

572
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,001
Why are you here?

573
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,045
Today was also my first day
at this hospital.

574
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,468
Come to think of it,

575
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,014
I need to ask you for a favor.

576
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,934
The people at the hospital don't know

577
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,520
that they're my son and husband.

578
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:43,938
I know.

579
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,734
Your husband came
and asked me not to tell.

580
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,152
I see.

581
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,864
You already met my husband.

582
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,282
Yes.

583
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,867
But when are you going to get a divorce?

584
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,789
-Sorry?
-I thought you would leave him

585
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,541
once you have recovered.

586
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,751
Dr. Kim.

587
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,421
That was too harsh, even for a joke.

588
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,089
Was it really?

589
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,966
And getting a divorce isn't that easy.

590
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,635
You aren't married, are you?

591
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,804
-No.
-Why not?

592
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,141
I didn't feel confident.

593
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,185
I didn't think I could love one

594
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,896
and stay devoted to our family.

595
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,314
Divorcing takes

596
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,984
a hundred times more courage
compared to getting married.

597
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,695
Anyway, you're very patient.

598
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,615
Are all Koreans like that?

599
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:39,118
You're saying it as
if you aren't Korean yourself.

600
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,620
I'm not Korean.

601
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,082
I'm American.

602
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,129
I was

603
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,090
adopted as a child.

604
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,930
That's the line
that always gets the ladies.

605
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,766
Almost fell for it, didn't you?

606
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,143
No way!

607
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,815
A mother and a woman are
like two completely different species.

608
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,861
Anyway, when you said you were adoptedâ€¦

609
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,989
Were you lying about it or not?

610
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,074
Not telling.

611
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,536
I'm going to leave you hanging
and not tell you.

612
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,582
You should go home. Your eyes look tired.

613
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,460
Yes.

614
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,796
I'm so tired right now.

615
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,631
I could sleep anywhere if I lie down.

616
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,883
-See you tomorrow.
-Yes, I'll be off.

617
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,972
-Goodbye.
-Yes, goodbye.

618
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,824
So? How was the first day
as a first-year at your age?

619
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,117
Was it doable?

620
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,244
What do you think?

621
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,497
The day felt like a year.

622
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,876
I had completely forgotten

623
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:15,256
about the weary
and exhausting life of a resident.

624
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,925
I knew you couldn't be stopped,

625
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,260
so I didn't bother.

626
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,345
But it will be really tough.

627
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,514
Don't try to save your face,

628
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,226
-and take short naps in the bathroom.
-Okay.

629
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,853
And eat well too.

630
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,105
Take every healthy food you can
from red ginseng

631
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,815
to any nutritional supplements.

632
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,359
You have to eat everything
until you feel full.

633
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,237
That's how you're
going to survive, got it?

634
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,407
So just take everything
until you feel full.

635
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,533
Okay?

636
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,493
Jeong-suk?

637
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,078
Jeong-suk?

638
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,206
Jeong-suk.

639
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,707
Cha Jeong-suk.

640
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,000
Are you asleep?

641
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,544
You're doing well. Good.

642
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,921
Good work, Jeong-suk.

643
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,631
You got this!

644
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,477
You're late.

645
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,187
Yes, Mother.

646
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,980
Let's talk for a moment.

647
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,990
Above all, your health should come first.

648
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,661
And think of In-ho and Jung-min,
who are both working at the hospital.

649
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,872
It'll be very uncomfortable for them
to see you roaming about there.

650
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,792
And I-rang too.
Did you forget that she's in 12th grade?

651
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,213
Look what happened today.

652
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,923
You weren't home when she came,

653
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,300
so she took a taxi home
and ate takeout food.

654
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,677
Did you hear me?

655
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,138
Mother, you could help her insteadâ€¦

656
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,974
Do I have to do chores at my age?

657
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,475
I can't do it.

658
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,644
She's your child, so you look after her.

659
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,314
Hey.

660
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,366
-Mom.
-Yes?

661
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,951
Why are you treating Jung-min
and me differently?

662
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,330
-What?
-You didn't neglect Jung-min

663
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,416
when he was in 12th grade
like you're doing now.

664
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,835
In case you've forgotten,
I'm in 12th grade now.

665
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,629
Other moms even quit their jobs
to support their kids in 12th grade.

666
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,339
What do you think you're doing?

667
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,091
Do you want me to go to college or not?

668
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,138
So?

669
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,473
You're the one in 12th grade, not me.

670
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,561
Why do you take my sacrifice for granted
when you're the one going to college?

671
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,396
You're going to college for your sake.

672
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,897
Are you doing that for me?

673
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,569
Yes, I once believed that to be true.

674
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,029
But I have changed my mind.

675
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,740
I already did my best
to raise your brother and you,

676
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,535
and I believe it's about time
you made your own way without my help.

677
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,001
I'll always give you

678
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,545
my love and support.

679
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,506
And I'll do the best I can for you.

680
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,842
-I-rang--
-By "best,"

681
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,677
you just mean doing whatever you want!

682
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,655
My mom won't give me rides anymore.

683
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,908
I have to take a taxi. So annoying.

684
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,162
Me too. That's been my life
ever since I came to Korea.

685
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,246
Eun-seo.

686
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,165
You're home early.

687
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,666
Who are you texting?

688
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,001
A friend from the academy.

689
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,045
She's annoyed that her mom is working now.

690
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,506
But my daughter is so considerate.

691
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,841
How was work?

692
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,967
Work?

693
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,971
It was fine. It's always the same.

694
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,723
That's a relief.

695
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,642
Come out for a snack.

696
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,727
I got your favorite, carrot cake.

697
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,984
Way to paint yourself as a caring mother.

698
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,209
Will you please just let it go today?

699
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,629
The hospital isn't where privileged wives
come to fulfill their dreams.

700
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,214
That's not the case.

701
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,590
First off,

702
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,592
I'm nothing of that sort.

703
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,888
I have always wanted
to become a good doctor.

704
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,974
But after I had Jung-min,

705
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,518
I just chose to be a mother
over being a doctor.

706
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,312
And I've lived enough years as a mom.

707
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,522
After I fell ill,

708
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,733
I realized how noble it was
to work as a doctor.

709
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,613
I finally remembered how desperately
I wanted to become a good doctor.

710
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,031
I really want to do this!

711
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,242
I'm confident enough
to face any hardships.

712
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,036
This isn't a job you can do
with confidence alone!

713
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,746
But why are you adamantly against this?

714
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,876
Is there another reason
why you're stopping me?

715
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,004
Another reason?

716
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,506
What reason?

717
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,966
I wouldn't know.

718
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,052
Only you would.

719
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,599
Fine.

720
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,894
If you so insist, go ahead.

721
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,397
I won't stop you, so do your best.

722
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,691
-Really?
-Yes.

723
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,235
Do what you want,
since it's your decision.

724
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,654
Just pretend we don't
know each other at work.

725
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,116
Don't even dream of whining
or complaining about your tough work.

726
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,534
Do not ask me for help.

727
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,119
Do not expect to receive

728
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,705
any special treatment
just because I'm there.

729
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:43,083
We will be complete strangers
at the hospital.

730
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,046
I will only treat you
as a rookie resident, do you understand?

731
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,672
That's exactly what I want!

732
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,424
Thank you, honey.

733
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,093
Hey, you knowâ€¦

734
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,521
Never mind.

735
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,859
Don't be late tomorrow.

736
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,403
Okay.

737
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,869
At least he said I can do this.

738
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,735
Hello, Professor.

739
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,824
Well, this sucks.

740
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,933
Honey, can you drop me off?

741
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,351
No, I can't.

742
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,271
You can drop me off somewhere far away.

743
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,773
People at the hospital can be there too.

744
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,568
You should hurry.

745
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,945
You might end up arriving after me.

746
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:38,866
Unbelievable.

747
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,377
Here.

748
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,630
Thank you.

749
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,215
Goodbye.

750
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,275
Wait!

751
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,115
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

752
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,412
Good morning.

753
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,091
Judging by how she's not surprised,
they must have met already.

754
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,760
I saw you press the button
to close the door.

755
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,388
Dr. Cha.

756
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,807
-Your check-up is soon, right?
-Yes.

757
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,600
Stop by whenever you can.

758
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,311
It's quite convenient to have your doctor

759
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,813
at the same hospital.

760
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,815
You're completely right.

761
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,359
That's how lucky I am.

762
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:58,987
What's she laughing for?

763
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,999
Have you had breakfast?

764
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,848
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

765
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,815
Professor, I'll brief you on the patient
we were asked to consult on yesterday.

766
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,483
It's a 53-year-old female patient

767
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,819
with a history of diabetes
and high blood pressure.

768
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,529
She had a colonoscopy
as a result of hematochezia

769
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,614
and was diagnosed
with mid to upper-rectal cancer.

770
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,200
A consultation was requested
for her surgical treatment.

771
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,536
Is that so? No obstructions?

772
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,621
Nothing unusual was found
in the abdominal images,

773
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,749
and no signs of metastasis
in her abdominal or chest CT scans.

774
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,960
Was an MRI performed? What about the CRM?

775
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,670
Right.

776
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,007
I don't think

777
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,718
an abdominal MRI was takenâ€¦

778
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,846
One second.

779
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,140
Well.

780
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:11,101
An abdominal MRI

781
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,603
was not necessary, it was not taken.

782
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,438
And the CRMâ€¦

783
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,815
It's rectal cancer,
so I'm asking for a rectal MRI.

784
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,358
Why would I need an abdominal MRI?

785
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,570
Was no rectal MRI taken?

786
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,659
One second.

787
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,036
Wellâ€¦

788
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,498
Yes, she did get a rectal MRI.

789
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,999
What about the CRM?

790
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,752
Right, the CRM.

791
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:42,090
Her file says it's considered positive.

792
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,091
What's CRM?

793
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,094
-Sorry?
-What does CRM stand for?

794
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,057
CRM isâ€¦

795
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:52,851
Circumferential.

796
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,770
Circumferentialâ€¦

797
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:56,813
Câ€¦

798
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,819
I do not know.

799
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,159
CRM is the resection margin
you must consider during surgery.

800
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,619
So what do we do now?

801
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:14,998
Wellâ€¦

802
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,503
I'm sorry.

803
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:24,049
How can you decide on a treatment plan
for a patient when you know so little?

804
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,426
You can't even pretend
to be a doctor at this rate.

805
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,278
I can't believe you slept
before today's round was ready.

806
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,406
You spent a year being an intern.

807
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,533
You still can't tell the difference
between abdominal and rectal MRI?

808
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,410
If you're stupid, at least be diligent!

809
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,538
I'm sorry.

810
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,291
I always tell you
not to do anything to be sorry for.

811
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:58,875
You.

812
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,797
If you stutter or speak nonsense
before tomorrow's round,

813
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,090
you're dead meat.

814
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,551
-Understood?
-Yes.

815
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,938
Jung-min, look at me.

816
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,815
It's okay. You're doing well.

817
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:22,941
-Hey!
-You can do it!

818
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,443
What if someone sees you?

819
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,197
That womanâ€¦

820
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,077
Is she out of her mind?

821
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,545
Why did you do that at work?

822
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,213
I'm sorry.

823
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,015
"That woman"?

824
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,934
I know she was angry,
but that's no way to address someone.

825
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,772
I mean, you're a woman too, aren't you?

826
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,774
Who's going to marry a girl like her?

827
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,903
I'll keep my eyes peeled
and see where she ends up.

828
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,739
You told her to do it?

829
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,074
Are you crazy?

830
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,409
I insisted on sending her
to your department,

831
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,663
but she'll return in three months.
Plus, I'll be her advisor!

832
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,582
-We'll have to make her quit before then.
-How?

833
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,211
This is a tough job to bear
both physically and mentally.

834
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,962
She can't do this for three years.

835
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,382
It sounds like you're worried about her.

836
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,300
She's been at home for 20 years.

837
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,096
She's already bad at her job,
so everyone will be hard on her.

838
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,474
It's only a matter of time
before she falls into despair.

839
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,727
Then are you telling me to wait
until she quits?

840
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,440
If you want it to happen sooner,
you can give her a push.

841
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,358
A push?

842
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,068
How?

843
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,278
Do whatever you can in your position

844
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,155
as her advisor.

845
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,202
I can't believe I have to do this.

846
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,249
It's the chief.

847
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,960
I have to go.

848
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,510
A group dinner?

849
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,138
We have a new professor, Dr. Kim,
and new residents.

850
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,264
It's all for teamwork.

851
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,393
Let's drink up the entire stock
in the restaurant.

852
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,894
Can you two make it?

853
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,146
I can.

854
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,230
Good.

855
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,858
Iâ€¦

856
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,116
Professor Seo, are you okay?

857
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:37,993
Sorry?

858
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,245
You don't look too well.

859
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,413
I see.

860
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,379
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

861
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,384
Why won't you pick up?

862
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,052
Everyone is in the lobby.

863
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,856
-Over here.
-Hello.

864
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,441
Come quickly.

865
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,862
-Come on.
-Drinking requires stamina.

866
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,033
-A thousand?
-Around two thousand after I drink.

867
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,701
-Try it.
-Professor Seo!

868
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,370
Hurry up and join us.

869
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,455
Welcome.

870
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,290
Now we're losing our precious time.

871
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,959
Let's head over and drink
in high spirits. Let's go!

872
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:28,877
-Let's go.
-Go!

873
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:41,932
Keep it together.

874
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:50,524
I thought of making a reservation
at my favorite Italian restaurant,

875
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,567
but I played safe to fit your taste,

876
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,319
so Korean cuisine it is.

877
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,404
I enjoy pasta too.

878
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,034
I always eat Korean food,
and I prefer to make it myself.

879
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,121
I didn't know that.
I'll invite you there next time.

880
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,498
Do as you like.

881
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,292
You seem like such a lady
when you dress up like that.

882
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,795
I always had good looks.

883
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,757
I don't get botox shots like others,
so I have some wrinkles,

884
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,761
but that also adds to my natural beauty.

885
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:30,021
I made gravely misspoke to you
right before Jeong-suk's surgery.

886
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,233
I must have hurt

887
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,194
Jeong-suk and you quite deeply.

888
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,737
I thoughtâ€¦

889
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,284
I would never forget
the disappointment I felt

890
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,661
in In-ho or you.

891
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,415
But it does make me feel better

892
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,876
to hear your apology.

893
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,045
Well, anyway.

894
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,341
You do know that Jeong-suk has
returned to work at the hospital, right?

895
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,221
So this is why she called.

896
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,182
The pride of the Surgery Department,

897
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,811
the soju bomb expert, will show us
how to mix the drinks!

898
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,938
-Give it up!
-All right!

899
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,862
Hurry up and come over.

900
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,078
Dr. Jeon has shown impressive growth.

901
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,290
-That's so fresh.
-Look at that pure alcohol.

902
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:35,921
She's a national treasure.

903
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,554
She's quite the drinker.

904
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,728
Allow me to make a toast.

905
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,022
When I say "soju bombs,"
you say "will be the death of me!"

906
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,152
To Professor Kim from Hollywood
and the new residents,

907
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,236
Soju bombs!

908
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,322
-Will be the death of me!
-Will be the death of me!

909
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,287
You drink very well.

910
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,793
Actually, I was quite the drinker,

911
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,670
but I had held myself back.

912
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,965
A drink after work after such a long time

913
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,968
taste so much sweeter and more delicious.

914
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,970
But still, you can't drink a lot.

915
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,346
Of course I know.

916
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:31,017
But I can feel the alcohol already
from drinking after a rough day.

917
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,268
This is bad.

918
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,397
Well, I guess this is why we drink.

919
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,115
I also thought,

920
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:48,410
"Right, her children are old enough."

921
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,953
"So if she wants to work,

922
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,540
she can work at a small clinic
and get paid for an easy job."

923
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,667
But a residency?

924
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,836
How will she live

925
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,714
through three years of hardships
with her fragile body?

926
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:05,176
I can hardly eat or sleep
with these worries plaguing my mind.

927
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,807
-Ms. Kwak.
-Yes?

928
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,809
You should

929
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,854
try to live honestly.

930
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,858
-What?
-You are very disingenuous.

931
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:23,111
You aren't worried about my daughter.

932
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,489
She's working at In-ho's hospital,

933
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,950
so you're worried
she might cause him trouble.

934
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,619
You're concealing your true feelings
with those words, aren't you?

935
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,753
Yes, you understand very well.

936
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,882
My son isn't going to be just a professor
at a university hospital.

937
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,926
His recent paper was published inâ€¦

938
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,888
What was it called? It was famous.

939
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,097
Nature.

940
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,432
Yes, Natureâ€¦

941
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,562
They chose it as the best paper,
and it became the cover.

942
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,355
In-ho is capable

943
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,693
of becoming the director of the hospital
and rising to much greater power.

944
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,903
So how can his wife

945
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,739
step in and ruin his bright future?

946
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,366
-Ms. Kwak.
-Yes?

947
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,785
Actually,

948
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,205
my daughter had better grades
than your son did.

949
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:20,293
If your son cooperated more
in their marriage,

950
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,837
the best paper in Nature

951
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,881
wouldn't have been written by your son,

952
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,800
but by my daughter.

953
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,136
So this time,

954
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,639
do not say a word,

955
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,390
do not meddle with her business,

956
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,476
and do not do anything.

957
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,228
Do nothing at all.

958
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,653
-Excuse me, four more bottles of beer.
-Sure.

959
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,196
Professor Seo, let me pour one.

960
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,615
It's okay. I've had enough.

961
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:54,369
I don't think I've ever seen you drunk.

962
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,788
My principle is to drink adequately.

963
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,835
My principle is to drink
until there is nothing left.

964
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,086
How embarrassing of me.

965
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,714
If all husbands were half as good as you,

966
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,967
the divorce rate would drop by half.

967
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:13,138
In that aspect,
you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.

968
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,806
Cut it out.

969
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,684
The Nobel Peace Prize?

970
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,895
Yes, when his wife was sick,
he gave her his liver.

971
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,857
No, you tried to. Isn't that right?

972
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:27,944
Well.

973
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,071
It was an inevitable situation.

974
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,534
I'm so jealous.
Your wife must be very happy.

975
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,503
My stomach hurts.

976
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,427
-What was so funny?
-My stomach.

977
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,140
She's a unique one.

978
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,395
I'm sorry.

979
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,856
I haven't had a drink in a while,

980
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,108
so I couldn't contain myself.

981
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:08,610
I'm sorry.

982
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,155
Excuse me!
Two more bottles of beer, please.

983
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:13,907
Okay

984
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,242
Professor Seo, we have lots of beer.

985
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,998
I suddenly want to get drunk.

986
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,467
Jung-min, we need to talk.

987
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,389
Send your mother home now.

988
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,852
Why?

989
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,605
Don't you see it?

990
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,649
She's completely wasted!

991
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,817
She's sitting there
flirting with the new professor!

992
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,696
Then she suddenly broke out in laughter
like she's gone crazy

993
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,406
and killed everyone's vibe!

994
00:58:55,990 --> 00:59:00,954
Do you still need a reason
even after seeing all that?

995
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,290
She had a liver transplant.

996
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,751
The residency is taking a toll on her.

997
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,879
What if her liver is ruined again
after drinking like this?

998
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,923
She seems very happy

999
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,551
since she hasn't been
to places like this in a while.

1000
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,097
She seems tipsy.

1001
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,099
Look after her and prevent any mishaps.

1002
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,475
Okay.

1003
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,060
Please excuse me.

1004
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,039
Jung-min.

1005
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:48,793
How about a drink?

1006
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,461
Have some water.

1007
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,297
Thank you.

1008
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,966
Drink lots of water

1009
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,135
and please pull yourself together.

1010
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,636
Pull myself together?

1011
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,096
I'm fine.

1012
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,472
You're drunk.

1013
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,016
I'm not drunk.

1014
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,100
Stop drinking.

1015
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,143
Hey, Jung-min.

1016
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,811
Yes?

1017
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:07,895
The grill is empty.

1018
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,607
Come and grill more meat.

1019
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,736
Sure.

1020
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,072
Dr. Jeon.

1021
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,201
If you want more meat,
you can grill it yourself.

1022
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,413
-Why are you asking my--
-Hold on! I got it!

1023
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,541
Let me grill the meat. It's fine.

1024
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,501
I'll grill the meat.

1025
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,004
It's okay. I'm good at grilling.

1026
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,507
Excuse me!

1027
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,260
We'll take four more servings
of pork belly.

1028
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:46,434
Dr. Cha, were you a housewife
while you weren't working?

1029
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,311
Yes.

1030
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,896
Your family must be well-off.

1031
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,440
What does your husband do?

1032
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,651
My husband?

1033
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,277
Your husband.

1034
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,792
He's dead.

1035
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,763
-Ow!
-Jung-min!

1036
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,866
DOCTOR CHA

1037
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,264
My husband? He's dead.

1038
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:09,016
He's been dead for a long time.

1039
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,685
She must be out of her mind.

1040
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:11,936
Honey.

1041
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:14,355
You shamelessly lied
that your husband is dead,

1042
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,690
yet you want a favor?

1043
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,735
I hear indoor golf centers are
the hottest place for affairs.

1044
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,320
Honey, did you buy a bracelet?

1045
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,115
Just because I don't
make an issue out of our past

1046
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,825
doesn't mean we can be friends.

1047
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:32,665
