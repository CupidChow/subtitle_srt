00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,532
We have ROSC. Check his vitals, please.

3
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,533
Dr. Cha!

4
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,411
Dr. Cha!

5
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,163
Open your eyes!

6
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,539
Dr. Cha!

7
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:24,959
What's going on?

8
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,713
Dr. Cha!

9
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,633
What happened to her?

10
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,719
She was electrocuted after touching
the patient's body during CPR.

11
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,180
Jeez, she's such a klutz.

12
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,314
What?

13
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,030
You're awake.

14
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,199
Are you okay?

15
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,161
Why am I here?

16
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,412
Do you not remember?

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,374
You fainted
after you were electrocuted during CPR.

18
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,291
Me?

19
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:08,878
I did?

20
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,215
You made a mistake
that not even med students make.

21
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,301
You created a moment
that'll go down in our hospital's history.

22
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,055
Anyway, I think you've laid down enough,
so why don't you get up now?

23
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,975
Okay. I'm sorry.

24
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,232
Why on earth did you do that?

25
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,650
I don't know.

26
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,611
I must've been distracted.

27
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,198
Jeez, this is embarrassing.

28
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,242
That's not the issue.

29
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,870
Do you know how shocked I was?
I mean, earlier…

30
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,873
Father was in the ER at the time,

31
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,751
and he screamed at everyone
and carried you all the way here.

32
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,754
I've never seen him
so flustered like that.

33
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,675
Everyone, out of the way!

34
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,304
No!

35
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,681
No!

36
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,226
Your dad did?

37
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,772
Check up on your mom's condition often
and look out for her.

38
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,692
It might be hard, but I trust
that you'll understand my position.

39
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,194
Keep up the good work.

40
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,781
I'm the one who's doing all the work.

41
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,257
Why did I…

42
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,768
What happened to her?

43
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,437
She was electrocuted after touching
the patient's body during CPR.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,730
Jeez, she's such a klutz.

45
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,001
You have a sense of humanity that I lack.

46
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,463
That's if I were to put it nicely.
To be blunt, you're just nosy.

47
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,381
Anyway,

48
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,509
I let you date me
because of that quality of yours.

49
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,470
But I've been feeling off recently.

50
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,849
Don't you think
you're a bit too friendly with that lady?

51
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,143
-Me?
-Yes.

52
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,856
I'm having trouble
putting a name to this feeling.

53
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,024
Jealousy?

54
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,735
That's a gross way to put it.

55
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,821
Camaraderie…

56
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,991
is a rather contemptible way
to describe it.

57
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,618
The word jealousy grosses me out as well.

58
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,245
It's nothing. It's just…

59
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,289
Let's just go with camaraderie.

60
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,750
That word doesn't cut it.

61
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,837
Let's just call it pity.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,672
Whatever. Think what you want.

63
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,215
More importantly,

64
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,384
you "let me date you"?

65
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,136
"Let me"?

66
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,015
I know I liked you first,
but isn't this some kind of power trip?

67
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,349
You didn't know?

68
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,519
There are power dynamics
in romantic relationships.

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,772
You like me more,
so I have power over you.

70
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,107
Well…

71
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,283
Ma'am.

72
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,868
You're here.

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,334
I'm not too knowledgeable
about art schools,

74
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,419
so I'm not sure exactly how to help you.

75
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,130
Does your mother have
any strategies to support you?

76
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,424
My mom?

77
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,384
When you were preparing for med school,

78
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,636
she was knowledgeable enough
to be a college counselor.

79
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,057
She doesn't know much
about preparing for art school admissions.

80
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,892
And right now,

81
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,479
she's busy pursuing her own career.

82
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,078
Excuse me, Professor.

83
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,794
You have something stuck in your hair.

84
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,712
Here.

85
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,301
Thank you.

86
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,641
Hey, daughter.

87
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,934
Is something the matter?

88
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,520
Was I hallucinating?

89
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,275
"Daughter"?

90
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,070
She has a daughter?

91
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,702
The surgical site is healing well.

92
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,580
I think you'll be able
to be discharged this week.

93
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,792
-Goodness. Thank you, Doctor.
-It's nothing.

94
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,588
-Then I'll see you on my rounds tomorrow.
-Please wait one moment.

95
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:06,968
Here.

96
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,304
I made this
from the apples we raise ourselves.

97
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,764
Please have some together.

98
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,976
-Thank you.
-Yes.

99
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:17,937
Isn't that crazy?

100
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,106
Here, a present.

101
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,484
This apple juice purely consists
of apples raised with love and care.

102
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,945
This is precious stuff,
so be sure to savor every drop.

103
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,405
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

104
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,491
But what was so funny?

105
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,036
Professor, you remember
that older resident right?

106
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,540
The one who asked you for a ride
after the dinner party.

107
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,542
-Dr. Cha Jeong-suk?
-Yes.

108
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:44,672
Apparently, she got electrocuted today
after touching her patient during CPR.

109
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,257
Isn't that wild?

110
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,136
What's her condition? Is she okay?

111
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,346
She didn't get hurt?

112
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,433
Yes, they said she went
right back to work.

113
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,519
Besides, first-year residents
have to act like they're fine

114
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,937
even if they actually aren't.

115
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:00,855
That's a relief.

116
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,277
But is that something to laugh about?

117
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,515
DR. CHA, I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED…

118
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,358
You're going to get the surgery?

119
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,275
Yes.

120
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,362
-You're not going to go to the US?
-I don't want to go.

121
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,447
I'm going to get the surgery here.

122
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,491
I'm counting on you.

123
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,120
Even though I'm not in a position
where I can do much for your surgery,

124
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,541
I must say you really made
the right decision, Chairman Oh.

125
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,042
We'll do our best.

126
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,628
Are you okay?

127
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,214
You fainted while trying to save me.

128
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,009
Who told you that?

129
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,511
I saw it.

130
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,349
But you were in cardiac arrest then.

131
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,353
Well, I experienced something rather odd

132
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,774
that I never thought
I'd come across in my life.

133
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,045
He went on and on
about wanting to be discharged.

134
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,464
He's a nuisance to the very end.

135
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,966
Who said he wasn't?

136
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,428
I guess he won't be able
to go to the US like he wanted.

137
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,183
He just suddenly collapsed.

138
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,893
Do you think I forgot Eun-bi's birthday?

139
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,271
Then what do you expect me to do?

140
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,064
You want me to leave that old geezer?

141
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,774
He's going to kill me.

142
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,568
Can you just let it…

143
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,779
It's just this once.
It's not as if this happens all the time!

144
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,989
Come on!

145
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,324
"Old geezer"?

146
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,409
The weather just had to be great today.

147
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,911
I should be golfing on a day like this!

148
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,165
Are you not worried about your father?

149
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,834
That condescending old man
is called "the phoenix" for a reason.

150
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,879
He'll probably come back
like a phoenix this time too.

151
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,923
He cares about his money too much
to just leave like this.

152
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,676
Aren't you secretly hoping
that he passes away?

153
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,970
Hey, what do you take me for?

154
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,222
What would the need for that be?

155
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,725
In the end,
everything will be mine anyway.

156
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,438
You worthless bastard!

157
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,026
You little bastard.

158
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,861
Where is he?

159
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,957
Charge it to 200J.

160
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,585
Charge it to 200J.

161
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,420
One, two, administering shock.

162
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,971
I don't know if I should say
that I experienced the afterlife,

163
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,224
or that I had an out-of-body experience.

164
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,310
Anyway,

165
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,188
experiencing death made me realize

166
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,357
that I needed to live.

167
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:36,612
No matter how crappy life might be,
living is always better than dying.

168
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,280
If I die, it's only a loss for me.

169
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,366
Dr. Cha.

170
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,701
Set a date for my surgery.

171
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,120
Yes, Chairman Oh.

172
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,290
I understand, as someone
who was on the brink of death as well.

173
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,294
You should survive until the very end
and do everything you want.

174
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,255
-So you won't have any regrets.
-Shall I?

175
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,841
-My goodness. Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

176
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,010
Jeez, you startled me.
Chairman Oh, you have to be careful.

177
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,679
I'm fine.

178
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,225
I have two problematic patients, you know?

179
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,647
Because they keep telling me
that they don't want to get treated.

180
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,444
But among the two, one of them told me
today that he will get his surgery.

181
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:22,241
You can't imagine how hard he cried
when he heard about his condition.

182
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,244
I felt so terrible.

183
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,704
It's such a relief now.

184
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,749
When I first learned of my condition,

185
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,585
I cried too.

186
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,921
Because I was so thankful.

187
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,219
It was like a gift to me…

188
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,808
since I didn't have
the courage to kill myself.

189
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:53,731
I had the guts
to take someone else's life,

190
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:58,235
but I didn't have
the nerve to take my own.

191
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,696
You said you don't have the nerve,

192
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,992
but how were you able to do
that to someone else?

193
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,129
-Doctor.
-Yes?

194
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,674
Could you please prescribe me
some cold medicine?

195
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,884
Are you sick?

196
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,302
I'm aching all over.

197
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,472
A family member of the corrections officer
for the next shift passed away.

198
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,142
Goodness, it's going to be hard
to prescribe medicine in the ward.

199
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,894
But I'll try to go find some medicine.

200
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,069
DR. CHA, I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED,
ARE YOU…

201
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,046
Professor!

202
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,006
What brings you here?

203
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,969
I thought Chief Resident Hwang
might be here.

204
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,471
She's not here right now.
Is she not answering her phone?

205
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,723
I'll try calling her.

206
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,684
Okay, then I'll get going now.

207
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,235
She seems fine.

208
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,201
Mom.

209
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,578
I need to talk to you.

210
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,289
-Right now?
-Yes, right now.

211
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,500
Okay.

212
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,884
The art academy instructors can only do
so much for my art project report.

213
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,305
It's critical for early admissions,
but it's beyond my ability to do it alone.

214
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,640
I looked into it,

215
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,310
and there are consultants
that specialize in art school--

216
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,562
Mom!

217
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,649
Did I nod off?

218
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,903
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired these days.

219
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,113
Where did we leave off?

220
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,033
Forget it. Why bother
when you're not even interested in me?

221
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,452
Come on, it's not like that.

222
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,662
Why would I have no interest in you?

223
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,665
Then are you aware I had a consultation
with my homeroom teacher today?

224
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,922
I've just been so out of it these days.

225
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,006
I-rang,

226
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,009
I went through a lot today, okay?

227
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,136
I'll explain--

228
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,596
I don't need your explanation.

229
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,890
Let's just live our lives
separately from now on.

230
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,684
That's what you'll prefer anyway.

231
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,103
I-rang.

232
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,944
What are you doing?

233
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,654
You startled me.

234
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,342
Are you asleep?

235
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,678
No.

236
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,891
But why are you like that?

237
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,726
Did something bad happen?

238
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,936
No.

239
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,313
What is it?

240
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,023
What?

241
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,945
Come here.

242
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:29,989
Why?

243
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,282
Stop talking back and just come over here.

244
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,999
What is it?

245
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,339
Is it my birthday present?

246
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,757
That bracelet?

247
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,725
It's so pretty.

248
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,602
Honey, it's so pretty.

249
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,354
Give it to me.

250
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,401
It's beautiful.

251
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,195
I'm glad to hear you like it.

252
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,993
I'll cherish this forever.

253
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,870
Thank you, honey.

254
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,873
Come on, don't go overboard.
I can just buy you another one.

255
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,917
This is the first present
I've received from you.

256
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,753
So it's that much more meaningful.

257
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,546
First?

258
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,424
Makes you think you've been
too neglectful, doesn't it?

259
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,219
And about I-rang.

260
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,222
It seems like she's being rebellious,
which is unlike her.

261
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,557
It's all my fault.

262
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,894
She's in 12th grade.
I should have taken better care of her.

263
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,187
How about

264
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,733
you delay your residency for a year

265
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,359
until I-rang gets into med school?

266
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,073
If you still haven't changed your mind
after I-rang gets into med school,

267
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,616
it won't be late to start then.

268
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,369
I do feel bad about I-rang.

269
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,502
Of course you do.

270
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,756
Her mother turned a blind eye to her
at such an important time in her life,

271
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,800
which resulted in her feeling
isolated and rebellious.

272
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,928
How much pain she must be in, right?

273
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,013
I think I might have taken

274
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,892
the kids' problems too lightly.

275
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,401
By the way, honey,

276
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,032
I think Seung-hi has a daughter too.

277
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,414
Really?

278
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,599
Eat up.

279
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,230
Do you feel good
about stuffing your faces by yourselves?

280
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,568
What? Damn it!

281
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,572
What? You are worthless!

Why are you suddenly asking me

Mom, I got paid today.

I don't need anything.
Just spend it on yourself.

291

311
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,101
I think it'd be correct
to proceed with a laparotomy.

312
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,395
But I feel like a laparoscopy
would be worth a shot too.

313
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,606
Laparoscopic surgery
would be the best bet given his age.

314
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,733
He'll recover faster,
and there are lower chances

315
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,111
of complications
such as abdominal adhesions.

316
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,154
This patient is
a particularly delicate case.

317
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,739
Of course that might be the case…

318
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,533
Given the liver lesions,

319
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,660
a laparoscopic surgery
would be pushing it.

320
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,704
If we do an RFA after the incision,

321
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,455
we'll be able to get most of it.

322
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,582
So laparotomy would be the best.

323
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,627
It's metastasized through the liver
and artery lymph nodes.

324
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,505
Shouldn't we remove the portions
we are certain about

325
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,758
and then do chemotherapy
before performing another surgery?

326
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,218
We don't want to push things.

327
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,305
We all know the best course of action
is to perform R0 resection

328
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,600
for patients who have colorectal cancer
that has metastasized to the liver.

329
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,854
Administering a treatment
when cancer cells are remaining

330
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,398
will cause the patient's state to worsen.

331
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,067
We must give the patient
the best treatment

332
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,194
within the bounds of
what the patient's condition allows.

333
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,822
Isn't that
what an oncologic surgeon should do?

334
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,243
I will judge whether I'm pushing things
too far or not.

335
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,958
I hope this doesn't offend you,

336
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:19,212
but do you have the skill to remove
all the metastasized cancer in the liver?

337
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,882
I think you're being too daring.

338
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,384
You're right.

339
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,762
I am a bit daring.

340
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,847
Because I am that competent.

341
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,478
It's as if I'm watching
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

342
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,897
-You can have a go at each other
-Shall I?

343
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,388
Lift up the intestine.

344
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,431
Okay.

345
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,100
-Bring in the camera.
-Okay.

346
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,602
Turn the camera's angle to the left.

347
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,355
Compared to the footage,

348
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,524
the invasion into
the sphincter isn't as deep.

349
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,275
I think we can save the exterior.

350
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,195
We can preserve the anus
by removing the sphincter.

351
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,863
The patient will be so pleased.

352
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,073
I know.

353
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,326
We'll have to add a temporary stoma,
but it can be removed in a few months.

354
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,913
-Okay, I'll move downward now.
-Okay.

355
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,207
SURGERY DURATION, ANESTHESIA DURATION

356
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,169
-Provide suction for the fluid.
-Yes, sir.

357
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,421
This patient is famous.

358
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,799
If word gets around
that you operated on him,

359
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,884
you'll get even busier.

360
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,012
Every patient is the same for me.

361
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,931
Scissors, please.

362
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,399
Why is he already waiting?

363
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,442
I would've called him when we were done.

364
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,402
Right?

365
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,540
Things worked out so well, Chairman Oh.

366
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,917
I thought even your anus
would have to be removed,

367
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,086
but thankfully that wasn't necessary.

368
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,674
Congratulations on being able
to preserve your anus.

369
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,344
Yes, it worked out well.

370
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,387
Of course.

371
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,725
Your quality of life changes drastically
depending on if you have an anus or not.

372
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,353
The artificial stoma will only be in place
while you undergo chemotherapy.

373
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,023
What are you so happy about?

374
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:49,029
None of my children even care
if I carry a poop bag around or not.

375
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,907
Goodness, no way.

376
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:57,162
They may not express it,
but I bet they are feeling relieved.

377
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,873
And I…

378
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,710
bought this to give to you.

379
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,545
What is that?

380
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,715
Once you attach the stoma,
you'll have to wear bigger underwear,

381
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,217
so I bought this.

382
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,511
But since it's temporary,
I'll get a refund for this.

383
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,556
Why would you refund my gift?

384
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,433
-Give it to me.
-It's big for you.

385
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,393
Goodness, all I have is money.

386
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,437
I'll have it tailored. Give it to me.

387
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,147
-Really?
-Give it to me.

388
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,650
-I'll open it for you.
-Okay.

389
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,943
-Do you want to see?
-Sure.

390
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,029
Goodness.

391
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,920
You regret being mean to me
when we first met, don't you?

392
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,301
But this isn't from the department store.

393
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,555
-Just give it back.
-No, it's fine.

394
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,557
-I'll return--
-You already gave it to me.

395
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,007
Going down.

396
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,176
The doors are closing.

397
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,146
You must be going home.

398
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,647
Yes.

399
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,331
Going down.

400
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,208
The doors are closing.

401
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,585
PROFESSOR SEO IN-HO

402
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,808
Dr. Moon.

403
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,810
Which way is your home?

404
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,897
Have you gotten closer to your colleagues?

405
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,066
It's still a bit awkward.

406
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,400
Why?

407
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,069
Do you not get along?

408
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,822
It's not that we don't get along,

409
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,784
but some bad rumors
are going around the hospital.

410
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,577
So it's making things awkward.

411
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,914
-Bad rumors?
-You didn't hear?

412
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,959
They say Dr. Cha and GS Professor Seo
are seeing each other.

413
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,669
The whole hospital knows about the rumor.

414
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,676
What are you talking about?

415
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,221
It's just a rumor going around.

416
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,723
When Dr. Cha fainted
while she was administering CPR,

417
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,975
Professor Seo ran over
and worried about her--

418
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,727
Stop saying such nonsense!

419
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,188
They were just colleagues in med school.

420
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,981
Can't friends worry about each other?

421
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:17,404
And why are you going around and spreading
rumors that haven't been confirmed?

422
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,073
Do you not have
any loyalty to your colleagues?

423
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,344
Take it. I don't need it.

424
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,221
What do you mean? What happened?

425
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,850
How can I go around wearing
the same bracelet your wife has?

426
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,314
How could you buy us
the exact same bracelet?

427
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,650
Seung-hi, calm down.
Why don't we sit down first?

428
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,162
Jeong-suk found the receipt.

429
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,831
The receipt for the bracelet I gave you.

430
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,627
I told her it was for her birthday,
so I had no choice.

431
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,672
Honestly, this is driving me crazy too!

432
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,344
I'll make sure this never happens again.

433
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,305
I'm really sorry.

434
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,515
Shall I get you another gift?

435
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,230
He never says he's going to leave her.

436
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,657
We got off early, so how about a latte?

437
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,075
Okay, let's go.

438
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,704
Eun-seo.

439
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,291
Who is that?

440
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,918
Your mom?

441
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,505
Sorry, I have to go.
Let's grab a latte together next time.

442
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,769
I haven't picked you up in forever, right?

443
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,063
How about we get something to eat?

444
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,190
-What do you want to eat?
-Let's just go home.

445
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,566
Without eating?

446
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,528
-Why? We can eat the sushi you--
-I said let's just go home!

447
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,467
Choi Eun-seo.

448
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,303
Eun-seo.

449
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,013
What's wrong?

450
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,765
Why are you so angry?

451
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,183
Get out.

452
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,648
You have to tell me
what you're angry about to get over it.

453
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,734
You should find a nice guy and marry him.

454
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,863
Where did that come from?

455
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,907
I have no plans
to get a stepfather for you.

456
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,828
Why? Did that man tell you not to marry?

457
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,289
"That man"?

458
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,832
He's your dad, Eun-seo.

459
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,918
How can I call him "Dad"
when I'm just his mistress' daughter?

460
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,838
What? Am I wrong?

461
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,631
It's true that you're his mistress!

462
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,263
Choi Eun-seo!

463
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,351
If that's not true, why am I Choi Eun-seo?

464
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,980
If I'm not just his mistress' daughter,
why am I not Seo Eun-seo?

465
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:43,526
You're at an age where I don't
have to explain every detail to you.

466
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,322
Do you really want to hurt me
like an immature teenager?

467
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,073
Am I the only one who's hurting you?

468
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,409
You're the one
who had a kid with a married man!

469
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,245
You're the reason
I can't ever call my dad "Dad"!

470
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,581
Even if you get married and settle down,

471
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,334
a lot of things can change with time.

472
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,377
Can't you just think of it that way?

473
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,630
I can't understand it and I don't want to!

474
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:06,841
Just…

475
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,053
Just give me some time.

476
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,932
-It may be late, but I'll--
-But what?

477
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,851
Did he say he'll divorce his wife
and come to you?

478
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,854
Do you believe that?

479
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,025
Even I can tell that's a plain lie.

480
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,778
How can you be so naive at that age
to believe all that?

481
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,574
How long do I have to be the bad guy here?

482
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,409
You shouldn't have had me then.

483
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,787
You should've lived your life alone.

484
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,080
Why did you have me

485
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,208
just to get abandoned by your family
and treated like this by your daughter?

486
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,086
Because I wanted to meet you so badly.

487
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,383
I wanted to meet you so badly
that I gave birth to you.

488
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,635
Because I wanted to meet you so much!

489
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:16,411
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

490
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,639
Yes, come in.

491
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,558
The meeting minutes?

492
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:42,228
Yes. There's a seminar
at half past seven on the fifth floor,

493
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,856
and you'll have to come in
and record the minutes.

494
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,233
Just come after work.

495
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,069
I see.

496
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,155
Why? You don't want to do it?

497
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,158
Yes, I refuse.

498
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,036
Are there no other residents here?

499
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,412
Why are you asking me

500
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,040
when I'm currently dispatched
to a different department?

501
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,207
Furthermore…

502
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,711
why are you suddenly
speaking casually toward me?

503
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,755
You don't want to do it?

504
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,925
Of course not. I'll do it.

505
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,264
Go to the in-house library
and get these materials for me.

506
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,939
Please organize these materials.

507
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,576
Make a presentation
for tomorrow morning's meeting.

508
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,300
Can you type up this thesis?

509
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,553
My wrists aren't in good shape.

510
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,560
Can you type faster?

511
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,775
You're so slow.

512
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,822
Hello.

513
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,788
Thank you.

514
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,420
Have I gotten a lot worse?

515
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,093
As expected,
your LFT has elevated slightly.

516
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,513
You are taking
your immunosuppressants regularly, right?

517
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,515
Yes.

518
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,061
To be honest, I sometimes forget
because I'm so busy.

519
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,396
No matter how busy you are,

520
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,524
you can't forget to take them
and need to take them on time.

521
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,693
Doing that once
or twice won't do much harm.

522
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,070
But in the worst-case scenario,
your liver could get damaged again.

523
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,824
You can't slack off
just because you feel all right now.

524
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,873
I don't know if it's right
to say not to work too hard,

525
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,292
but your health has to take priority.

526
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,044
Always remember this.

527
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,463
"My liver is precious."

528
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:28,019
ANNEX SURGERY ROOM

529
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,690
Why not send the dispatched residents
from family medicine to my department?

530
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,569
I don't know about that.

531
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:40,573
The family medicine doctors don't seem
to prefer working in your department.

532
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:44,285
For primary care, they need to learn
about the stomach and intestines,

533
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,495
I don't know if they'll have
the time to go to you.

534
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,791
Family medicine doctors should know about
hepatobiliary and pancreatic conditions

535
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,961
like acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis.

536
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,422
I'm sorry.

537
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,924
I'm short on hands too.

538
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,524
Gosh, you startled me!

539
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,610
Goodness, Dr. Jeon.

540
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,028
Why are you so shocked?

541
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,657
I mean, how could I not get shocked
when you're standing there like a ghost?

542
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,368
I was just seeing
if you were giving out the wrong order.

543
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,454
Your eyes were half-closed.

544
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,416
I was focused
and entered everything in perfectly.

545
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,169
I have one thing to ask you.

546
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,963
To ask me?

547
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,340
What's going on
between you and Professor Seo?

548
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,804
What do you mean?

549
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,556
There are rumors
about you two being a couple.

550
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,811
Someone asked me, but I couldn't refute it
since I don't know the details.

551
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,981
Since it's a bother
to be continually asked this,

552
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,109
will you just be straight with me
and tell me if it's a yes or a no?

553
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,030
Nothing is going on between us.

554
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,079
You're getting excessively worked up
for it to be nothing.

555
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,126
I'll let it go for now.

556
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,637
"Seeing each other"?

557
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,014
Yes.

558
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,266
Professor Seo and Dr. Cha.

559
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,936
Does that lady have some kind
of irresistible charm I don't know about?

560
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,314
Why do men swarm around her?

561
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,733
She seems close to Professor Roy too.

562
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,276
You always talk about her too.

563
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,612
Why is everybody so eager
to get involved with her?

564
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,533
Damn it.

565
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,037
Focus.

566
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,330
This is about your father.

567
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,336
-It's just a rumor.
-How would you know?

568
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,297
Darn you.

569
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,090
Keep a close eye on the professor.

570
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:16,896
Normally I shouldn't be doing this,
but I'm having trouble standing.

571
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,815
A colleague of mine
will come within an hour.

572
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,651
Can I ask you
to watch over her until then?

573
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,029
Okay, it's a simple test
so it won't take too long.

574
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:30,284
But the patient has a wound on her wrist.

575
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,329
Is there a way to slightly loosen
the handcuffs?

576
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,763
Okay, we'll be back soon.

577
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,941
Today we're going
to take an X-ray and do an ECG.

578
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,777
These are simple tests,
so you don't have to worry.

579
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,613
Dr. Cha.

580
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,617
-Are you free?
-I need to run some tests.

581
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,452
Go to Gangnam Hospital right away.

582
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,956
My research materials are there,
and I need you to get them.

583
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,172
I'll give you a contact
so you can get the materials.

584
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,215
But--

585
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,925
One second.

586
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,136
Excuse me, Dr. Choi.

587
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,555
Excuse me, Dr. Choi.

588
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,266
Can I go in one hour?

589
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,476
I have to be
with the patient for her tests.

590
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,855
Since when do residents
go and oversee a patient's tests?

591
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,314
The thing is…

592
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,900
-Say goodbye.
-Bye.

593
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,573
Get an intern to take care
of the patient's tests and go.

594
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,364
Ma'am, are you all right?

595
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,033
Where are you going?

596
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,452
You must be staying
at Gusan University Hospital.

597
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,038
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to ask this of a stranger,

598
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,458
but can you lend me some money for a taxi?

599
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,214
-What do I do?
-What's wrong?

600
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,549
Ms. Jang Hae-nam disappeared.

601
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,388
You haven't found Ms. Jang Hae-nam?

602
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:57,932
No.

603
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,226
Are you out of your mind?

604
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,228
-I'm sorry.
-Shut up!

605
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,815
How dare an incompetent resident
like you humiliate our hospital?

606
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,068
There's a bed but no patient!

607
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,362
Damn it!

608
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,043
Wait in the medical office.

609
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,778
Where are you heading?

610
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,574
To Gupabal.

611
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,409
Where in Gupabal?

612
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,911
Gupabal.

613
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,870
Well…

614
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,666
I'm not sure if it's still there.

615
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,544
What was the name of that church?

616
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,840
Goodness, I can't seem to remember it.

617
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,216
Ma'am.

618
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,594
Do you know your home phone number?

619
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,345
Home phone number?

620
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,016
Do you know the cell phone number
of any of your family members?

621
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,310
Your kids.

622
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,894
I have a daughter.

623
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,857
I want to see her

624
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,236
just once…

625
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,239
before I die.

626
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,249
Dr. Cha!

627
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,667
They found her?

628
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,004
The police station called.
A taxi driver brought her to the police.

629
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,674
She was speaking incoherently
so the driver thought she had dementia.

630
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,092
Is she all right?

631
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,261
Yes, you don't have to worry.

632
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,596
It worked out.

633
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,807
That's such a relief.

634
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,060
It's such a relief.

635
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,902
CHIEF LIM JONG-KWON

636
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,035
Do you think you can continue to work?

637
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,120
What?

638
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,123
Honestly, I've had a lot of worries
ever since you came here.

639
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:33,629
It's possible to cover up any trouble
you cause within this department.

640
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,298
But nothing can be done
about the trouble you cause

641
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,800
in another department.

642
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:42,971
-I'm sorry--
-That's why we avoid old residents.

643
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,933
If someone young makes a mistake,
it's just a mistake.

644
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,935
But if someone older makes a mistake,

645
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,853
it's incompetence.

646
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,940
If your livelihood isn't at stake,

647
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,692
perhaps you could reconsider
your position here.

648
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,612
Do you mean I should quit?

649
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,782
Did it sound like I meant that?

650
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,953
I just meant you should
give it some thought.

651
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,874
Professor, it's my fault that the patient
escaped due to my carelessness.

652
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,210
I have no excuses to give on that matter.

653
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,838
But I find it unfair that
a mistake is equated

654
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,841
to incompetence just because I'm older.

655
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,803
I'm still just a first-year resident
who has a lot to learn.

656
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,888
Are you going home?

657
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,514
Yes.

658
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,974
How are you getting home?

659
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,022
I feel like I've become useless.

660
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,775
I'm such an idiot at the hospital.

661
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,694
My body isn't the same as before.

662
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,072
And I've neglected my daughter
who's trying to get into college.

663
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,576
Is it right for me to continue doing this?

664
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,037
Then just quit.

665
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:35,125
Even easy tasks feel hard
if you haven't done them in 20 years.

666
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,419
Not to mention the work doctors do.

667
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,005
That's true.

668
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,759
If you're not confident,
you should just quit sooner than later.

669
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,595
You won't learn anything at the hospital
with that attitude.

670
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,890
I have plans,
so I'll take a taxi from here.

671
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,085
It's a relief you're healthy
and being discharged.

672
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,753
I still have to undergo chemotherapy.

673
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,549
Don't be discouraged
just because you're older.

674
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,843
Make sure to learn a lot
and become a great doctor.

675
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,972
When you start your own practice,
I'll be your patient.

676
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,392
Just imagining it makes me happy.

677
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,977
Why leave it just as an imagination?

678
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,436
You can make it a reality.

679
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:41,316
But why do you look so sad?
Did something bad happen?

680
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,944
Do I look sad?

681
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:45,988
Gosh.

682
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,241
I'm sorry. I'm being silly.

683
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,077
Don't be like that and come sit here.

684
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,833
Come on.

685
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,877
What's wrong? Tell me everything.

686
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,256
Once you let everything out,
you'll feel better.

687
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,092
I'm afraid…

688
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,054
I'll have to quit working at the hospital.

689
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,222
Why?

690
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,475
Because I'm lacking in so many ways,

691
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,102
and I'm foolish.

692
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,064
You're literally blinded
by your own privilege.

693
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,319
You should be thankful
for this chance at your age.

694
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,321
What kind of gibberish are you saying?

695
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,325
Stop saying such useless things
and think about learning and improving.

696
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,703
You should learn by taking things
one step at a time

697
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,246
and become a great doctor.

698
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,833
Why are you laughing?

699
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,752
I'm being serious right now.

700
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,007
You sound like my father.

701
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,180
If my father were still alive,

702
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,477
I think he would scold me
just like you did.

703
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,399
But…

704
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,652
later on…

705
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,489
he would say,

706
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,075
"Fine, do whatever you want."

707
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,120
So?

708
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,040
Are you just going to quit?

709
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,677
Why would you come to my office
when you can talk to me at home?

710
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,097
Do you know there's a rumor about us
that something is going on

711
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,682
between us?

712
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,392
I know.

713
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,103
You know?

714
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,646
Yes, I know.

715
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,399
That's it? Nothing else comes to mind?

716
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,068
You said your husband is dead
so it might not hurt you,

717
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,861
but I'm an officially married man.

718
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,656
How will I be able to face my patients

719
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,242
when I'm labeled as some sordid cheater?

720
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,786
Do you only care
about your professional achievements?

721
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,914
Do you not care if your husband
and son's reputations are destroyed?

722
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,374
Were you always this selfish?

723
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,042
I'm going to quit the hospital.

724
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,127
What--

725
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,381
Does that make you feel better?

726
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,179
Why do you have to put it that way?

727
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,727
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

728
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,603
It's not sudden.

729
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,107
I only prepared for the resident exam.

730
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,277
I make mistakes
all the time at the hospital.

731
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,822
And my health isn't great.

732
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,619
More importantly, I need to help I-rang
with her college admissions.

733
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,748
They say your kids
are the scariest people you'll meet.

734
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:46,460
What will I do if she blames me
if she doesn't get into college?

735
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:47,961
Right.

736
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,255
That's a good idea.

737
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,343
When will you tell the hospital?

738
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,181
In a few days.

739
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,850
I need some time to sort things out.

740
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,061
I don't want to cause trouble
to the department I've been dispatched to.

741
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:09,649
I was sent here
because the resident before me quit.

742
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,526
So how can I just quit too?

743
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,739
You don't have to worry about that.
What you think matters most.

744
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,703
Will they allow me
to take a one-year break?

745
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,167
Don't worry.

746
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:31,838
If they don't accept you next year,
I'll pull some strings

747
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,717
and find you a spot in another hospital.

748
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:40,722
Thank you.

749
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,028
She's going to quit?

750
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,530
I'm sure of it.

751
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,493
You must have had a hard time.

752
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,495
I'm sorry.

753
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,206
Her quitting takes care
of one of my worries.

754
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,125
Will I see you in the conference room?
I heard there's some sort of event.

755
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,627
I heard about it.

756
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,171
-If I have time, I'll go.
-Okay.

757
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,215
Let's see each other if we can.

758
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,853
This looks so delicious.

759
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,813
Do you even have time to make it at home?

760
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,607
-I should have made it for you.
-No need.

761
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:36,987
Mom.

762
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,655
I am…

763
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,199
going to quit the hospital.

764
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:42,826
What?

765
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:44,870
Why?

766
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,664
Is it too hard for you to continue?

767
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,457
Yes, and also…

768
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,294
I-rang is in 12th grade,

769
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,921
and she's having trouble
since I'm not there to help her.

770
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,049
I see.

771
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,013
I'm sure you've thought this through.

772
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,599
Don't be disappointed.

773
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,559
Your health is the top priority,

774
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,478
and they say kids are more precious
than any treasure.

775
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,773
There's nothing
more precious in the world.

776
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,068
I didn't expect you to react like this.

777
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,530
I thought you'd be more upset than me.

778
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,909
That's because
you were so young back then.

779
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,620
And it was obvious
your mother-in-law would harass you.

780
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:32,125
But you were able to raise
Jung-min and I-rang until now.

781
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:37,172
If you think about that, there's nothing
to be disappointed or upset about.

782
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,592
Right.

783
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,302
You're right.

784
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,680
What you say is always right.

785
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:53,146
I made an appointment
for your checkup at this hospital.

786
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,108
That's the least
I can do for you before I quit.

787
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,487
You're so stubborn!
I told you there's no need for that!

788
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,323
Goodness, Mom.
You're the one that's stubborn.

789
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,449
I'm not going to do it!

790
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,034
No, just do it.

791
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:06,952
No.

792
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:07,994
Come on!

793
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,974
Goodness.

794
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,060
Dr. Cha, what brings you here?

795
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,062
You've already heard?

796
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,772
No, it's not that.

797
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,400
I just had something to tell you.

798
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,819
It's a good thing you came.
What perfect timing.

799
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:44,864
The hospital director wants to see you.
Come with me.

800
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,449
The hospital director?

801
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:49,744
Hello.

802
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,832
Hello.

803
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,922
I've lived 76 years,

804
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:05,468
but I lived as a miser
who didn't even spend 100 won on others.

805
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:10,890
Even I am moved by the fact
that I am donating not 100 won

806
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,059
or one million won,

807
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:16,646
but ten billion won.

808
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,818
I would first like
to sincerely thank Professor Seo In-ho

809
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:26,489
and Professor Roy Kim for operating on me.

810
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,868
10 BILLION WON DONATION CEREMONY

811
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:40,712
But there is another doctor
who helped give me this new life.

812
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,256
And that

813
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,216
is Dr. Cha Jeong-suk.

814
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,349
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk,
please come up to the stage.

815
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,857
Come up here.

816
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:08,948
While others treated me
kindly on the outside

817
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,369
and treated me with contempt inside
for being a cranky old man,

818
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,330
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk was different.

819
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,045
When I broke down
and cried due to my condition,

820
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,047
she treated me sincerely and comforted me.

821
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,174
I'm sorry.

822
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:30,678
And when my heart stopped,
she gave it her all to save me.

823
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:35,141
After she found out I didn't have to use
a permanent stoma bag after surgery,

824
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,018
she was happier for me

825
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,813
than even my own kids.

826
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:47,946
She had unconditional compassion for me.

827
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,159
Dr. Cha.

828
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,912
Thank you so much.

829
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:01,417
I won't forget this until I die.

830
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:13,805
I'm not sure
if it's because the work is hard,

831
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:17,433
but Dr. Cha said that she might quit.

832
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,895
But I will keep
my eyes peeled for you all.

833
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:24,566
If you let this kind of talent get away,
this hospital has no future.

834
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,361
And I'm going to take back
every single bit of my ten billion won.

835
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,911
I am going to continuously storm in here

836
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,915
and check until Dr. Cha Jeong-suk
becomes a specialist.

837
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,962
Actually, it would even be better
if she became a professor here.

838
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,673
If Dr. Cha wants to do research,

839
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:53,595
I will fund it all, no questions asked!

840
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,743
DONATION AGREEMENT

10 BILLION WON DONATION CEREMONY

843
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,249
CHAIRMAN OH CHANG-GYU,
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

844
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,877
Dr. Cha.

845
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,506
Professor Seo, you too.

846
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,186
All right.

847
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:46,189
In honor of Dr. Cha Jeong-suk,

848
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,066
please give another round of applause.

849
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,213
He's going to buy us
two robotic surgical systems.

850
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,048
She's our lucky charm.

851
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,967
I knew it from the first time I saw her.

852
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,843
-Take good care of her.
-I will.

853
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,971
Professor Seo, you must be happy.

854
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,472
Yes.

855
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,650
Excuse me, I'll get going first.

856
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,568
Okay.

857
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,861
You get involved in everything.

858
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,162
Dr. Cha.

859
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,666
Are you really going to quit?

860
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:53,881
Are you crazy?

861
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,356
DOCTOR CHA

862
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,671
A murderer escaped the hospital
without authorization.

863
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,215
I don't think this is
something to be taken lightly.

864
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,551
Why are you so keen on kicking me out?

865
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:42,347
How about you stop deceiving your wife?

866
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,265
You and Professor Choi Seung-hi.

867
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,601
I think maybe
that guy is interested in you.

868
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,729
No matter what happens,
you need to stay strong.

869
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,441
-What brings you here?
-I have something to tell you.

870
01:00:55,526 --> 01:01:00,531
