00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,639
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

3
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,393
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

4
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:05,065
-Happy birthday, dear my wife
-Happy birthday, dear Jeong-suk

5
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,569
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

6
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,497
So…

7
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,707
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk

8
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,378
is Professor Seo In-ho's wife
and your mother?

9
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,548
-That's…
-Your face says it all.

10
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,801
-I mean, it's not that--
-Forget it.

11
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,095
I need to be alone, so get lost.

12
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,064
Honey!

13
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,244
What? Who is he calling "honey"?

14
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,954
"Honey" as in his love?

15
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,462
Honey! Come here.

16
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,214
Sing a song

17
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,759
with me!

18
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,059
SEOPGYO-RI REST AREA

19
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,021
Come on.

20
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,775
-Professor Seo, what's wrong with you?
-Let go.

21
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,944
Jeong-suk, hurry up and come.

22
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,070
"Jeong-suk, hurry up and come"?

23
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,072
Cha Jeong-suk!

24
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,241
Come on up already!

25
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,242
Professor Seo.

26
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,203
She never listens to me.

27
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,713
Go away.

28
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,464
I said go away.

29
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,425
-Stay right there.
-Don't come close.

30
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,260
-Go away.
-Stay right there.

31
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,013
Put this down.

32
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,223
No.

33
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,059
Put it here.

34
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,478
Go.

35
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,232
Is this true?

36
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,572
This person is my wife.

37
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,240
She sings…

38
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,119
super well.

39
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:30,084
Honey, sing one song for me.

40
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,347
See? I told you, didn't I?

41
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,101
This is unbelievable.

42
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,067
Dr. Cha, why are you playing along?

43
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,985
What's done is done.

44
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,534
I'm Cha Jeong-suk,
whose husband was just revealed!

45
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,914
Ladies and gentlemen of this village,
please stand up and sing along!

46
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,799
Come on!

47
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,971
When we first fell in love

48
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,057
He was a dashing man

49
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,061
He reassured and promised me

50
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,397
The moon and the stars in the night sky

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,274
This punk.

52
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,068
Now he has changed

53
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,152
Is it true?

54
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,780
-He tells me to do everything for him
-Yes.

55
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,781
She's your wife?

56
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,951
My love has become a child

57
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,246
I really hate you so much

58
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,001
Men

59
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,879
Really

60
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,300
-Bother
-Drive them mad!

61
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,303
-Drive them mad--
-Women

62
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,099
Men

63
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,853
Really

64
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:17,817
Bother women

65
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,031
-You need to go.
-Professor Kim.

66
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,282
I love you.

67
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,121
Good job trying to hide everything.

68
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,709
-What?
-No wonder you were so caring to her.

69
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,129
You look alike.

70
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,423
Dr. Seo.

71
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,176
-Seo Jung-min, come here.
-Come here.

72
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,595
Yes?

73
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,347
You need to tell the truth right now.

74
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,518
Is Dr. Cha your mother
and Professor Seo your father?

75
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,229
I'm asking you again.

76
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,773
Did Dr. Cha give birth to you

77
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,067
and did Professor Seo take part
in making that happen?

78
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,068
Well…

79
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,321
Judging by how you're speechless,
it must be true.

80
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,615
Your whole family is made up of surgeons.

81
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,242
How did you find out?

82
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,620
Professor Seo
just revealed it to everyone.

83
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,662
My father did?

84
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,540
You should've given us a heads-up!
You completely fooled us.

85
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,918
Why is the Surgery Department so…

86
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,628
No round two tonight.

87
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,463
-The end.
-Professor.

88
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,464
The end.

89
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,091
I'll take him in.

90
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,676
What complete chaos.

91
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,522
What happened?

92
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,775
It was only a matter of time.

93
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,069
All secrets are bound to be revealed.

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,363
What will you do now?

95
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,908
I'll just be thick-skinned
and act normal like usual.

96
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,828
People who are uncomfortable
can stay that way.

97
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,497
The same goes
for the people who feel troubled.

98
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,498
Not much I can do.

99
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,043
Anyway, can you deal with your dad?

100
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,188
Did you want the patient to die?

101
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,274
I understand maybe
you were too ignorant to notice,

102
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,068
but didn't it seem weird
to prescribe eight ampoules?

103
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,614
You're forbidden from prescribing
on your own without asking someone first.

104
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,575
Make sure to ask
before making proper prescriptions.

105
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,369
-Understood?
-Yes, ma'am.

106
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,871
Dr. Jeon.

107
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,374
Do you have a boyfriend?

108
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,667
I do, why?

109
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,795
-Who is it?
-I'm not going to tell you.

110
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,922
I don't care that you're curious.

111
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,592
I have no reason
to answer questions like that.

112
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,845
Why did you just touch
someone else's things without asking?

113
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,891
It was my mistake
to touch your things without asking.

114
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,392
Don't touch my things from now on.

115
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,145
It's unpleasant.

116
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,363
Father.

117
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,788
-There's a doctor here, right?
-What's wrong?

118
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,215
There's no obstetrician
among the doctors who came here today.

119
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,176
It'd be best to call an ambulance
and go to the nearest OB-GYN.

120
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,802
That would take over an hour.

121
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,264
Hurry up and go wake people up.

122
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,350
Bring the doctors
who haven't been drinking, okay?

123
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,601
-Okay.
-Hurry up and go.

124
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,395
-Please take your wife and follow him.
-Okay.

125
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,899
Honey.

126
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,488
We're almost there.

127
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,949
Hang in there.

128
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,617
-Wake up.
-Hang in there, honey.

129
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,497
Wake up!

130
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,749
My ear hurts.

131
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,836
Pull yourself together
and get ready to deliver a baby.

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,921
Hurry!

133
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,673
A baby?

134
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,468
Please lie down here.

135
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,971
What about the doctor?

136
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,098
I'll bring them right now.

137
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,601
Deep breaths.

138
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,653
Wait. What department are you in?

139
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,447
I'm in rehabilitation medicine.

140
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,157
I'm in ophthalmology.

141
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,159
I'm in…

142
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,120
dentistry.

143
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,791
You told me to bring the people
who hadn't been drinking.

144
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,003
When you were working on the Chuja Islands
as a public health doctor,

145
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,713
you delivered a baby on a boat, right?

146
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,591
That was over 20 years ago.

147
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,219
I have no memory whatsoever
of when I delivered that baby.

148
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,681
Don't you think you'd know better than me?

149
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,058
You're the only one here
that's given birth.

150
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,022
I had a C-section both times.

151
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,440
You're the father.
Shouldn't you know that?

152
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,026
Really?

153
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,071
Excuse me, this isn't
the best time to fight.

154
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,575
First,

155
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,411
we'll need to cut the umbilical cord.

156
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:21,912
So did we…

157
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,456
Did we…

158
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,915
Did we bring a suture set?

159
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,292
Yes, we did.

160
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,376
What else should we get?

161
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,711
What else?

162
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,134
Boil some water.

163
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,388
By the way,

164
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,391
why do we have to boil water
before a baby's birth?

165
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,483
I do have a feeling
that hot water will be needed somehow.

166
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,320
Yes.

167
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,823
Ma'am, how long are the intervals
between your contractions?

168
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,618
I don't know.
The baby is about to come out!

169
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,328
She's been saying that for a while.

170
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,417
I'll take a look.

171
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,090
I'll look.

172
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,053
-I see its head!
-Don't panic. Stay calm.

173
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,430
Ma'am, what's your name?

174
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,724
Baek I-yeon.

175
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,185
Ms. Baek, I'll help you.

176
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:30,106
Don't worry.
Take a deep breath and then push.

177
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,482
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

178
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,858
Push.

179
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,820
-You're doing well.
-There are maneuvers.

180
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,697
The Ritgen's maneuver,
the McRoberts maneuver…

181
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,158
Be quiet, it's already hectic as it is.
Let me focus.

182
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,119
Push again.

183
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,995
Okay, a deep breath in.

184
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,372
-Inhale.
-Inhale.

185
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,166
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

186
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,584
You're doing well.

187
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,920
The head is coming out.

188
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,133
Honey, I don't feel so great…

189
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,384
No, don't go!

190
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,760
You're doing great.

191
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,390
I'll be right back.

192
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,977
Okay, ma'am.

193
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,562
You're doing great.
The head is coming out.

194
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,330
It's 2:20 a.m. on the 17th.

195
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,710
We have a healthy and brave little prince.

196
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,752
Thank you.

197
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,925
Thank you, Doctor.

198
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,010
You did well.

199
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,678
-You did really well.
-Hello.

200
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,138
You did well.

201
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,264
He's beautiful.

202
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,933
Dr. Cha, you did well.

203
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,689
We need to wait
until the placenta comes out.

204
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,816
So hold onto the umbilical cord.

205
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,734
Okay.

206
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,445
Doctor, something is about to come out.

207
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,114
Yes, let's push one more time.

208
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,866
Professor Seo.

209
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,951
What about the hot water?

210
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,082
Use it to clean the baby.

211
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,546
What did he say?

212
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,231
Gosh.

213
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,608
I'm finally sobering up.

214
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,236
You must have had a lot of makgeolli.

215
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,113
Yes.

216
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,243
Right, I heard back at the lodgings
that you did something amazing.

217
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,080
I feel like

218
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,875
I went through many valuable experiences
after coming here.

219
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,631
Professor, thank you for asking me
to come along with you here.

220
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,929
Are you okay?

221
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,683
Everyone found out
that you're married to Professor Seo.

222
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,937
On one hand, I do feel relieved.

223
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,525
I'm sure you've heard about the rumor.

224
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:25,239
Yes, about you and Professor Seo
having an affair

225
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,032
and being in a love triangle with me.

226
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,412
-I don't care about any of that.
-You'll have to now.

227
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,750
Since everyone knows about me
and my husband.

228
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,255
If people keep talking about you
because of me,

229
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,509
it can become embarrassing.

230
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,267
Why aren't you doing anything?

231
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,520
-What?
-About Professor Seo.

232
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,025
Why do you stay silent
despite knowing everything?

233
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,860
Why are you holding back?

234
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,571
How do you know…

235
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,073
about that, Professor?

236
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,660
I don't want to tell you.

237
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,704
Please don't speak lightly

238
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,789
of someone else's family matters.

239
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,458
I'm not speaking lightly of it.

240
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,711
I wanted to tell you several times
but I held back.

241
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,254
But I couldn't stand it anymore.

242
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,845
I'm a mother.

243
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,600
My son works
in the same hospital as his parents.

244
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,519
And my daughter is in high school.

245
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,731
They are facing crucial moments

246
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,069
and I'm choosing to keep the peace
in the family for them.

247
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,987
So…

248
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,406
don't look at me

249
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,451
like I'm some pathetic woman.

250
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,000
It's true that you're pathetic.

251
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,088
Your kids are all grown up.
Please stop sacrificing yourself for them

252
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,298
and choose what makes you happy instead.

253
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,475
It tastes good.

254
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,146
You made it well.

255
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,106
What made you so sick like that?

256
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,609
You only get gastric cramps
when you get stressed.

257
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,492
Eun-seo.

258
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:23,083
I wanted to create a complete family
where a father would be there for you.

259
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,669
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,796
Mom.

261
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,674
Let's be honest.

262
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,762
It's not that I needed a father.
You needed a husband.

263
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,723
Mom…

264
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,975
I'm done letting off steam.

265
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,811
I don't need anything from Dad anymore.

266
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,148
But you still do,
and that's why you're sick.

267
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,650
When will you come to your senses?

268
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,243
Will you really be okay?

269
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:02,081
It'll be just the two of us
in this big world.

270
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,500
Aren't you sad?

271
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,877
There are times when I'm sad.

272
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,046
But…

273
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,714
I'm not unhappy.

274
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,842
I hope you can feel that way too.

275
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,055
I will.

276
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,307
I think I'll be able to.

277
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,816
Everyone, attention please.

278
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:33,153
I apologize for ruining
the team spirit here.

279
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,908
But I think we should get down
to the actual truth before moving on.

280
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,619
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk and Professor Seo In-ho.

281
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,497
Are you two a happily married couple

282
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,209
who are living happily together now
and will continue to do so in the future?

283
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,763
Yes, it's true.

284
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,350
I'm sorry I wasn't able to tell you
this whole time.

285
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,852
This is really crazy.

286
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,395
I told you.

287
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,731
-I'd like to apologize
-What will I do?

288
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,191
to everyone else as well.

289
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,734
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,701
Everyone, be quiet!

291
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,411
She admitted to the fact.

292
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,370
So they're married.

293
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,455
It is what it is.

294
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,750
If things can't be undone,
let's forget about it and move on.

295
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,544
It's the wisest thing we can do
in these modern times.

296
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,297
We're eating seaweed soup
because a new life has been born.

297
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,133
And a new married couple has been born
in our department…

298
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,218
It can count
as a couple being born, right?

299
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,846
I sincerely hope that the two of you
will have a lasting marriage.

300
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,017
And I sincerely hope that everyone here
will join in on my applause.

301
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,232
Eat up.

302
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,780
SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENED!

303
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,115
PROFESSOR SEO AND DR. CHA ARE MARRIED!

304
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,200
SO THEY WERE ACTING ALL ALONG?

305
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,576
SO THEY WERE A THING
NO SECRET LASTS FOREVER

306
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,119
I KNEW IT WAS ODD WHEN DR. CHA COLLAPSED

307
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,913
You're going to sell them all?

308
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,372
Yes.

309
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,958
As fast as you can.

310
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,128
The real estate that your late father
bequeathed to you is quite big,

311
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,421
so it'll take some time.

312
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,758
What are you planning to do after?

313
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,929
I'm going to return to the US.

314
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,810
You drank all that makgeolli.

315
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,188
-Are you okay?
-Dr. Hwang, you're tired, right?

316
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,523
-That was crazy.
-You look really tired.

317
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,860
-You worked hard.
-This is serious. What do I do?

318
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,863
MISSED CALL
EUN-SEO

319
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,378
Sir, one moment!

320
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,463
-Please stop the bus!
-Why?

321
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,809
It's fine.

322
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,310
Gosh.

323
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,524
Slowly.

324
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,443
Gosh. How…

325
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,072
This is garlic that we forgot
to give you yesterday.

326
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,073
Goodness.

327
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,241
And this.

328
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,161
These are potatoes grown
in red clay soil from our field.

329
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,790
The land here is so rich
anything you plant grows to be delicious.

330
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,709
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

331
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,170
Thank you so much.

332
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,007
Come on, it's nothing. Thank you so much.

333
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,174
Wait.

334
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,636
Why are you walking around?
You gave birth yesterday.

335
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,015
We're on our way
to the postnatal care center downtown.

336
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,933
Thank you, Doctor.

337
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,978
It's thanks to you
that I was able to give birth.

338
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,771
You did such a good job.

339
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,651
It's not much, but this is a gift for you.

340
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,904
The flowers on the handkerchief
are apricot blossoms.

341
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,448
They symbolize our wish
for your happiness.

342
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,451
Thank you so much again, Doctor.

343
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,668
Thank you.

344
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,090
Everyone, a round of applause.

345
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,313
We're at the rest stop.
We'll take off again in 30 minutes!

346
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,594
Are you angry at me?

347
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,558
If you were me, wouldn't you feel angry?

348
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,730
I would've been flustered too.

349
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,443
But I would make an effort to understand
why you hid the truth from me.

350
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,907
Are you saying
I'm narrow-minded, unlike you?

351
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,284
Why do you have to twist everything?

352
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,453
Do you expect me to be nice to you then?

353
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:37,541
It's not that. I'm just asking you
to see things from my perspective.

354
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,626
If I had told you,
you would've been so uncomfortable--

355
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,087
Forget it. I don't want
to hear your excuses.

356
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,506
I just…

357
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,847
Jeez, where did she go?

358
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,224
What is he doing over there?

359
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,527
Dr. Cha.

360
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,364
Thank you.

361
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,701
These rest stops are so nice.

362
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,911
They even have a park like this.

363
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,913
I know.

364
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,166
This park is beautiful,

365
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,793
and the weather is so nice.

366
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,089
But all of that feels unfair

367
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,886
when it feels like I'm going through hell.

368
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,308
Dr. Kim.

369
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,894
Thank you for the coffee.

370
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,106
But I think I'll walk on my own for a bit.

371
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,336
Why is this rest stop so big?

372
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,129
I've been looking everywhere for you.

373
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,132
Aren't you hungry?

374
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,884
Have some of this.

375
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,429
Do you not want any?

376
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,187
Why did you do that?

377
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,821
Why did you do it?

378
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:39,704
I was so drunk that all my reason
went right out the window.

379
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,623
I had no idea what I was saying.

380
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,044
It was for the best.
It was tough to keep the secret.

381
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,672
I wouldn't have been able to say it sober.

382
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,591
Will you really be okay?

383
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,928
If we go around
acknowledging that we're married,

384
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,306
will you really be okay with that?

385
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,351
Well…

386
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,646
what can I do when everyone already knows?

387
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,482
Is that so?

388
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,611
That reminds me.

389
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,282
I'm going to work
in Family Medicine starting tomorrow.

390
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,535
I see.

391
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,931
Come in.

392
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,062
I came to say hello.

393
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,356
I'll be working
in Family Medicine starting tomorrow.

394
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,275
I thought you were going to Pediatrics.

395
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,569
Didn't you switch with Dr. Moon?

396
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,572
I was going to, but I changed my mind.

397
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,782
Did you hear?

398
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,493
Everyone in the hospital now knows

399
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,163
that I'm married to In-ho.

400
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,040
He told everyone himself.

401
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,708
I heard.

402
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,209
I look forward to working with you.

403
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,130
Don't concern yourself too much
over the fact that I'm In-ho's wife.

404
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,766
Why did you choose here out of all places?

405
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,393
I heard you came here
on your wife's birthday.

406
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,354
You said you'd come here with me too.

407
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,065
Right.

408
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,903
I overdrank yesterday
so I couldn't pick up Eun-seo's call.

409
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,113
I called her again but she didn't pick up.
Did something happen?

410
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,531
It was nothing.

411
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,703
I heard you revealed
you two are married while you were drunk.

412
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,247
Word gets around fast.

413
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,085
Right, starting tomorrow, my wife--

414
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,211
I know.

415
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,462
She's coming to my department.

416
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,381
Right.

417
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,552
Do you intend…

418
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,722
to get a divorce?

419
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,063
Would you be willing to divorce your wife?

420
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,441
Well…

421
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,112
That's…

422
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,700
You can't do it?

423
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,618
Seung-hi.

424
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,580
Jeong-suk hasn't done anything wrong.

425
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,001
I may be a jerk,
but how can I ask her for a divorce?

426
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,811
I think the time is coming for us
to make a decision.

427
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,566
-Why are you suddenly being like this?
-We can't keep doing this.

428
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,777
This isn't right for everyone involved.

429
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,197
Let's each take some time to think.

430
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,745
That coward.

431
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,213
Hello.

432
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,131
-Hello.
-Yes.

433
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,258
You're doing well. How is your walking?

434
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,135
-It's okay.
-You have to keep moving.

435
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,511
-Okay.
-You must work hard,

436
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,138
that way you'll recover quickly.

437
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,723
-Yes.
-It's better than yesterday, right?

438
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,349
Yes, it seems a little better.

439
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,602
You're doing well. Did you eat?

440
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,901
First-year resident,
have you seen liver surgery before?

441
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,653
Yes, this is my second one.

442
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,238
If you're resecting the right side,

443
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,990
how much of the posterior
should be detached?

444
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,200
Up to the IVC.

445
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,785
Behind the IVC,

446
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,246
there's a firm fibrous structure
holding the liver and IVC in place.

447
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,748
What is it called?

448
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,960
I think it's the ligamentum venosum.

449
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,004
I guess you studied
before you came in here.

450
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,673
But you're wrong.

451
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,927
The correct answer is the IVC ligament.

452
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,223
When you're detaching the IVC,
you need to perform a ligation on this

453
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,266
so that it detaches safely
without bleeding.

454
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,644
"IVC ligament."

455
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,979
Thank you, Professor.

456
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,272
I'll work hard.

457
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,570
Professor.

458
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,241
I have something to ask you.

459
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,242
What is it?

460
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,410
Well…

461
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,122
Ask away. It's fine.

462
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,917
Are you close with Dr. Cha,

463
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,586
I mean, my mother?

464
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,133
I know this may be out of line,
but what's your relationship with her?

465
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,595
I'm curious about

466
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,014
what you think of my mother.

467
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,935
It's a hard question.

468
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,110
Let's just say she's a friend.

469
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,164
Jung-min, what are you doing here?

470
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,669
Father, you have to try harder.

471
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,087
What?

472
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,674
You can't compete.

473
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,927
You're so not on par with him.

474
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:34,976
Can't compete?

475
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,353
Can't compete?

476
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,899
What on earth is he saying?

477
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,109
Fine, do what you want.

478
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,656
Doesn't this square of land look great?

479
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,409
You can't think of it
as a regular convalescent hospital.

480
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,119
The best private retirement complex

481
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,413
and Korean medical clinic
will be built here too.

482
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:59,042
We'll bring in famous doctors
in both Korean and Western medicine

483
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,336
and build a luxurious medical town.

484
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,799
The city of Jugyeong will invest
25 billion won into this facility.

485
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,678
Ms. Kwak, I know
you said you'd invest in this,

486
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,098
but you should let me know
if you have changed your mind.

487
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,683
You have to decide quickly

488
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,811
because there are others waiting in line
who want to invest in this.

489
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,942
The thing is, the building
that I was going to use to take out a loan

490
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,986
is under my daughter-in-law's name.

491
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,906
So I have to consult with my kids.

492
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:33,743
I doubt they will oppose it given that
this project has such positive prospects.

493
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,539
Things like this
need to be taken care of quietly.

494
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,543
The kids won't have anything good to say
when their old folks try to do something.

495
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,839
Is that so?

496
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,969
Don't worry about money
and grill as much meat as you want.

497
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,387
-Okay!
-Okay!

498
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,977
Everyone.

499
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,397
I know this is a farewell party,
but I'd like to say a word.

500
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,566
I'm sorry to all the residents,

501
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,696
and I would like to apologize again
to Chief Yoon and my fellow professors,

502
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,364
who must have been shocked.

503
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,544
I'm very sorry.

504
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,506
I hid it because I thought
it would make everyone uncomfortable,

505
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,925
but I ended up causing you trouble anyway.

506
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,304
Though my dispatch has ended
and I'll be returning to Family Medicine,

507
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,433
I hope you can treat me
as you all did before.

508
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,059
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,103
Okay, let's eat.

510
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,771
Eat up.

511
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,023
That's easier said than done.

512
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,445
But why did you two
sit separately like strangers?

513
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,947
-You should sit together now.
-No, it's fine.

514
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,282
-No.
-It's fine.

515
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,616
Just eat comfortably.

516
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,493
Married couples don't
always have to sit together.

517
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,043
I shall say a word too.

518
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,502
Imagine how much these two

519
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,337
-would want to sit next to each other.
-Exactly.

520
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,673
But they are displaying
self-control and patience.

521
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,135
Everyone knows
you're a family man, Professor Seo.

522
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,928
Even all the patients know.

523
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,182
Dr. Cha, you're also an excellent
resident, a good wife, and a wise mother.

524
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,517
It's your last day in our department.

525
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,687
So for today, you should sit
next to each other and be lovey-dovey.

526
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,774
Make it undeniably obvious
you're a married couple.

527
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,233
Come, sit next to each other.

528
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,030
Come on, stop it.

529
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,448
Go on.

530
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,241
-You should go.
-I will.

531
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,326
I'll be back soon.

532
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,918
Professor Roy,

533
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,879
Please let me pass by.

534
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,384
Professor Seo, come this way.

535
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,428
-Gosh, there?
-Yes.

536
00:34:58,846 --> 00:34:59,722
Thank you.

537
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,727
-I'll pour you a drink.
-You two look like newlyweds.

538
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,022
Two spicy cold noodles, please!

539
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,358
I'm not paying for the noodles.

540
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,818
Let's order some more!

541
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,778
Professor Seo, you should buy them.

542
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,573
Two more servings of sirloin, please.

543
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,505
Do you have anything to say to me?

544
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,508
What could I say?

545
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,929
I doubt anything I say now
will change the way you think about me.

546
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,812
So I just decided to be
as I've always been.

547
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,231
That's a good choice.

548
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,859
I'll do that too.

549
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,969
You don't look like you're in a good mood.

550
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:21,971
You're right.

551
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,973
I'm not in a good mood.

552
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,393
I feel bad

553
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,980
because it feels like I caused that.

554
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,108
Why would you feel bad?

555
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,320
The reason I'm not in a good mood

556
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,573
is because of the patient, Yoo Ji-seon.

557
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,077
Her condition has gotten worse recently.

558
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,121
I see.

559
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,498
I'm sorry.

560
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,417
I'm the one who should be sorry.

561
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,253
I went way too far that day, didn't I?

562
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,090
-Let's drink together.
-Please go ahead.

563
00:36:59,091 --> 00:36:59,926
I'm fine.

564
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,804
-How much alcohol is left?
-Shall I eat it?

565
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,436
Have you eaten some of the meat?

566
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,396
Shall I give you some soju?

567
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,195
Professor Seo, you've grown a lot
seeing as you're pouring your own drink.

568
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,572
Let's have another drink. Give him more.

569
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,159
Let's eat all the food and alcohol
this place has to offer.

570
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,913
I just thought you were too good
to be treated like that.

571
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,583
Professor Seo doesn't deserve you.

572
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm flattered that you think
so highly of me.

573
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:44,220
But I'll find the path
that leads to my happiness on my own.

574
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:52,728
It might be completely different
from what you had in mind,

575
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,399
but there will definitely
be a reason for my choice.

576
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,609
Right now,

577
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,320
all I want to do…

578
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,740
is finish my residency well

579
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,078
and safely overcome these obstacles
that are being thrown at me.

580
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,125
In return, don't forget
that I'm your friend.

581
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,546
If you need someone to lean on,
I'll come running.

582
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,632
No matter where you are.

583
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,391
Once you overcome those obstacles,

584
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,645
an opportunity might come to me too.

585
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,071
Number forty-five.

586
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,658
Professor Seo gets drunk often these days.

587
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,535
He passed out at the medical volunteer…

588
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,372
Jung-min, call a designated driver
and take your father home.

589
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,791
-Okay.
-Wait.

590
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,295
He can go home with Dr. Cha.
Stay together until the very end.

591
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,921
You don't have to go straight home.

592
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,340
No round two tonight.

593
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,591
We'll end things here.

594
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,429
It's great that you live together
in situations like these.

595
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,058
-Don't you think?
-Jung-min, get him up.

596
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,851
His wallet.

597
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,979
-Go with me to the parking lot.
-Okay.

598
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,481
-One, two.
-Three.

599
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,650
Father, please.

600
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,865
How long are you going to stay mad at me?

601
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,744
Can't you just stop?

602
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,454
In the bathroom earlier,

603
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,457
your mom asked
if I had anything to say to her.

604
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:37,875
My mom?

605
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,045
Yes, she probably meant
if I had anything to say

606
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,214
about how rude
I was to her this whole time.

607
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,716
No way. I doubt it.

608
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,177
That's why I told you
to watch what you say.

609
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,347
Why do I have to hear that from you?

610
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,015
Honestly, don't you regret it?

611
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,143
Being so hard on Dr. Cha, I mean, my mom?

612
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,479
Why do I have to look good
in front of your mom?

613
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,398
Did I ever say I wanted to marry you?

614
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,359
That's true.
You never said anything about marriage.

615
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,863
Our relationship doesn't have to conclude
with a marriage like some fairy tale.

616
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:08,906
But you…

617
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,326
Have you ever once thought
about a future with me?

618
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,245
I don't have time for those thoughts.

619
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,125
It's not just you.
Everyone in the hospital has busy lives.

620
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,211
But that doesn't mean
they disregard everything around them.

621
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,963
-Hey.
-I wish

622
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:29,885
you could sometimes look around you
and be kind and compassionate

623
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,471
to those who aren't
as competent as you are.

624
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,726
-Sir, please stop the car.
-What are you doing?

625
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,271
You are a poor judge of character.

626
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,064
You should know

627
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,275
that I'm not that kind of person.

628
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,247
Should we wait for her?

629
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,791
Please just go.

630
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,517
Jeez, why did he drink himself
to senselessness like this?

631
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,395
He never overdrank as he thought
walking drunk was disgraceful.

632
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,397
What on earth happened?

633
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,737
Excuse me, Mother.

634
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,531
I'm sorry,
but can you get me a glass of water?

635
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,782
Sure.

636
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,101
I'm sorry, Seung-hi.

637
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,317
I'm sorry, Jeong-suk.

638
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,238
I'm a jerk.

639
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,617
I'm a jerk.

640
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,705
I deserve to die.

641
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,005
It hurts.

642
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,057
Thank you, Mother.

643
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,143
Jeez, why are you acting like a guest?

644
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,520
I-rang isn't home, right?

645
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,856
She called and said she was going
to stay up in the study room.

646
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,858
Yes, she's working really hard lately.

647
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,694
I'll get going.

648
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,279
It's late. You should sleep here.

649
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,823
No, I have to work early tomorrow.

650
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,616
Okay.

651
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,868
I guess it can't be helped.

652
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,079
-Bye.
-Okay.

653
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,931
CHOI_SEUNGHI

654
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,188
TO MEET, TO KNOW, TO LOVE, AND TO PART
IS A SAD TALE OF MANY A HEART

655
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,458
Who could it be at this hour?

656
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,585
Who is it?

657
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:51,670
Mom, it's me.

658
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,713
What?

659
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,508
-Oh, my.
-Ta-da. Mom, surprise!

660
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,844
Why are you here at this hour?

661
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,929
It's past eleven right now.

662
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,390
What about you?
What were you doing up so late?

663
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,226
Gosh, it's so nice.

664
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,395
Home is the best.

665
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,106
MEDICATED PAIN RELIEF PATCH

666
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,109
Mom, does your shoulder still hurt?

667
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,446
No, it's fine. It's all better.

668
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,781
What do you mean it's fine?

669
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,698
Hey.

670
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,200
I mean it.

671
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,286
Why are you here at this hour
out of the blue?

672
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,621
Is something wrong?

673
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,164
What could be wrong?

674
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,668
I just came to sleep over.

675
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,212
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

676
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,756
I'm telling you, nothing's wrong.

677
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,093
I came here after the group dinner
because I missed you so much.

678
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,387
Goodness.

679
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,140
This takes us back, right?

680
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:47,893
Yes.

681
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,563
You slept like this all the time
before you got married.

682
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,524
Mom.

683
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,567
Yes?

684
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,320
Did you not…

685
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,115
hate Dad?

686
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,619
It's not like he made a lot of money

687
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,206
or treated you really well.

688
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,252
What was so good about him
that you treated him so well

689
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,170
while preparing all his meals for him?

690
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,214
If it were me,

691
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,384
I wouldn't have lived with him.

692
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,767
Not many women in my generation
lived with their husbands out of love.

693
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,395
We just did it because they were
the fathers of our children.

694
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:36,442
I could endure the talk
about me being a widow,

695
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,195
but it was such a devastating thought

696
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,241
to see my child grow up without a father.

697
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:50,080
Your husband isn't important
because he's your husband.

698
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,500
He is important
because he's the father of your children.

699
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,590
I…

700
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,677
would've been okay even if I only had you.

701
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,516
You have a big heart.

702
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,603
Even if In-ho does something wrong,

703
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:16,315
just find it in your heart
to accept it and live with it.

704
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,987
He'll come to appreciate it one day,
when he comes to his senses.

705
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,783
Well, if he doesn't,
there's nothing that can be done.

706
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,267
Why are you here this early?

707
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,188
Did you sleep somewhere else last night?

708
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,398
I slept at my mother's place.

709
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,859
I asked why you are here.

710
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,614
I brought a coffee machine for you.
You like coffee.

711
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,492
I brought a lot of capsules too. Here.

712
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,333
Are you eating well?

713
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,545
I'll take care of myself.

714
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,966
Why are you acting like you care
all of a sudden?

715
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,846
It feels weird that you're not home.

716
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,685
Come back home
once you get used to your job

717
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,729
since it's okay for us
to commute together now.

718
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,527
Can I come in for a moment?

719
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,822
-No.
-I'll go then.

720
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:32,451
I will end my presentation
on the conference case for osteomyelitis.

721
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,202
Are there any questions?

722
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,830
What needs to be used
if it's shown to be an MRSA?

723
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:38,832
Well…

724
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,377
We would need to check
the susceptibility test results…

725
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:43,962
I mean,

726
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,798
we would use vancomycin.

727
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:50,469
If needed, you could continually check
the TDM and use vancomycin

728
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,763
or use teicoplanin.

729
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,140
Yes.

730
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,185
Thank you.

731
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:03,899
We're all done here.

732
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,443
Prepare her admittance forms

733
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,487
and a consultation
with the Gastroenterology Department.

734
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,740
Basic blood tests show weight loss,

735
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,659
so what other tests
should be ordered for the patient?

736
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:20,499
The formation of tumor markers
and diabetes could lead to weight loss.

737
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,377
So I'll add an hbA1c test.

738
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,630
Yes, it could also be
due to an organ issue.

739
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,840
It's common with hyperthyroidism as well.

740
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:33,303
So run TFT, ANA, and RF
to see if she has any autoimmune diseases.

741
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,015
Okay.

742
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:43,230
My father-in-law can't sleep,
has no appetite, and is depressed.

743
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,815
He's lost a lot of weight too.

744
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,024
I see.

745
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,901
In this case, what would you prescribe?

746
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,281
Trazodone or zolpidem.

747
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:57,577
In this case, if mirtazapine is taken,
the depression symptoms get better quickly

748
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,623
and it'll help him gain weight
as it'll increase his sleep and appetite.

749
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,230
Why are you still coming here?

750
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,565
I told you to move academies.

751
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,983
Do I have to listen to you?

752
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,193
Just keep coming here too.

753
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,362
We're in 12th grade, so we need to focus.

754
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,072
"We"?

755
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,657
Is shamelessness genetic too?

756
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,325
What'll you do for me
if I move to a different one?

757
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,162
Are you going to give me

758
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:41,955
your dad?

759
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,838
You crazy brat!

760
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,311
Don't mess with me again.

761
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,995
MY DAUGHTER
I'LL BE HAVING DINNER WITH A FRIEND, MOM

762
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,748
LET'S HAVE DINNER SOME OTHER TIME
SORRY

763
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,293
-Dr. Cha.
-Director.

764
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,341
-Are you finding the work here manageable?
-Yes.

765
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:38,011
Chairman Oh still calls me these days
and asks how you're doing.

766
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,182
He's checking to see if you didn't quit
and are still working here.

767
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,643
Please keep up the good work.

768
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,560
Okay.

769
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,645
I'll get going now.

770
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,307
Welcome.

771
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,185
I'm sorry,
but can you please follow that car?

772
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,144
Okay.

773
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,752
Sir, please just stop the car.

774
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,506
You need to see things to the end
to be able to start anew.

775
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,169
What on earth happened?

776
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,712
It's nothing.

777
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,672
If it's nothing, why are you in a cast?

778
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:41,051
It's not as if you are a little kid.
How did you hurt yourself?

779
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,511
Why are you staying silent?

780
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,680
Right.

781
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:49,100
You're lucky it isn't worse.
But how did this happen?

782
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,268
I'm your dad. Tell me.

783
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,854
If I tell you,
you'll be in a difficult position.

784
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,981
Will you be okay with that?

785
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,068
Seo I-rang did this to me.

786
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,345
Aren't you going in?

787
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,601
I said, aren't you going in?

788
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,021
I'm not.

789
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,399
Is something wrong?

790
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,985
If I go inside,

791
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,322
I don't think I'll be able to breathe.

792
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,033
Still,

793
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,327
you should go in.

794
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,662
It's a cold night.

795
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,871
Get in.

796
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,671
You seem to feel suffocated.
Let's go on a drive.

797
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,140
Do you still feel suffocated?

798
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:17,350
Yes.

799
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,946
What are you doing?

800
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,658
I thought you said you couldn't breathe.
I bought this car for times like these.

801
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,956
You're right.

802
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,668
I feel like I can breathe

803
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,005
with the air hitting my face like this.

804
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,089
What?

805
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,049
I feel like I can breathe!

806
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,222
Something's wrong,

807
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:57,974
isn't it?

808
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,643
Yes.

809
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:02,854
Something's wrong

810
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,273
but I can't even believe it

811
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,026
because it feels too unreal.

812
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,531
I think I know what it is.

813
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,492
No.

814
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,244
You really don't know.

815
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,872
I think I know what it is!

816
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,215
You want to kill those two bastards.

817
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,275
Professor Seo is cheating on you!

818
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,199
It's raining.

819
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,077
Hurry up and close it.

820
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,037
My goodness!

821
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,997
-Why isn't it working?
-Please do something!

822
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,082
I'm trying!

823
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,084
You can't even close
the roof of your own car?

824
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,752
I opened it for the first time today!

825
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,297
What do we do?

826
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,715
It's cold!

827
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,219
My goodness!

828
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,063
This isn't the time to be laughing!

829
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,109
It's cold!

830
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,788
Come on, stop laughing!

831
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,649
DOCTOR CHA

832
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,005
Come here right now.

833
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:37,091
Unless you want the whole hospital
to be talking about your affair.

834
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,093
Why did you make a fool out of me
when the whole family already knew?

835
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,511
Why was I the only one who didn't know?

836
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,806
Do we really need to break up?
Don't you think she'll divorce you soon?

837
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,142
I'll quit if you get a divorce.

838
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,894
Get out of my sight.

839
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,730
A short circuit must have
caused a fire in the dorms.

840
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,315
Dr. Cha!

841
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,525
Open the door right now!

842
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:01,783
