00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,926
DOCTOR CHA

2
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,919
Make your choice.

3
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,506
Between the two of us,
whose liver will you accept?

4
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,300
Decide right here, right now!

5
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,761
Make your decision, Dr. Cha.

6
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,642
I'm not sure.

7
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,438
Whose liver should I accept?

8
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,841
I choose…

9
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,076
I want to ride this one.

10
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,579
Would that be all right?

11
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,622
Yes.

12
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,707
Of course.

13
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,375
Are you joking right now?

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,460
Also, I'm not going to accept…

15
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,298
either of your livers.

16
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,384
I'm not going to accept anyone's liver.

17
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,762
I'll figure this out on my own,
so both of you should stop now.

18
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,930
Okay?

19
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,641
And you can leave.

20
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,352
You want me to go now?

21
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,147
-Then what will you do?
-Me?

22
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,774
Can't you tell?

23
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,823
Then shall we go?

24
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,283
Yes, let's go.

25
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,043
Hold on to him tight!

26
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,377
What am I saying?

27
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,059
Next time, you should be the driver.

28
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,060
Me?

29
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,651
I do wonder
what it'd be like to drive this.

30
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,779
I'm going to go fast. Hold on tight!

31
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,155
Okay!

32
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,914
FINALE

33
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,500
CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL

34
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,011
Hanseong Medical Corporation said
they're willing to take over.

35
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,056
The amount they proposed is decent,
but it's still a shame.

36
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,350
The facilities and equipment here

37
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,727
are better than other hospitals
of a similar scale.

38
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,647
Above all else, the medical staff here
are earnest and devoted.

39
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,400
Hello.

40
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,443
Hello.

41
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,861
You've done great.

42
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:40,905
It's so nice.

43
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,700
What kinds of patients
generally come here?

44
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,120
Some people come here
after cancer surgery before going home.

45
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,747
This place also acts as a hospice

46
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,583
for terminal cancer patients
in managing their pain.

47
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,337
Maybe it's because your father,
the chairman, also suffered from cancer,

48
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,966
but he took special care
in establishing this hospital.

49
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,970
He invested generously in the facilities
and the personnel.

50
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,140
Should I proceed with the contract?

51
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,063
Why don't I take over this hospital?

52
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,899
I have a feeling I'd do a good job.

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,111
I want to give it a shot.

54
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,613
You might have already suspected this,

55
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,242
but the steroid pulse therapy
isn't having much of an effect.

56
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,286
I think

57
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,122
it's proceeding to acute liver failure.

58
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,584
You'll need another liver transplant.

59
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,338
A deceased liver donor
may show up in time,

60
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,799
but otherwise,
you'll need to receive the liver

61
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,093
of a living donor as fast as possible.

62
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,554
I guess so.

63
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,183
This isn't some stranger's business.

64
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,729
I can't help but laugh.

65
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,315
Honestly,

66
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,151
it feels like a dream
that something like this…

67
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,738
to happen again.

68
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,324
I'm telling you this again,

69
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,951
but all of my immunological tests
including my blood type

70
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,369
show that I'm a good match.

71
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,248
When I ran a simulation, the liver volume
that I can donate was good,

72
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,586
and there was no anatomical variation,
so there won't be any problem.

73
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,129
Not this again.

74
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,465
Professor Kim,

75
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,133
you're quite stubborn.

76
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,427
I am, so please change your mind.

77
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,678
Please give me

78
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,306
the chance to save your life.

79
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,103
Professor Kim,

80
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,188
I have a favor to ask.

81
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,149
Can I…

82
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,152
leave the hospital just for today?

83
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,086
It's nice to see you here,
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk.

84
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,304
I have to go back to the hospital.

85
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,267
I was allowed to leave the hospital
for a little bit today.

86
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,187
Do I look really bad?

87
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,605
What do you mean?

88
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,649
You look perfectly fine
with that makeup on.

89
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,403
So you need…

90
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,530
another liver transplant?

91
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,907
Yes.

92
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,703
But I'm not sure
if that's the right thing to do.

93
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,205
What do you mean?
You have to do it to live.

94
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,999
Even if I do get another transplant,

95
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,002
who's to say this won't happen again?

96
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,881
I'm scared I'll be causing
unnecessary suffering for someone

97
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,259
because of me.

98
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,598
How is your mother?

99
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,516
She's really worried, right?

100
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,060
"Really worried" doesn't cut it.

101
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,605
She says she should be the one dying,

102
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,440
but somehow things got reversed.

103
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:10,406
I think she thinks that
I got sick because she got better.

104
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,535
That she took away all my luck.

105
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,079
That's ridiculous!

106
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,414
It is ridiculous.

107
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,374
It's ridiculous.

108
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,377
No matter how many times
I say it's not true,

109
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,088
she can't seem to get that thought
out of her head.

110
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,133
She rarely comes to the hospital.

111
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,597
I guess it's too difficult for her
to see me sick.

112
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,900
Smile.

113
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,584
SCOOP OUT THE AVOCADO
AND PUT IT IN A LARGE BOWL

114
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,206
TO JUNG-MIN AND I-RANG,
WHOM I LOVE THE MOST IN THE WORLD

115
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,000
Dear Jung-min

116
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,877
and I-rang.

117
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,506
You're not shocked
that I wrote a letter like this, right?

118
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,555
I looked at your baby photos today.

119
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,769
You were so small and pretty that
I was so scared to hold you in my arms.

120
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,938
When did you two grow to be this big?

121
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,615
I hope that both of you become wise people

122
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,077
who know how to find happiness
in everyday life.

123
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,332
I hope that you eat what you want
and do the things you want to do,

124
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,462
then fall asleep happy
and wake up refreshed.

125
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,173
Jung-min,

126
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,467
I-rang,

127
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,136
Even though

128
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,764
I may not be by your side one day,

129
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,060
I'll always protect you.

130
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,146
And…

131
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,734
thank you for being my son and daughter.

132
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,236
I LOVE YOU

133
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,322
I love you so much
that it can't be expressed

134
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,741
in words.

135
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,660
Love, your mom.

136
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,898
Mom!

137
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,399
What? I-rang.

138
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,902
What happened? What are you doing here?

139
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,197
I was able to leave for a bit,
but I have to go back soon.

140
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,369
I wish you could always
be home like before.

141
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,246
I know.

142
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,457
Jeong-suk, what are you doing here?

143
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,293
Why are you here and not at the hospital?

144
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,587
Mother, have you been well?

145
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,755
Yes.

146
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,841
She came out for a bit
but has to go back to the hospital.

147
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,308
I heard you went to see Eun-seo's mom.

148
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,068
She said you should go
to the school you want.

149
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,197
And that you should live
without that guilt.

150
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,741
-Really?
-Yes.

151
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,913
I know you did it because you were angry.

152
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,040
But I-rang,

153
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm not…

154
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,628
as unhappy as you think I am.

155
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,756
Getting married to your dad

156
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,759
and raising you and Jung-min

157
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,553
has given me

158
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,139
many more happy memories than sad ones.

159
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,226
I know you've had a hard time too.

160
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,021
But I hope…

161
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:02,109
that what's happened
doesn't hurt you anymore.

162
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,488
-Okay?
-Okay.

163
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,901
DIVORCE APPLICATION
(APPOINTMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS)

164
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,404
HUSBAND: SEO IN-HO

165
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,997
Mother, I'll get going now.

166
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,124
Is your treatment going well?

167
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,918
It's all right.

168
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,670
Don't think about anything else

169
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,338
and focus on getting better.

170
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,048
Okay, Mother.

171
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,842
I hope you stay well too.

172
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,098
I really don't understand you.

173
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,643
You should've led an easygoing life
after you had gotten a liver transplant.

174
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,688
Why would you mess with your fate
and get sick again?

175
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,984
If your husband begs for forgiveness,

176
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,945
you should accept it.

177
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,782
Do you think getting a divorce
will make things better?

178
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,493
I'm sorry, Mother,

179
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,580
that I couldn't be
a good daughter-in-law to the very end.

180
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,297
Mother, I'll be back
after talking to Jeong-suk.

181
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,265
Goodbye, Mother. Stay well.

182
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,316
Why would she come home
after leaving this house?

183
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,112
How stubborn. She doesn't know
how good it is to have a husband.

184
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,257
She insists on making people cry
to the very end.

185
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,641
Didn't the real estate agent call you?

186
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,061
I heard someone came to look.

187
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,353
I said I wasn't going to sell it.

188
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,273
Just keep it.

189
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,108
You…

190
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,360
have the right to keep it.

191
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,950
You said your mother had debt.

192
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,202
Forget about it.

193
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,745
I'll figure it out,

194
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,163
so don't bring it up again.

195
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,668
It's the divorce papers.

196
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,339
You don't want to accept my liver

197
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,092
because you don't want to be
at a disadvantage to me.

198
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,761
If I go through with the surgery

199
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,764
and then pathetically
beg you to forgive me,

200
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,225
then you won't be able to reject me

201
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,644
since you're so soft-hearted.

202
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,523
That's why I brought this.

203
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,194
I'll let you go through with the divorce
and I won't pathetically cling to you.

204
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,779
So get the surgery.

205
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,115
And live.

206
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,243
Allow me to repent

207
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,870
for my sins through this.

208
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,373
I'm scared…

209
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,043
that I'll never be able

210
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,004
to see you again.

211
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,508
Even if we break up,

212
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,219
I still want to see you sometimes…

213
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,934
as the mother of my children.

214
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,376
I heard you're getting the surgery.

215
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,629
Yes.

216
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,840
You made the right choice.

217
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,927
I'm quitting the hospital.

218
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,140
Are you going to the US?

219
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,099
No.

220
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm going to run a hospital.

221
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,104
I think I'll do a good job.

222
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,150
And it just seems like where I should be.

223
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,736
So that's what I decided to do.

224
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,321
Okay.

225
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,240
That's great. You'll do a great job.

226
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,409
Have a good surgery.

227
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,704
I hope that both of you stay healthy.

228
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,042
We're…

229
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,669
breaking up, right?

230
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,463
Yes.

231
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,422
Let's meet

232
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,174
sometimes.

233
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,800
We have Eun-seo.

234
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,634
You're Eun-seo, right?

235
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,261
Yes.

236
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,643
I came to meet my mom.
Today is her last day.

237
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,311
I see.

238
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,021
How's your arm?

239
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,815
Is it fully healed?

240
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,650
Almost.

241
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,987
But are you sick?

242
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,946
Yes.

243
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,614
A little.

244
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,827
I sat here
because I have something to tell you.

245
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,246
Do you have a moment?

246
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,584
I don't know when you found out,

247
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,755
but all of us adults are to blame

248
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,675
for every single situation
you've found yourself in.

249
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,178
None of it was ever your fault.

250
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,347
Just remember that.

251
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,435
So put the bad things behind you
and enjoy life.

252
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,980
Don't walk on eggshells around anyone
or feel discouraged.

253
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,774
And…

254
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,985
don't hate your mom too much.

255
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,198
Okay?

256
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,667
RESIDENT MOON CHEA-YOON

257
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,670
Professor, please come
to the medical office now!

258
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,215
What's wrong?

259
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,636
Thank you for everything.

260
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,679
Professor Choi.

261
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,682
You all must be busy. You shouldn't have.

262
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,933
We heard you're quitting.

263
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,562
I'm hurt that you were just going to leave
without saying goodbye.

264
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,688
I'm sorry.

265
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,774
Thank you, Professor Choi.

266
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,320
-Thank you for everything.
-Thank you for everything.

267
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,530
-We're going to miss you.
-Thank you, Professor Choi.

268
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,948
Please don't go.

269
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,285
We don't want you to.

270
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,622
Professor Roy doesn't have some kind
of get-together today, right?

271
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,874
It'd be disrespectful if he drinks

272
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,710
the night before operating on
a special VIP patient like me.

273
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,714
He's been going on frequent business trips
for conferences and whatnot lately.

274
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,758
But a surgeon should focus
on his surgeries

275
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,802
and not waste his energy
on trivial things.

276
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,011
Are you going to keep eating that?

277
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,181
No. I'm sorry.

278
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,268
He doesn't have any conferences
or other plans today.

279
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,773
You prepared the stapler and thread

280
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,316
-that Professor Roy uses a lot, right?
-Yes.

281
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,820
We can't have him blame the instruments
if the surgery goes wrong.

282
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,656
So tell all the vendors to be
on standby with their products.

283
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,242
And film my surgery from start to end.

284
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,702
-I'm going to check it afterward.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,037
Who's coming into the surgery?

286
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,789
-Chief Resident Hwang, will you be there?
-Yes.

287
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,416
Do a once-over of your textbook
before you come in, okay?

288
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,461
Dr. Jeon, since you're good at suturing,
you should come too.

289
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,463
We're doing a laparoscopy, right?

290
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,341
Professor Seo, don't worry so much.

291
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,218
You already told us all of this yesterday.

292
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,637
All the best residents will be going in.

293
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,098
We've already done
multiple liver volume renderings,

294
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,642
so we're familiar with your liver anatomy.

295
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,061
We also checked the right side
of your liver that'll be extracted.

296
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,189
Just in case it hurts a lot
after the surgery,

297
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,067
we've prepared
a hypodermic injection device as well.

298
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,779
Good job.

299
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,575
This is her second surgery,
so there'll be a lot of adhesions.

300
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,245
Since there was a transplant rejection,
detaching the liver won't be easy.

301
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,289
There won't be an issue, right?

302
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,791
The team in charge
ran multiple simulations.

303
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,003
All the relevant departments
have double-checked,

304
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,338
so the teamwork will be top-notch.

305
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,339
Okay.

306
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,222
I trust you'll do well

307
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,641
on my surgery today, Professor.

308
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,396
My life is once again in your hands.

309
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,608
I put too much pressure on you, didn't I?

310
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,779
I'll do my very best.

311
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,823
It's a cliché thing to say,

312
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,535
but I can't think of anything better.

313
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,288
I'll do a good job.

314
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,998
So don't worry too much.

315
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:01,917
Okay.

316
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,942
Hello, Professor Seo.

317
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,318
-Hello, Professor Seo.
-Hello, Professor Seo.

318
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,319
Hello.

319
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,614
Hey, Jung-man, Dong-u,
Hye-min, and Ye-seo.

320
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,782
Let's do a good job.

321
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,492
-Yes, Professor Seo.
-Okay.

322
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,370
Chief Resident Hwang.

323
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,623
-Mi-la, I'm counting on you.
-Don't worry, Professor.

324
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,338
A little more.

325
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,382
-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Hello.

326
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,636
-You're nervous, right?
-Well…

327
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,805
A little.

328
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,766
You should relax
and put your mind at ease.

329
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,601
Okay.

330
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,603
When you're doing the surgery,

331
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,524
remove the biggest piece
of my liver that you can

332
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,151
and give it to my wife.

333
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,695
I was already planning to do that.

334
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,701
But you don't have to be
so determined and remove a lot, right?

335
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,077
Let's get started.

336
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,540
Administering the anesthesia.

337
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,962
I know you'll remove it well,

338
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,798
but consider the safety of the donor…

339
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,728
I'm just going to remove
the damaged liver,

340
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,897
and the rest of the transplant
will be handled by Professor Roy.

341
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,024
You're aware of this, right?

342
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,900
Yes, of course.

343
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,402
You must be well aware of this,

344
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,739
but this is your second transplant
and the adhesions will be severe,

345
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,950
so the surgery time will be long,
and there can be a lot of bleeding.

346
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,413
But the country's best transplant team
will be working on this,

347
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:07,250
so relax and leave everything to us.

348
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,127
Yes, I will.

349
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,587
You've got this.

350
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,840
Then I will administer the anesthesia now.

351
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,179
Relax and take a slow, deep breath in.

352
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,847
The medicine is going in.

353
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,961
Let's do a time-out.

354
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,131
Patient number 769865, Mr. Seo In-ho.

355
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,718
He is a liver donor undergoing
a right hemihepatectomy surgery.

356
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,012
Let's begin.

357
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,363
You must be feeling very upset.

358
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,198
It goes beyond that.

359
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,991
I'm in agony.

360
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,785
It's not just agony.

361
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,621
I feel like I'm dying.

362
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,666
He should've just given the liver
from the get-go.

363
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,086
But I never knew my son
would be a guy crazy enough

364
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,255
to give his liver

365
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,465
to the wife he's divorcing.

366
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,301
Don't be too upset.

367
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:45,181
She's still the mother of his children,
and she was a good daughter-in-law.

368
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,600
I know.

369
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,728
Ms. Oh,

370
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,356
is Jeong-suk really going to go through
with the divorce?

371
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,050
Suture, please.

372
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,021
Professor.

373
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,497
OPERATING ROOM 1

374
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,707
PATIENT NAME: CHA JEONG-SUK
SURGEON: ROY KIM

375
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,502
Mr. Seo In-ho.

376
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,462
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk.

377
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,297
Are you both present?

378
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,924
Yes.

379
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,467
Yes.

380
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,137
Is it true that you both intend
to get a divorce?

381
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,472
Yes.

382
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,017
PRESIDING JUDGE

383
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,187
PARTY

384
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:15,939
Yes.

385
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,901
You've both agreed to child custody rights
and division of assets, correct?

386
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,860
Yes.

387
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,778
Yes.

388
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,327
That was anticlimactic.

389
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,538
Right?

390
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,167
I heard some people throw
rowdy divorce ceremonies.

391
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,212
Now that I think about it…

392
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,632
I think I understand why.

393
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,302
You didn't eat lunch, right?

394
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,098
No.

395
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,643
Let's eat something here.

396
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,119
How long has it been
since just the two of us ate together?

397
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,666
Was it around when Jung-min
graduated middle school?

398
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,335
You know, when your uncle passed away

399
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,713
and we had beef short-rib soup
on the way back from Cheongju.

400
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,382
Was that the last time?

401
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,260
That's ridiculous. That was ages ago.

402
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,220
I'm telling you.

403
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,932
I don't have a memory of just us two
eating out after that.

404
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,730
Come on, that's not right.

405
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,356
I'm telling you, I'm right.

406
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,319
What's the point
when things ended up like this?

407
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,487
Memories of us

408
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,657
eating together as two close people

409
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,076
are so far in the past.

410
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,330
It's only after we broke up

411
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,999
that we're having a meal,
just the two of us.

412
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,341
That reminds me.

413
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,134
I heard you became the hospital director!

414
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,094
Congratulations.

415
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,473
Your mother must be thrilled, right?

416
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,436
Well, they say I'm the youngest director
in the hospital's history.

417
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,774
It's tiring because people
keep giving me unpleasant looks,

418
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,485
but I'll still try my best
in my new position.

419
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,249
Thank you for the lunch.

420
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,167
It's nothing.

421
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,545
-Will you return to the hospital?
-Yes.

422
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,798
Thankfully, they said
they'll take me back.

423
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:51,386
But I'm not going to push myself too hard
and I will start again after getting rest.

424
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,179
If you hadn't met me,

425
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,266
you would've settled into your career
so much faster.

426
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,394
I'm sorry.

427
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,355
And thank you for everything.

428
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,858
You were perfect as both my wife

429
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,529
and the mother of my children.

430
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,491
Not…

431
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,953
all of it was bad for me.

432
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,082
I have a lot of good memories.

433
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,044
I wish you the best.

434
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,921
Should we…

435
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,756
shake hands?

436
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,887
THE YOUNGEST HOSPITAL DIRECTOR

437
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,103
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
SEO IN-HO

438
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,035
This place is huge!

439
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,703
Look at this place!

440
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,038
I've never been to a place like this.

441
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,874
Honey! Kids, your dad has made it!

442
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,044
Honey, you're so amazing!

443
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,088
Does this mean
I'll get a bigger allowance?

444
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,255
Awesome.

445
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,550
-Dad, pass this down to me.
-Give it to me too.

446
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,553
-Honey, congratulations.
-Dad.

447
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,806
-You're the best!
-Amazing!

448
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,525
-So amazing.
-Dad is the best.

449
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,193
You're really amazing.

450
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,361
I respect you, Father.

451
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,359
It's been a while.

452
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,069
I heard you got into a school.

453
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,488
A friend at the academy told me.

454
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,115
Yes.

455
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,033
I'm preparing for regular admissions.

456
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,161
If I fail, I can go study abroad.

457
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,580
I'm sorry about last time.

458
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,585
I approached you
knowing you were my dad's daughter.

459
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,296
I'm the one who started things.

460
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,339
I'm going to go.

461
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,594
My mom and dad…

462
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,596
got divorced.

463
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,118
Undersecretary, let me show you
the Surgery Department

464
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,620
of Gusan University Hospital.

465
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,122
Our Surgery Department
is the first in the country

466
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,540
to have the latest robotic surgical--

467
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,167
Director.

468
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,587
The undersecretary came for
the specialized infectious disease ward.

469
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,172
You should show him
to Internal Medicine first.

470
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,509
-Not to the Surgical Department.
-Of course, please.

471
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,679
This way.

472
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,597
Let's go.

473
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,607
Hey, Eun-seo.

474
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,733
How are you?

475
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,777
I've been just okay.

476
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,654
Are you busy?

477
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,866
I have an important guest right now…

478
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,910
But it's fine. You can talk.

479
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,662
Do you have time today?

480
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,080
Today?

481
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,923
I'm sorry I haven't
contacted you at all lately.

482
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,300
My mind was all over the place.

483
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,011
I know.

484
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,971
I see.

485
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,557
Eun-seo, I…

486
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,353
No.

487
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,688
As your dad…

488
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,899
I'm lacking in many ways.

489
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,027
It won't be easy, but going forward,

490
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,029
I'll try to be…

491
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,533
a good dad to you.

492
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,661
Can you wait for me one more time?

493
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,204
Okay.

494
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,498
Okay, thank you.

495
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,667
Thank you.

496
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,091
Is there something on my face?

497
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,387
You must have
some irresistible charm that I can't see.

498
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,346
What?

499
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,807
It's just that my mom and that lady

500
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,768
seem a bit too good for you.

501
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,648
I guess I did an exceptionally good deed
in my past life.

502
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,859
I heard you got divorced.

503
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,361
How did you know?

504
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,613
What are you going to do about Mom?

505
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,118
Your mom and I…

506
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,415
already decided to end things as well.

507
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,334
You shouldn't let her go.

508
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,128
Sorry.

509
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,756
It would be too shameless to do that.

510
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,632
You've done worse things, so why not?

511
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,469
You have to try
and cling to Mom at least once

512
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,304
to make things fair.

513
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,615
-What is that?
-The promotional video for the hospital.

514
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,824
Is the hospital doing well?

515
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,660
Rather than saying it's doing well,

516
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,330
it's more like I'm doing a good job.

517
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,381
Dad got divorced.

518
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:44,882
What?

519
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,951
It's been a while.

520
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,787
It has.

521
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,375
How's your hospital doing?

522
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,127
It's going well.

523
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,753
How have you been?

524
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,839
It's always the same for me.

525
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,299
How are you feeling?

526
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,054
I'm almost fully recovered.
My liver has almost fully regrown.

527
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,722
That's a relief.

528
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,271
I came to see
if we can sign an MOU with this hospital

529
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,730
to become an affiliated hospital.

530
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,650
Sure, that would be needed.

531
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,156
Jeong-suk and I got a divorce.

532
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,868
You must feel terrible.

533
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,078
But just like you said,
I did everything I can,

534
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,455
so I just have to accept it.

535
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,332
Honestly, I deserve to be divorced.

536
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,335
I contributed to your divorce too.

537
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,757
You have to try
and cling to Mom at least once

538
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,468
to make things fair.

539
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,728
You saved my life twice.

540
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,315
I'll really take care
of my health this time

541
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,526
and make sure we never meet
in an operating room again.

542
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,528
I'm happy to hear that.

543
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,572
What happened…

544
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,741
with your father?

545
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,951
I donated my bone marrow.

546
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,079
Not as his son, but as a doctor.

547
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,790
If it's a decision
you won't come to regret,

548
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,126
then that's enough.

549
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,880
I now think of my parents in the US,

550
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,342
who raised me unconditionally,
as my true parents.

551
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,845
I realized it so late like a fool.

552
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,723
Professor Kim.

553
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,142
Thank you so much.

554
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,521
For performing surgery on me so well,

555
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,690
and for offering
to donate your liver to me.

556
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,651
I'll never forget that

557
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,904
for the rest of my life.

558
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,157
You'll really never forget?

559
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,408
Of course.

560
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,786
There is one way you'll never forget.

561
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,331
You can have me by your side forever.

562
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,752
Actually,

563
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,214
I like you, Dr. Cha.

564
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,968
I've wanted to say this for a long time,

565
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,053
but I'm only managing to now.

566
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,144
Thank you.

567
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,898
Those words are like…

568
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,444
a beautifully bright ray

569
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,905
of spring sunshine.

570
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,366
But…

571
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,286
as for me,

572
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,497
I think I'm too tired now to live my life

573
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,000
only relying on that ray of sunshine.

574
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,296
What's precious to me now

575
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,673
is mundane, everyday life.

576
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,722
Rather than someone like me,

577
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,850
I think that you should meet someone

578
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,561
who is well suited for you
in every single way.

579
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,688
You should get married,

580
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,857
enjoy newlywed life…

581
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,028
have a kid or two,

582
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,363
and live a busy life…

583
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,745
as you grow old together.

584
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,707
You…

585
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,336
may think I'm old-fashioned,

586
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,672
but that's how I feel.

587
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,039
The freesias are so pretty, right?

588
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,291
I like them a lot.

589
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,794
They're quite popular
as they have a good meaning behind them.

590
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,296
"I support your new beginning."

591
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,801
I didn't know
that was the meaning behind freesias.

592
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,637
That's why they're popular for graduations
and entrance ceremonies.

593
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,515
I'll buy some freesias.

594
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,909
-Hello.
-How can I help you?

595
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,787
Can I have a pregnancy test?

596
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,288
One moment.

597
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,625

600
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:37,901
You passed.

601
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,739
And I thought you had zero motor skills!

602
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,616
But you're quite amazing.

603
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,786
What are you talking about?
I have amazing spatial perception.

604
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,165
Don't you have to leave?

605
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,375
I do. It's a busy time.

606
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,756
-Hello.
-Hi.

607
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,975
Hello.

608
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,102
Yeong-ho, I'll do that
so you take the orders.

609
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,270
Hello.

610
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,105
NEW ORDER

611
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,209
Here is your blueberry chicory salad.

612
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:41,131
Chicory has a lot of dietary fiber that
prevents your blood sugar from spiking.

613
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,760
It also reduces the absorption of glucose,
so it's very good for diabetes.

614
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,346
Enjoy and stay healthy.

615
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,472
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

616
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,556
Let's eat.

617
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,770
Dr. Cha, it's time for you
to see patients.

618
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,063
-Okay, I'll go.
-Okay.

Thoracic outlet syndrome?

624
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,639
Yes, there's a triangular space
in our body that's formed by our ribs,

625
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,351
collarbone, and shoulder blades.

626
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:39,273
Pain can form when the nerves
and blood vessels here are pushed down.

627
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:45,445
Degenerative conditions can form
in our neck or shoulders as we get older,

628
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,698
which also cause pain
like what you're going through.

629
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,242
You're right.
It hurts everywhere now that I'm old.

630
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,829
First, let's take an X-ray
and see what the issue is.

631
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:57,332
If your daily life is still difficult
even after taking medicine,

632
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,084
then you should go to a bigger hospital

633
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,295
and get a thorough medical checkup.

634
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,132
But I think it'd be good to always sit
with the correct posture.

635
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,301
-Straighten out your shoulders.
-Yes.

636
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,262
You have to make a constant effort
to sit up straight.

637
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,056
And don't look
at your cell phone too often.

638
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,766
You should never lift heavy things.

639
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,809
This is bad.

640
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,102
I have to make kimchi tomorrow.

641
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,979
Goodness, no.

642
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,690
Tell your husband and kids
to lift the heavy things for you.

643
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,066
Gosh, I should do that.

644
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,151
-Yes.
-I should.

645
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,904
This place sells healthy salads

646
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,074
and you listen
to all your patients with such care.

647
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,743
I'm so thrilled that a place like this

648
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,120
-opened up in the neighborhood.
-Really?

649
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:39,416
And I even found a magazine article
that said this is a unique clinic.

650
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,126
You saw that?
Did my picture come out great?

651
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:45,339
-Gosh, you're our neighborhood star.
-Me?

652
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,603
-Mom.
-Hey.

653
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,315
Did you pass?

654
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,360
Of course, I passed.

655
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,736
I'm your daughter, after all.

656
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,616
It'd be nice if you didn't ride
a motorcycle given how dangerous it is.

657
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,119
Come on, I just got the license.
I don't know if I'll ride one or not.

658
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,663
Sure, think thoroughly about it.

659
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:21,917
I'm already getting anxious
at the thought of you riding motorcycles.

660
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:27,172
But Mom, as I was coming in
and saw you taking care of the garden,

661
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,884
I thought all of this was so picturesque.

662
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:31,885
This is wonderful.

663
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,974
I feel like I'm living in a dream too.

664
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,478
When you received your second surgery,

665
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,397
I really felt like dying.

666
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,235
It's a miracle for someone to come back
from the brink of death twice.

667
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,237
So for me,

668
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:55,075
I don't hate In-ho or his mother
at all anymore.

669
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,077
I'm grateful for everything.

670
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,037
Of course, I'm grateful too.

671
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,874
They still gave us this building,
though it has some loans on it.

672
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,462
Do I seem too materialistic
if I'm like this?

673
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,090
Yes, just a little.

674
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,390
Mom, the bok choy grew so well.

675
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,726
They're growing so well.

676
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,186
Everything here tastes so good.

678
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,900
-Great work, Doctor.
-Great work.

679
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,534
Right, it's not this way.

680
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,669
How did it go?

681
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,964
That woman's colon really was quite long.

682
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,216
She must've had trouble
with her bowel movement.

683
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,762
The surgery went well.
She'll be a lot better now.

684
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,722
What a relief. Good job.

685
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,683
Do you have time on a weekday next week?

686
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,770
There's an 80-year-old man
in the hospice ward of my hospital.

687
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,773
He's had a hernia for a while,
so he'll need surgery.

688
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,026
Do you think I'm some kind of superhuman?

689
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,820
I'm busy with both the hospital
and your surgery favors.

690
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,948
I'm busier now than I was
when I was a first-year resident.

691
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,450
I need to rest too, you know?

692
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,411
He's a poor, elderly man
with no family or friends.

693
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,663
You can't expect to sit back

694
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,457
and do a good deed at the same time.

695
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,960
Forget it if you don't want to.

696
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,422
Who said I didn't want to?

697
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,803
I'll do it.

00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:50,816
Hey.

700
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:54,611
I forgot to tell you something.

701
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,446
Do you remember Roy?

702
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,989
Professor Kim? What about him?

703
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,699
I think he's seeing someone.

704
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,535
And it's serious.

705
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,373
What?

706
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,254
Hey.

707
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,421
Were you waiting long?

Let's go have something good.

709
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,012
-I know.
-You do?

710
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,974
I go to him for regular checkups
every two months even now.

711
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,434
He spoke about her a couple of times.

712
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,937
Don't you think it's a shame?

713
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,272
It's a shame for sure.

714
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,485
But from the very beginning,

715
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,071
I couldn't see the two of us together.

716
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,240
Goodness.

717
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:44,119
Then did you see you and In-ho together?

718
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,203
Hey!

719
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,584
Jeong-suk, you said you were
going to Gangwon-do today, right?

720
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,043
To be a medical volunteer.

721
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,712
Yes, do you want to come too?

722
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,797
I love you.

723
00:52:58,884 --> 00:52:59,843
How is it?

724
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,137
Your numbers.

725
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,848
Your numbers are all back to normal.

726
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,433
Amazing!

727
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,520
You did so well.
You must have worked really hard.

728
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:15,567
This is all thanks to you
since you visited often and helped me.

729
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,153
I was a bit of help, wasn't I?

730
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,863
Of course!

731
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,781
Do you think it's easy to come here

732
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,409
all the way from Seoul
as regularly as you have?

733
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,746
I told you the first time we met

734
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,706
that I'll come back no matter what.

735
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,125
Thank you.

736
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,544
I'm the one who's grateful.
You did such a good job.

737
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:45,639
SEOPGYO-RI REST AREA

738
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,684
Why did she ask me to come here?
I have bad memories of this place.

739
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,354
-Father, you're here.
-Hey.

740
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,605
Hello.

741
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,648
You got here quickly.

742
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,732
Go ahead and play.

743
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,570
There was no traffic.

744
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,821
Man, I'm tired.

745
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,741
All I want is to go to a sauna
and sweat things out.

746
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,910
Really? That's great.

747
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,412
Then head into town
and go to the bathhouse.

748
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,456
You can go with those men over there.

749
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,541
The bathhouse? And not treat any patients?

750
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,921
Didn't you call me to treat patients?

751
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,799
No, I called you here
because I needed a hand.

752
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,302
The bathhouse volunteers
hadn't been able to come

753
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,846
so the elders
couldn't take proper baths for a while.

754
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,309
-So?
-So I want you to help.

755
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,896
Me?

756
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:36,982
This feels so good.

757
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,067
You're good at this.

758
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,735
All done!

759
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,988
-Thank you.
-Yes, you can go this way.

760
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,948
Okay, next!

761
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,992
Sir, you can go that way.

762
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,202
Jung-min.

763
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,537
Lather him up.

764
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,289
-I'll finish things up for you later.
-Okay.

765
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,291
Okay, come this way.

766
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,893
I guess he's really tired.

767
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:16,730
Father.

768
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:18,857
Father.

769
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,818
Father!

770
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,865
He was tired.

771
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:27,949
He must be tired.

772
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,200
You have to go now.

773
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,079
Great job, Father.

774
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,208
Thanks for the coffee.

775
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,711
Drink it and shake off your sleepiness.

776
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,838
I'm really tired.

777
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,674
You did a great job.

778
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,053
The elders loved it so much.

779
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,097
I put every last bit of energy
I had into it.

780
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,851
Right, be good to your mother.

781
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,520
She called me a couple of days ago.

782
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,815
I heard you nagged her
about the dishes too.

783
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,698
Mother, you shouldn't clean them
so roughly like that.

784
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,618
You should clean them with chemicals,
not physical strength.

785
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,170
Then you do it.

786
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,588
You're all talk.

787
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,390
-Did I say anything wrong?
-Jeez.

788
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,601
-Mother is just being sensitive.
-Gosh.

789
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,645
Do you think I don't know you?

790
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,731
Even if it's the truth, say it nicely.

791
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:43,358
Nicely.

792
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,442
-Nicely.
-Okay.

793
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,070
That snow was unexpected.

794
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,031
It was amazing before. So pretty.

795
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,785
Will you go back to the Surgery Department

796
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,037
once you're done
serving as an army doctor?

797
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,291
I think I hated the Surgery Department
more out of rebellion.

798
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:05,171
But now that time has passed,
I want to go back into the surgery room.

799
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,215
That's a relief.

800
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,675
But when you return,

801
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,344
you'll have to call me "professor,"

802
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,930
even though I'm just
a clinical assistant professor.

803
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,891
You rank so much higher than me now.

804
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,648
I actually took a pregnancy test recently.

805
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,319
What?

806
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,655
Don't worry. It was negative.

807
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:32,991
But the thing is,

808
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,742
I thought about

809
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,245
what it'd be like if it was positive.

810
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,039
In that short moment,

811
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,667
I imagined us getting married
and having a kid.

812
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,338
It wasn't as bad as I thought.

813
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,890
I'm just saying!
Do you have anything to say about that?

814
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,017
Like, "I want to spend
the rest of my life with…"

815
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,271
Jeez.

816
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,232
I mean, I…

817
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,193
Just now…

818
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,778
For a split second,

819
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,364
I thought you were going to say
you were pregnant.

820
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,575
And…

821
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,453
at that moment,

822
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,330
I was feeling giddy.

823
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,415
What?

824
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,210
You seem disappointed.

825
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,381
Our kid came and left in an instant.

826
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,259
I want to see you, kiddo!

827
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,138
Hey, why are you speaking so loudly?
People will hear you.

828
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,056
Come here.

829
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,392
Kids, what's taking so long?
You should pack your things.

830
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,561
Let's go.

831
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,656
It'd be nice if we went too.

832
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,658
Will you be okay alone?

833
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,701
You have to take a boat
since it's a submerged area.

834
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,120
No, I can go alone.

835
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,706
There's a nurse and a social worker too.

836
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,002
You should hurry and go
before you get stuck in traffic.

837
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,754
Go.

838
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:10,672
Go.

839
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,090
Then we'll get going.

840
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:15,802
Mom, me too.

841
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,263
Message me often, Jung-min.

842
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,392
What? Hurry up and go.

843
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,269
Okay then. Bye.

844
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,855
-Bye.
-You drive. I really can't right now.

845
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,483
Jung-min, drive safely.

846
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,110
-I'll call you.
-Call me.

847
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,591
Hello.

848
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,550
Hello.

849
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,177
What's with the weather today?

850
00:59:58,928 --> 00:59:59,971
I'm a little late, aren't I?

851
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,681
No, we just got here too.

852
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:02,599
Let's go.

853
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,517
-How many places are we visiting today?
-Three places.

854
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:31,544
I'm grateful for everything
I'm able to see because I'm alive.

855
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,224
So I believe that

856
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:46,934
I'm happy

857
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,896
at this moment, as it is.

858
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,911
DOCTOR CHA
