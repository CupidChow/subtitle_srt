DOCTOR CHA

2
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,873
Have you been taking
your immunosuppressants?

3
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,583
Well…

4
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,254
I've been busy lately
so I did forget a couple of times,

5
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,840
but I did take them regularly.

6
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,258
How do you feel these days?

7
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,679
I'm tired even on my days off
and I've been having indigestion.

8
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,013
Since when?

9
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,890
Since about a week…

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,477
before my regular checkup?

11
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,105
Actually,

12
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,398
when I coughed today,

13
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,401
there was some blood.

14
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,364
That wouldn't be surprising.

15
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,284
Your CT and ultrasound readings came out,

16
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,494
and they're worse than I thought.

17
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,623
First, you have more ascites
than I anticipated,

18
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,501
and your liver density
has decreased by a lot.

19
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,962
Your L/S ratio has decreased a lot too,

20
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,548
and edema has formed
around your portal vein as well.

21
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:54,883
Your right lung

22
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,760
has also developed a pleural effusion.

23
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,055
Of course, we'll have to do
a biopsy to be sure,

24
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,473
but there's a possibility

25
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,559
this is a transplant rejection
or acute liver failure.

26
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,521
All this happened because I forgot
to take my immunosuppressants a few times?

27
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,233
You should be hospitalized,
have a biopsy done,

28
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,693
and receive steroid treatment.

29
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,153
This is…

30
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,447
just so sudden.

31
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,408
I'm still quite stunned.

32
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,371
It'll be a huge inconvenience to everyone
if one resident leaves.

33
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,415
I…

34
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,919
need some time to get things in order.

35
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,420
Do it as fast as you can.

36
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,632
Get things in order quickly
and get hospitalized.

37
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,957
Yes, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

38
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,418
Yes, patient Ms. Seok Hui-suk?

43
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,954
Yes, I'll be right up.

44
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,064
Yes, Cha Jeong-suk speaking.

45
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,025
Yes.

46
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,777
Hello.

47
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,738
How are you today?

48
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,740
Does your stomach still hurt? Did you eat?

49
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,158
You have to eat well.

50
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,087
I chugged three cups of coffee,
but I still feel sleepy.

51
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,631
I was on night duty
preparing for a conference,

52
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,091
so I only had two hours of sleep.

53
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,218
Dr. Cha, you seem fine.

54
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,596
Do I?

55
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,432
Will it get better in our second year?

56
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,852
We're dispatched anyway,
so it'll all be the same.

57
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,854
Still, I want to hurry up
and become a second-year.

58
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,397
Don't you agree?

59
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,319
Yes, I think it'll be great

60
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,571
once we become second-years.

61
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,492
It'll be

62
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,453
really great.

63
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,218
Hello.

64
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,637
Do you remember me?

65
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,556
-Yes.
-You haven't called.

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,017
So I came here to see you,
though it may seem rude.

67
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,146
Have you given it some thought?

68
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,149
About our father's bone marrow transplant.

69
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,193
Don't you feel

70
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,029
even slightly bad for asking me this?

71
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,240
We'll compensate you handsomely.

72
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,368
So please let us know
the amount you would like.

73
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,625
Yes?

74
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,336
Did you call for me, Professor?

75
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,173
Do you want coffee? I have tea too.

76
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,217
I'm fine. I already drank some.

77
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,473
But why did you want to see me?

78
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,183
Dr. Jeon, I want to ask you a favor.

79
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,396
Maybe I pushed myself too hard recently.
I'm feeling pretty tired.

80
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,981
I want to run some tests,

81
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,066
but it'd be weird to order them myself.

82
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,362
Can you put in an order for
a liver function test, a CT, and an MRI?

83
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,655
Yes, I can do that.

84
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,159
If this is your medical checkup,

85
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,244
should I add a gastroscopy
or a colonoscopy as well?

86
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,249
I think that can be done
after seeing the blood test results.

87
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:42,378
Also, please ask that they run
a 1mm-thick scan for the liver CT.

88
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,713
One millimeter?

89
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,885
Isn't 1mm the protocol
for liver cancer or a liver transplant?

90
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,428
Why would…

91
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,846
Because I need to.

92
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,974
-Okay.
-Thank you.

93
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,601
Okay, I'll get it done.

94
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,466
Yes?

95
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,384
The police station?

96
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,137
Yes, this is Kwak Ae-sim.

97
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,223
You're a victim of the Seomun
convalescent hospital scam, right?

98
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,308
Victim? Me?

99
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,936
That land is prohibited from development,

100
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,688
but we received a report that investments
were received to develop a hospital.

101
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,857
It looks to be a sophisticated scam case.

102
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,944
I think you'll have to come
to the Seodaemun Police Station.

103
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:49,862
I see.

104
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,453
Professor.

105
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,623
Ms. Kwak.

106
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,793
You must know now
since the police station contacted you.

107
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,962
I'm very sorry about the investment.

108
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,882
I lost both money and friends over this.

109
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,594
The woman you met at the restaurant

110
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,305
was a woman I had been seeing
after my wife died.

111
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,601
I had no choice but to reconcile with her
because of this recent incident.

112
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,729
Please forget about a loser like me
and start over with someone new.

113
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,106
Hello?

114
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,906
Ms. Kwak? Is that you?

115
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,535
Ms. Min, it's been a while.

116
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,203
What a coincidence.

117
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,413
I know, right?

118
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,500
There are rumors that
the convalescent hospital you invested in

119
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
is all a scam.

120
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,628
Is that true?

121
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,339
The money you borrowed from me
is safe, right?

122
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,299
Of course.

123
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,264
Professor Choi, over here.

124
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,862
I have some materials
I urgently have to review.

125
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,989
I think I'll have to eat later.

126
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,032
Do it after you eat.

127
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,577
I have something to give
the professors in our department.

128
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,871
I'm sorry.
You can give it to me next time.

129
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,289
Okay.

130
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,463
Okay, let's get up too.

131
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,173
Take your time.

132
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,641
Thank you…

133
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,186
to you both.

134
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,103
For…

135
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,647
For what?

136
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,315
For being my fellow residents.

137
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,025
They say the friends you make

138
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,069
during med school
and your residency last forever.

139
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,615
But I haven't worked for so long
that I haven't seen my colleagues in ages.

140
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:03,120
I wanted to thank you
for eating with an old resident like me

141
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,375
and letting me in on things I don't know.

142
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,921
It's nothing.

143
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,840
That's nice and all,

144
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,593
but you're talking
as if you're going somewhere far away.

145
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,761
It feels weird.

146
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,807
Be on good terms
with the other residents too.

147
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,018
It'll be awkward if you become enemies
with someone you'll work with.

148
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,561
-Take it.
-No.

149
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,438
-Like them?
-I won't!

150
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,191
-Take Bong-suk's wedding invitation.
-No, I won't!

151
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,735
You of all people
must accept this, you punk!

152
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,862
I of all people won't accept it!

153
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,447
I won't accept it!

154
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,992
Then I'll read it to you.

155
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,494
Don't read it. I won't listen.

156
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,288
Even if I had ten ears,
they are all closed!

157
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,250
Let go of me!

158
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,253
Professor Oh, read it!

159
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,671
No, I'll kill you if you do!

160
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,424
-Don't read it, you punk!
-"Wedding invitation."

161
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,050
"We are two people

162
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,927
who used to walk on separate paths."

163
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,178
Then keep walking separately!

164
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,848
-"But we'll now walk on the same path."
-Don't walk on the same path!

165
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,559
"Please join us in blessing
our new life together."

166
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,352
"The groom, Jung Seong-han."

167
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,021
"The bride, Lim Bong-suk!"

168
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,778
Bong-suk!

169
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,449
Hey, Chief Yoon.

170
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,826
Make sure you come to the wedding.

171
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,328
I'll pay for your meal ticket.

172
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,372
Would you go if you were me?

173
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,168
"I am leaving once this night passes,
to a person I don't want to go to."

174
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,338
"As my tears fall,
I depart to a person I do not even love."

175
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,174
"I shed endless tears."

176
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,509
Hey, hold on.

177
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,470
Where is Professor Seo?

178
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,637
I need to give him this.

179
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,890
Something came up at home,
so he left early.

180
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,224
Really?

181
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,642
I have to give him this.

182
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,561
Bong-suk!

183
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,273
LAW FIRM KIM DONG-WOOK

184
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,691
Mother.

185
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,026
Why on earth are we here?

186
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,988
If you're going to get a divorce anyway,
you need to be prepared too.

187
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,740
Are you just going to
let her walk over you?

188
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,325
Jeong-suk even sent you
a divorce petition!

189
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,493
I'm not getting a divorce.

190
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,411
You need this!

191
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,829
This is necessary. Follow me.

192
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,414
-Come on.
-Follow me.

193
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,626
After hearing your story,

194
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,796
it's undeniably clear that
you're the spouse at fault.

195
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,174
So naturally, you don't have
the upper hand.

196
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,300
Then,

197
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:22,927
what about the assets?

198
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,845
Will he get his assets taken from him?

199
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,932
How will the assets be divided?

200
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,768
Division of assets
depends on contribution,

201
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,021
but recently, the importance
of domestic work has been recognized,

202
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,525
so there have been cases
where up to 50% has been awarded.

203
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,362
So she gets half of his fortune
when she didn't contribute anything to it?

204
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,613
What kind of law is that?

205
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:48,035
She has a building under her name.
Does she get half of that too?

206
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,704
It's actually my building,
but it's just under her name.

207
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,416
She doesn't know that she has a building
or anything else under her name.

208
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,921
Did you buy the building
under her name to avoid taxes?

209
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,214
Yes, that was the case.

210
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,425
In that case,
that counts as ownership trust.

211
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,386
You can be punished by law.

212
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,846
According to criminal law,
you can go to prison for five years

213
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,349
or get a fine of less than
200 million won.

214
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,851
Even if we put that aside,

215
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,395
you'd need to prove that

216
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,856
your daughter-in-law didn't contribute
to the building's purchase.

217
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,985
-But that seems difficult in this case.
-My goodness. Then…

218
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,572
are you saying my building
will be taken away?

219
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,535
I mean,

220
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,913
how could you keep
something like that a secret from me?

221
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,040
Let's talk about that later.

222
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,126
First, we need to sell that building.

223
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,129
Tell Jeong-suk the truth
and put the building on the market.

224
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,672
Even if we sell below the market price.

225
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,466
Why would you want to sell that
below the market price?

226
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,680
About that.

227
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,433
I can't believe
something like this happened.

228
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,350
Mother!

229
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,355
Three hundred…

230
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,025
You gave that scamming bastard
300 million won?

231
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,401
With the money you borrowed?

232
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,111
I didn't give it to him.

233
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,863
I invested.

234
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,781
That's the same thing, Mother!

235
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,992
You can get mad at me later.

236
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,452
What should I do?

237
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,164
If I don't pay back that money,
I'll become an outcast among my alumni.

238
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,416
The building won't sell easily.

239
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,294
Can't you get a credit loan?

240
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,296
You're a doctor.

241
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,548
In-ho, do something.

242
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,841
Do you not remember?

243
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,553
I took out the biggest credit loan
I could get last year

244
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,097
and repaid the secured loan on the house.

245
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,975
Interest rates are high these days.

246
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,227
Do you know how much
the interest is each month?

247
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,105
Then what do I do?

248
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,440
Your mother's reputation

249
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,483
is about to be destroyed

250
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,611
because of 300 million won!

251
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,365
-Hey.
-I have to head back for a surgery.

252
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,699
You pay for the meal.

253
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,159
In-ho.

254
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,619
In-ho.

255
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,436
JUNG-MIN'S MOM

256
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:25,943
Hey, it's me.

257
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,779
Let's meet later.

258
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,075
You could've told me over the phone.
Why did you insist on meeting?

259
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,451
What is it?

260
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,121
This isn't something
I can discuss over the phone.

261
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,790
But why do you look so pale?

262
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,667
What do you mean?

263
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,752
Did you…

264
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,254
hear anything--

265
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,673
Mother purchased a building
under your name.

266
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,010
What?

267
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,804
You mean the one in Gimpo?

268
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,180
You knew?

269
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,890
I found out when I went to the bank

270
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,476
to take out a loan for I-rang's academy.

271
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,062
But what about it?

272
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,898
Why did you pretend
like you didn't know about it?

273
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,485
Forget it.

274
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,321
She got herself into trouble,
so she needs to sell the building.

275
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,657
You need to put it on the market.

276
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,451
If we list it below market price--

277
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,368
I don't want to.

278
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,662
-What?
-I don't want to.

279
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,081
I don't want to sell it.

280
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:21,999
Do you…

281
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,588
Jeong-suk.

282
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,842
It may be in your name,
but it belongs to Mother.

283
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,010
Do you have proof?

284
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,094
Are you crazy?

285
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,721
Yes, I am crazy.

286
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,558
Why do I have to obediently cooperate
with the people who've used me?

287
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,853
Just think of it as a division of assets,
in a broader sense.

288
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,521
We're not even divorced.

289
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,899
Why on earth are you mentioning
division of assets?

290
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,985
I really didn't want to say this,

291
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
but did you contribute even a single thing

292
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,198
to the creation of these assets?

293
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,116
Don't be ridiculous!

294
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,827
I see you had a plan all along.

295
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,955
Is this why you refused when I offered you
joint ownership of the house?

296
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,916
That's right.

297
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,044
I had a bit of conscience left,
so I was going to take the building

298
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,837
and let you have the house.

299
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,465
Anyway, I don't want to sell it.

300
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,635
I'll claim the rights
to whatever is under my name,

301
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,719
and that's that.

302
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,721
Then what about the money
that Mother owes?

303
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,973
Just sell the house
and take care of it with that.

304
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,892
Move to a smaller place,

305
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,687
or if you don't want to do that,
then buy a big house in the suburbs.

306
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,440
If you sell the house,
both options are possible.

307
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,786
That's it.

308
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,748
There are multiple ways of doing squats.

309
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,291
You can do that way too.

310
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,376
Ms. Oh!

311
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,131
-What?
-Ms. Oh, please open the door.

312
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,383
-Ms. Oh.
-Goodness!

313
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,845
Oh, my goodness!
Ms. Kwak, what are you doing here?

314
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,847
Gosh, you reek of alcohol!

315
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,975
-Why did you drink this much…
-Ms. Oh.

316
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,394
Have you been well?

317
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,605
Goodness.

318
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,606
Gosh, wait.

319
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,113
I'm heading to…

320
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,827
Did she go to exercise?

321
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,004
Are you up?

322
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,965
You should get up and have breakfast
if you're awake.

323
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,260
I thought your stomach might be upset,
so I made a clear broth.

324
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,414
I think I made
a lot of mistakes last night.

325
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,666
Yes, you did.

326
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,963
Don't assume

327
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,173
That I lived this way or that way

328
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,557
Jeez.

329
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,858
You don't have to describe it
in such detail.

330
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,778
Please forget all of that
as fast as you can, Ms. Oh.

331
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,321
You're really upset

332
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,157
about the kids, right?

333
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,117
Thinking about the kids getting a divorce

334
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,037
makes me feel

335
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,748
like there's a hole in my chest.

336
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,667
It's not because I feel bad for In-ho.

337
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,170
It's because I can't live
without Jeong-suk, Ms. Oh.

338
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,297
I'm being honest.

339
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,216
I really liked Jeong-suk.

340
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,468
She wasn't like a daughter-in-law.

341
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,220
No matter how much I whined,

342
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,390
she accepted it all like an older sister.

343
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,767
Honestly, that's who she was to me.

344
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,728
You should treat your daughter-in-law
like your daughter-in-law.

345
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,771
You can't depend on her

346
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,731
like an older sister.

347
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,527
If you're an adult,
shouldn't you act like one?

348
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,322
Don't talk about
how much you liked Jeong-suk now.

349
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,658
Because of you,

350
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:29,204
Jeong-suk suffered
so much both physically and mentally.

351
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,915
Even so,

352
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,419
maybe she knew that's how you felt

353
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,131
because she doesn't seem
to hold much hate for you.

354
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,424
Sometimes,

355
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,551
it seemed like

356
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,179
she was trying to be the bigger person
by not thinking too much about it.

357
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,600
But I can't say that she should
continue to live in that house

358
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,187
just so you can be comfortable.

359
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:00,235
All we can do is just watch them
handle things on their own.

360
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,074
Ma'am, do you still not have any energy?

361
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,200
Yes.

362
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,913
Ma'am, you're being injected
with nutrients.

363
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,041
Since you can't eat,

364
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,336
you're being provided
with nutrients through this injection.

365
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,048
And the results of the tests
you took before will come out soon,

366
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,382
so just wait a bit longer.

367
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,927
You just don't have energy
when you're old.

368
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,221
What's the point of tests?

369
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,641
I'll tell you a secret.

370
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,521
You're my last patient.

371
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,276
So I want to make sure you're all better
when you're discharged.

372
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,239
She was born in 1920?

373
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,326
Then that'd make her over a 100 now.

374
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,162
This is the first time I'm seeing
a patient that old in this hospital.

375
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,081
People really do live to 100 these days.

376
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,416
But why was she hospitalized?

377
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,835
It's all the same for patients
of that age.

378
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,171
They either have no energy
or are unable to digest well.

379
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,050
Dr. Cha, she's going home
after getting the IV drip, right?

380
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,552
That was the plan.

381
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,805
But she has indigestion and chest pain,

382
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,182
so I had an APCT done just in case.

383
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,186
The video was uploaded, so I'm checking…

384
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,647
What?

385
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,775
It's an aortic dissection.

386
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,277
It's a critical situation

387
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,488
when the most important artery
in our body is torn.

388
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,825
She needs to be transferred to
Cardiothoracic Surgery for an operation.

389
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,786
But due to her age,
I don't know if they will do the surgery.

390
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,663
If she doesn't get surgery…

391
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,543
the chances she will die are very high.

392
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:46,049
We brought her here because
she couldn't eat or digest anything.

393
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:50,137
It's common for elderly patients
not to show many symptoms.

394
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,555
Then…

395
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:57,435
do you mean my mother
could pass away immediately?

396
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,479
If she doesn't get surgery immediately,

397
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,941
then yes, that could happen.

398
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,821
I'll first contact
the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department.

399
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,447
Please wait in the hospital

400
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,367
just in case you need to do
some paperwork regarding surgery.

401
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,248
Hello.

402
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,668
Is this Professor Seo In-ho's office?

403
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,295
Yes, that's right.

404
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,713
I'm a college classmate

405
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,091
of your mother, Kwak Ae-sim.

406
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:29,968
I see.

407
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,347
She would always brag about her son,

408
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,976
so I stopped by
during a visit to the hospital.

409
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,396
-I see.
-I don't know if you know this.

410
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:48,195
Your mother borrowed
a little money from me.

411
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,573
I thought you should
be aware of this as her son,

412
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,871
since your reputation shouldn't be ruined
because of your mother.

413
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,040
You know how people get exposed for…

414
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,209
a family member's unpaid debt.

415
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,087
That happens to lots of people these days.

416
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,104
MOTHER

417
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,858
Yes, Mother.

418
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,110
In-ho, about that building.

419
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,364
I think it'll be difficult
to liquidate it.

420
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,407
Which led me to think…

421
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,786
Here's an idea.

422
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,162
What idea?

423
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,163
Seung-hi.

424
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,415
How about borrowing money from her?

425
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,584
-What?
-Isn't 300 million won

426
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,502
just chump change to her?

427
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,045
What are you even saying…

428
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,924
Mother, don't even dream of it.

429
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,396
Professor Choi.

430
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,945
Do you have some time tonight?

431
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,368
PATIENT NAME: LEE PAN-SIM
DATE OF BIRTH: APRIL 21, 1920

432
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,787
What do you think it's like

433
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,206
to live until you're 100?

434
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,042
Just thinking about it is horrible.

435
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:32,132
That patient is really lucky
that such a critical condition

436
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,884
was quickly discovered thanks to you.

437
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,928
Is she?

438
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,354
-How can I help you?
-I'm Ms. Lee Pan-sim's guardian.

439
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,564
Yes.

440
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,899
What brings you here?

441
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,568
Who told you to take a CT?

442
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,403
What?

443
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,322
She's old, so we didn't expect much.

444
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,699
We told you to just give her an IV drip.

445
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,161
How much longer do you think
she is going to live?

446
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,538
Aren't you just trying to make money?

447
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,206
No, it's not that--

448
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,666
She was just about to die,

449
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,877
so we reserved the funeral home

450
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,837
and contacted all our relatives.

451
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,049
So you came here

452
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,428
to pick a fight over
why I was trying to save my patient?

453
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,473
Excuse me,

454
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,516
Doctor.

455
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,977
My mother has lived a long life.

456
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,230
I'll be 80 soon too.

457
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:35,362
I'm tired of life even at my age,
so how do you think my mother feels?

458
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,743
What's the point of fighting?
Let's just go.

459
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,428
Is this the afterlife?

460
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,347
Ma'am.

461
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,140
Are you awake?

462
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,060
So I'm alive.

463
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,106
I was trying to go this time,

464
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,191
but I wasn't able to.

465
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,777
I wasn't able to go again.

466
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,072
Living a long time…

467
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,699
is punishment too.

468
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,035
It's punishment.

469
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,960
It's a blessing to pass

470
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,712
when your children
are still sad to see you go.

471
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,598
So you're saying
you want to take a leave of absence?

472
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,517
Yes.

473
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,811
And you are aware
that the residents who are left

474
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,522
will suffer two or three times
as much if you leave now?

475
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,481
Yes.

476
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,316
I am aware.

477
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,864
Have a seat.

478
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,619
Dr. Cha.

479
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,329
You've done well until now.

480
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,668
Do you think it's easy for a resident
who takes a leave of absence to return?

481
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,965
I know this hospital
received a donation thanks to you,

482
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,925
but isn't this asking for too much?

483
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,428
Let's hear the reason.

484
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,387
What's the issue?

485
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,347
Is the work too hard?

486
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,600
I'm the issue.

487
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,854
My liver transplant isn't doing well.

488
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,149
I have to be hospitalized
and treated again.

489
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,111
I have neglected myself.

490
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,785
-Chief Lim.
-Yes?

491
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:51,122
Will there still be a place for me here
even if I take a leave of absence?

492
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,832
I'm not sure.

493
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,710
I can't answer that right away.

494
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,088
I know it may seem irresponsible,

495
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,634
but please tell me
I can come back, Chief Lim.

496
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,851
When I came back to the hospital,

497
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:16,856
I was determined to live as a doctor
while I was still alive.

498
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,319
If you tell me I can come back
after getting treated,

499
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,824
I think it'll help me stay strong.

500
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,830
Because it'll mean
I have a place to come back to.

501
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:41,172
PROFESSOR ROY
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

502
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,180
Dr. Cha is taking a leave of absence?

503
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,932
That's what happened.

504
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,852
You remember Dr. Cha
received a liver transplant

505
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,396
before she applied
to be a resident here, right?

506
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,524
It seems that her liver was damaged again.

507
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,818
She says she needs
to be hospitalized right away.

508
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:07,156
Professor Choi, please explain
the situation to her fellow residents.

509
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,327
It's hard on everyone
when even one person leaves the hospital.

510
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,079
I will.

511
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,958
But shouldn't this call for a resignation
instead of a leave of absence?

512
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,795
It'd be hard not to hire someone new
while we wait for her return.

513
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,171
I know.

514
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,884
I don't know why this is happening
right after her mother recovered.

515
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,469
Dr. Cha wants to be reinstated
after being treated,

516
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,139
but I think there will be
a lot of complications.

517
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,391
I don't know
whether to accept her reinstatement

518
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,851
or to suggest resignation.

519
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,477
It's a real headache.

520
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,317
You'll do what for me?

521
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,695
I think I'll be able to donate
my liver to you.

522
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,406
I took a test and the results are good.

523
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,699
It's entirely possible.

524
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,201
You'd donate your liver to me?

525
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,080
That's out of the question.

526
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,457
Why?

527
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,667
The man who abandoned me

528
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,004
showed up after 40 years
and asked for a bone marrow transplant

529
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,173
just because he's my biological father.

530
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,551
On the other hand,
you're someone much closer to me.

531
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,178
You're my patient,

532
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,349
a friend, and a colleague I care about.

533
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,935
What more is there to explain?

534
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,565
This was a hard decision
even for my husband of 20 years

535
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,859
to go through with.

536
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,070
This isn't something
you should decide on a whim.

537
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:31,324
I want to see you live a healthy life.

538
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,910
That's reason enough.

539
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:34,994
And another thing.

540
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,415
I'm healthy and my liver is big,

541
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,543
so it's fine to cut a bit off.

542
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,676
If you don't want my liver,
get treated well and get better soon.

543
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,597
Are you ready to be hospitalized?

544
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,475
Yes.

545
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,185
I'm ready.

546
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,843
CHA JEONG-SUK

547
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,972
CHA JEONG-SUK

548
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,503
Ms. Cha Jeong-suk!

549
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,550
-I guess you're leaving work.
-Yes.

550
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,845
I think I might end up
getting exposed for Mother's debt.

551
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,139
A creditor even came to visit me
in the hospital.

552
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,517
This is all thanks to you.

553
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,602
Why is that thanks to me?

554
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,104
It's thanks to your mother.

555
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,107
Right, then I'll correct myself.
It's thanks to both of you.

556
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,775
-Happy?
-I am.

557
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,945
You'll become rich!

558
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,530
It must be nice!

559
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,824
What a jerk.

560
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,787
What is it?

561
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,289
You never ask to meet with me first.

562
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,960
The thing is…

563
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,253
I really wanted

564
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,506
to thank you for treating
my mother-in-law.

565
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,675
I only did my job.

566
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,345
Still, you must have felt terrible,

567
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,473
so I wanted to say I'm sorry,
and thank you so much.

568
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,601
Those are the only two things
you always say.

569
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,228
Fine.

570
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,688
I'll accept your gratitude.

571
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,149
Are you done?

572
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,109
What?

573
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,747
Do you…

574
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,544
want to invest in me?

575
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,045
Invest?

576
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,551
How much?

577
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,386
About…

578
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,013
300 million won?

579
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,307
I'm not asking you to just give it to me.

580
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,476
I'm saying to invest it
in the man that I am.

581
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,981
I'll make sure
to pay you interest regularly.

582
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,193
You bastard.

583
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,154
You want to borrow money from me
after everything you've done?

584
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,948
What is wrong with you?

585
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,535
And what's with this sexy act?

586
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,831
Do you think I'll just hand over money
to a bad boy like your mother did?

587
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,250
How did you know?

588
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,128
Even a kid would know
this is just your imagination.

589
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,213
What?

590
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,216
You should try to make yourself
look pitiable instead.

591
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,684
If you have nothing more to say,
I'm leaving.

592
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,269
Wait!

593
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,606
Seung-hi.

594
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,319
Seung-hi.

595
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,487
Please lend me money.

596
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,241
What are you doing? Get up.

597
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,077
I'm not asking for a handout.
Just lend me some money.

598
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,037
I'll be homeless at this rate.

599
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,121
Seung-hi.

600
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,833
In-ho.

601
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,378
I know we were in a relationship,

602
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,297
but there's a line you shouldn't cross.

603
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,427
You're trying to act weak to control me.

604
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,680
But this is a type of gaslighting.

605
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,724
Is this…

606
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,894
also my imagination?

607
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,187
You caught on quickly.

608
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,398
You shouldn't do that

609
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,317
in reality, okay?

610
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,028
You told me to act pitiable instead.

611
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,155
You did seem less of a jerk than before.

612
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,540
You have nothing else to say, right?

613
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,418
Then it's my turn to talk.

614
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,878
Did you know

615
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,423
your wife is quitting the hospital?

616
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,050
What?

617
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,304
Here.

618
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,347
This looks delicious!

619
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,057
Thank you for all this.

620
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,892
It's been a while
since I've cooked you a meal, right?

621
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,936
Yes, I missed your cooking so much!

622
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:38,107
What's the occasion?
Why did you come all the way here to cook?

623
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,859
I did this just because.

624
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,154
-Mom, more meat please.
-How pretty.

625
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,614
-Me first.
-You can't be a picky eater.

626
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,283
-Give me some first.
-Okay.

627
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,369
Why did Jeong-suk quit the hospital?

628
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,413
She wants to take a leave of absence,
to be precise.

629
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,914
Leave of absence?

630
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,126
When I ran into her before,

631
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,961
she just seemed all high and mighty.

632
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,340
Did you not know your wife was ill?

633
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,925
Her condition isn't good right now.

634
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,553
She'll go through drug therapy
at the hospital.

635
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,013
In the worst-case scenario,

636
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,891
she'll have to consider
getting another transplant.

637
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,440
It seems that…

638
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,902
I have…

639
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,905
to be hospitalized again for treatment.

640
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,661
Don't worry too much.

641
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,956
I'll recover quickly
after receiving drug therapy.

642
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,793
Are things really bad?

643
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,961
If you need to be hospitalized…

644
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,593
Well,

645
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,638
if the situation gets worse,

646
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,308
I might have to get another transplant.

647
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,310
But it won't come to that.

648
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,771
So don't worry, okay?

649
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,321
It's all my fault.

650
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,532
It's all my fault.

651
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,078
You were stressed out and on edge
because I was sick.

652
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,706
You were already exhausted,
and I made you worried on top of that.

653
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,834
Mom, stop.

654
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,503
Don't say that. How is this your fault?

655
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,506
Mom, I really can get through this.

656
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,007
So don't worry.

657
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,010
No need to worry ahead of time.

658
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,804
I can really get through this well.

659
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,850
I'm really okay.

660
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,186
So don't be too sad

661
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,564
or feel tortured over this.

662
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,528
Let's think of good thoughts
and get through this, okay?

663
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,030
Okay?

664
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,366
Mom.

665
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,124
I was really shocked too.

666
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,834
Are you sure?

667
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,465
We have some responsibility

668
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,384
for Jeong-suk ending up like this.

669
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,928
Since we did a lot of
unacceptable things to her.

670
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,910
Is your condition bad enough
that I have to cancel my conference?

671
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,832
Honey, it's so pretty.

672
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,584
I'm glad to hear you like it.

673
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,171
I'll cherish this forever.

674
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,215
Thank you, honey.

675
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,593
Come on, don't go overboard.
I can just buy you another one.

676
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,637
This is the first present
I've received from you.

677
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,097
So it's that much more meaningful.

678
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,853
You'll be 50 by the time you finish.

679
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,689
The average life expectancy is longer now,
so that's still young.

680
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,067
Who would welcome
an old and sick resident?

681
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,444
Don't be a nuisance and just drop it.

682
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,364
Fine.

683
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,282
If you so insist, go ahead.

684
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,159
I won't stop you, so do your best.

685
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,370
-Really?
-Yes.

686
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,914
Do what you want,
since it's your decision.

687
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,375
Just pretend we don't know
each other at work.

688
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,753
Don't even dream of whining
or complaining about your tough work.

689
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,171
Do not ask me for help.

690
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,756
Do not expect to receive

691
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,342
any special treatment
just because I'm there.

692
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,720
We will be complete strangers
at the hospital.

693
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,766
I will only treat you
as a rookie resident, do you understand?

694
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,645
Yes!

695
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,146
So please just quit!

696
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,358
Do you know how hard it is
to see you at work?

697
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:57,616
You say whatever you want,
but have you ever considered how I feel?

698
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,034
No.

699
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,454
I didn't think
about how you felt on purpose.

700
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,331
I want to put myself first from now on.

701
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,127
I finally realized
there's a life for me out there,

702
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,628
so I can't stop again now!

703
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,755
Honey, this is my last chance.

704
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:16,802
Please…

705
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,263
let me continue down this path.

706
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:23,559
I won't even ask for you
to help pave the road or hold my hand.

707
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,518
Just…

708
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,689
let me be able to walk down this path.

709
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,806
Is it because of that punk?

710
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,100
Roy Kimberley?

711
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,603
Don't get ahead of yourself.

712
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,897
Do you think
that decent young man is into you?

713
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,532
We're not even divorced.

714
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,618
Why on earth are you mentioning
division of assets?

715
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,704
I really didn't want to say this,

716
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,289
but did you contribute even a single thing

717
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,917
to the creation of these assets?

718
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,585
Don't be ridiculous!

719
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,290
Professor Kim,

720
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,043
please explain
my wife's condition in detail.

721
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,048
I need to know now, at least.

722
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,094
The results of her blood tests
and her liver ultrasound aren't good.

723
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,555
Her symptoms are quickly getting worse.

724
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,267
Her abdomen is distended due to ascites,
and her lungs are filled with fluid

725
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,144
which is causing breathing difficulties.

726
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,688
This will be hard to regulate
through diuretics alone.

727
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,065
We'll have to do a biopsy,

728
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,150
but from the looks of it…

729
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,528
it's either acute liver failure
or transplant rejection.

730
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,489
If my wife

731
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,909
needs a liver transplant, I'll do it.

732
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,163
That's what I came to tell you.

733
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,044
It seems quite late for that.

734
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,548
I know it's late,

735
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,426
but I want to make up for it.

736
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,613
How did you find out?

737
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,076
How long did you think
I'd stay in the dark?

738
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,121
You've been admitted
to the department I work for.

739
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,751
Yes.

740
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,128
This is what happened.

741
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,672
There's nothing I can do
this time as well.

742
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:45,469
I can only get treated
and hope for the best.

743
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,386
Yes.

744
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,308
Get drug therapy and if it doesn't work,
I'll donate my liver to you.

745
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,643
So don't worry too much.

746
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,021
Now you've decided to?

747
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,440
I know it's late, but yes.

748
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,442
I don't

749
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,694
need your liver.

750
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,573
You refused to give it to me
when I needed it most.

751
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,325
So why are you acting like this now?

752
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,079
Did you think

753
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,624
I'd give you back the building
out of gratitude for this?

754
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,210
Is that why?

755
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,214
I called the real estate agency
and put the building on the market.

756
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,216
I gave them your phone number,

757
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,927
so you should receive a call
if there's a buyer.

758
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,556
Why do you always make me out
to be the bastard?

759
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,691
I…

760
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,402
What I did was wrong, but still.

761
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,862
You should…

762
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,241
still give me one last chance.

763
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,077
You should give me the chance

764
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,372
to make up for the hurt I've caused you.

765
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,708
You should give me

766
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:03,213
at least one chance to be the tiniest bit

767
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,841
of help to you

768
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,552
as the father of our children

769
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,847
and as your husband.

770
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:13,765
It's…

771
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,101
all pointless.

772
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,814
We'll break up in the end.

773
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,777
So let's not make things difficult,

774
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,155
and end things when we can.

775
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,242
Even when we were
a regular married couple,

776
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,786
you weren't able
to willingly donate your liver to me.

777
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,165
What's the point of giving me your liver
and getting a chance after all this?

778
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,499
I don't need any of that.

779
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,502
If I die,

780
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,631
then that's just my fate.

781
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,592
What do you mean by fate?

782
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,386
It's all my fault.

783
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,348
No, it's not your fault.
This isn't happening because of you.

784
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,643
So stop.

785
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,228
It's my fate.

786
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,649
It's my fault
I wasn't able to maintain my health.

787
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:04,941
It's no one else's fault.

788
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:41,937
No, it's not your fault.
This isn't happening because of you.

789
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,730
It's my fate.

790
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,650
It's my fault
I wasn't able to maintain my health.

791
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,943
It's no one else's fault.

792
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,084
What are you looking at so intently?

793
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,169
Something interesting to see?

794
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,425
I can see the funeral home from this room.

795
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,223
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL FUNERAL HOME

796
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,435
Out of all the rooms, why did…

797
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,479
No, it's okay.

798
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:31,903
I think it makes you realize
how close you are to life and death

799
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,114
when you're in a hospital.

800
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,909
Just think of good things.

801
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,787
Thoughts like successfully
getting treated, going home,

802
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,914
and getting reinstated.

803
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,792
Even if they aren't
those kinds of thoughts,

804
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,712
I feel like

805
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,174
I'm in the midst…

806
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,551
of a beautiful moment.

807
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,970
I've eaten various delicious food,

808
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,931
seen many amazing sights,

809
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,434
and studied as much as I could…

810
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,313
in my life up until now.

811
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,275
I saw my kids grow up

812
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,903
without missing a moment too.

813
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,784
I think I would consider myself so lucky

814
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,452
if I were able to die

815
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,331
amid a beautiful moment like this,

816
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,084
before I become too much
for my children to bear.

817
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:30,670
So,

818
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,215
I'm not sad.

819
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:38,720
I feel…

820
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,389
at ease, Professor Kim.

821
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,187
The difficult tests will start tomorrow.

822
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,647
Your tests are done for today.

823
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,525
Is there anything you want to do
before you get stuck in here?

824
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,860
There are so many things.

825
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,780
It's hard to choose what to do first.

826
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,450
Professor Kim.

827
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,661
Can I ask you for a favor?

828
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,622
I thought of something I want to do.

829
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,513
Why are you just leaving?

830
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,312
Didn't you come to see me?

831
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,148
-That's right.
-Why?

832
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,401
To see what kind of state I'm in?

833
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,034
Get better and come back to work soon.

834
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:47,831
I will.

835
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:48,957
You…

836
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,459
had thanked me.

837
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,338
But I wasn't able to say anything.

838
00:52:59,134 --> 00:52:59,968
I'm sorry.

839
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,227
I imagined what it'd be like
to hear those words from you.

840
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,646
I thought nothing would change

841
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,816
no matter what you said.

842
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,361
But it's better than
not hearing it at all.

843
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,577
When I got to college

844
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,829
and met you,

845
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,373
I wanted to be friends with you.

846
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,544
You got good grades and were smart…

847
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,298
but you weren't a shameless brat.

848
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,842
You came from an affluent family,

849
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,303
but you didn't make that obvious.

850
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,182
If things hadn't become
so difficult between us…

851
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,936
then maybe right about now,

852
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,105
we'd be eating a meal together

853
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,568
while complaining
about our husbands to each other.

854
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,741
Am I an idiot…

855
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,370
for feeling sad about this?

856
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,458
This whole time,

857
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,044
you…

858
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,254
and I…

859
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,345
went through so much.

860
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,306
I want to be…

861
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,769
at peace now.

862
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,067
I hope you can too.

863
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,336
JUNG-MIN'S MOM
SORRY FOR YELLING AT YOU EARLIER

864
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:47,177
I WASN'T ACTUALLY ANGRY AT YOU
I WAS ANGRY AT MYSELF

865
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,928
I'M REALLY SORRY IF I HURT…

866
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,389
What were you saying
about Professor Roy before?

867
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,516
The chief resident said that

868
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,438
he asked Dr. Jeon to run
a liver function test and a CT for him.

869
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,066
And a 1mm-thick scan of the liver at that.

870
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,025
A 1mm scan?

871
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,360
Why?

872
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,321
Does he have a really bad liver?

873
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,406
It's not that. The chief resident thinks

874
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,950
it's about Dr. Cha Jeong-suk.

875
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,619
Dr. Cha Jeong-suk…

876
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,745
My mom?

877
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,747
Yes, your mom is currently hospitalized.

878
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,750
What does that have to do
with my mother being hospitalized?

879
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,711
Hey, the pure love and devotion of a man.

880
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,463
Don't you get it?

881
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,715
My goodness.

882
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:30,011
It seems Professor Roy has decided
to donate his liver to your mother.

883
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,764
Hey, what are you talking about?

884
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,360
Where are you right now?

885
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,654
I asked you where you are!

886
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,372
Why did he ask me
to come to a place like this?

887
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,083
You got here quickly.

888
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,631
Why would you give your liver to my wife?

889
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:08,633
Why can't I?

890
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:12,929
As you already know,
organ donors don't have to be relatives.

891
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,889
That's not what I'm saying right now.

892
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,685
She has me. I'll give her my liver.
So why are you butting in here?

893
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,646
Because I don't know
when you'll change your mind again.

894
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,731
I'd rather give her my liver.

895
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,649
Are you crazy?

896
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,568
Why would she accept your liver
instead of mine?

897
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:29,028
And I don't even drink.
My liver is fresher.

898
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,364
I'm younger and work out a lot.

899
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,657
So don't be ridiculous.

900
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,909
And you've been drinking a lot lately.

901
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,413
As if that amount would do much!

902
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,532
-What are you doing here?
-You don't need to know.

903
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,119
The two of you should stop.

904
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,371
I heard every little ridiculous detail.

905
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,419
I'll hear the reason
why you're here later.

906
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,213
It's great that
the person in question is here.

907
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,882
Let's ask her directly.

908
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,092
Let's do that.

909
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:35,887
Make your choice.

910
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,641
Between the two of us,
whose liver will you accept?

911
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,435
Decide right here, right now!

912
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,854
Make your decision, Dr. Cha.

913
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,693
I'm not sure.

914
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,532
Whose liver should I accept?

915
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:22,976
I choose…

916
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,211
DOCTOR CHA

917
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,901
Please give me
the chance to save your life.

918
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:18,740
Even though I may not be
by your side one day,

919
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:22,160
I'll always protect you.

920
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:25,121
I'm scared I'll be causing
unnecessary suffering for someone

921
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,123
because of me.

922
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,416
I'll let you go through with the divorce

923
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,210
and I won't pathetically cling to you.

924
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,295
So get the surgery.

925
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,255
And live.

926
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:40,219
