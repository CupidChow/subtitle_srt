(Gymnasium)

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,030
It's time.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,760
I don't dare to check it. Do it for me.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,160
I'm so nervous.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,800
Why must you be nervous?

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,920
No reason for that.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,030
Failed?

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,150
I knew it.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,750
No.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,600
I mean the administration system failed.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,960
Could you not pause before you finish?

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,710
What a poor system!

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,320
It even crashes for score checking.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,880
I was addicted to games.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,150
But because of the poor Internet,

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,390
I gave up playing games.

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,520
It's too poor to be used.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,960
It's a pass!

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,430
Not at all. I haven't condemned it yet.

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,640
I mean Yanxin passed the exam.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,430
She barely passed it with 60 points.

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,400
Oh, no. I failed the exam.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,280
We're no longer embarrassed.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,230
Congratulations.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,480
Go away, you guys.

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,200
I failed the exam.

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,640
I got only 49 points.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,120
Cheers.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,790
We can prepare for the basketball game
without concern now.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,430
There's a huge difference
between our team members.

34
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,950
Xingqi is the top student
who gets scholarships.

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,400
But you often fail the exam.

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,920
That's why I asked him to coach me.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,800
By the way...

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Cheers.

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,840
A toast to you.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,030
You're a good teacher.

41
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,710
If I fail the exam again,
I'll still ask you for help.

42
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,280
Why can't you study hard by yourself?

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,960
Don't be numb.

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,680
She just wants to stay with you alone.

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,910
Don't talk nonsense.

46
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,590
I'm not talking nonsense.

47
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,120
Don't forget. I've got evidence.

48
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,960
What evidence? Show us.

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,120
Hurry.

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,000
When they were studying

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,560
in the biological herbarium,

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,590
they kissed.

53
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,680
They kissed?

54
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,560
How did they kiss?

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
Show us how they kissed.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,750
They just kissed directly.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,520
That was an accident.

58
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,000
You got close to each other so quickly?

(I'll give them a lesson.)

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
All right.

63
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,750
Stop asking about that.

64
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,840
Let's just drink.

65
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,870
Or play a game.

66
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,840
Right, right.

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
- Let's play a game.
- Come on.

68
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,150
How about Truth or Dare?

69
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,470
Okay. Come on.

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,430
A joker card is in it.

71
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,560
Whoever gets it

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,710
should play the game.

73
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Clear.

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,150
Who got the joker?

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,240
Who?

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,400
Truth or Dare?

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,870
- Truth. Truth.
- Truth. Truth.

78
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,680
Dare.

79
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,150
You're so quiet.

80
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,360
Boring.

81
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,590
Profess love to someone
among your contacts.

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,280
Whatever.

83
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,120
I can explain later, anyway.

84
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,430
Zhong Dahai, then.

85
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,520
You've topped his name.

86
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,910
He was our captain.

87
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,870
Right, right.

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,960
He has gone abroad.

89
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,030
His number must be out of service.

90
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,870
How do you know that before you try?

91
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,150
Just call him.

92
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,310
He won't answer, anyway.
