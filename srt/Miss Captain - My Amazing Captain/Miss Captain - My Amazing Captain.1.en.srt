is fighting desperately
for this year's championship.

Oops.

Only three seconds to go.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,670
There isn't much time left
for MDU Basketball Team.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,280
Dongshan Team seems
to be the champion again.

MDU Basketball Team got overtime

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,010
because of Zhong Dahai's buzzer beater.

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,870
Dude, changed your side again?

Yeah. Bravo.

Captain, the slogan doesn't sound right.

Just do it.

Just do it! Do it!

I'll go take a bath.
