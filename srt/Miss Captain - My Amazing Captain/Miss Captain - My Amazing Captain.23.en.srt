3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,240
Thank you for coming here with me again.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,110
I remember

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,870
when we were little,
it was hard to get the swing.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,670
I failed every time.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,830
Then you bribed

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,510
the kids on the swing with candy

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,480
so that they would give the seat to me.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,480
I did?

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,070
I don't even remember.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,790
Lu Xingqi.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,640
Thank you for being so nice to me.

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,880
No.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,790
If I had noticed your problem earlier,

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,520
you wouldn't have suffered.

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,470
When I moved here,

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,070
my parents just divorced.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,710
Back then,

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,280
I was quite solitary.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,670
My father even thought I was autistic.

22
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,350
Later,

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,590
I met you.

24
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,040
Hey, play on the swing with me.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,920
I never play such a babyish game.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,200
A kid mustn't lie.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,510
You love to play that.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,560
I don't.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,400
Come on. Go have fun with me.

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,950
Later,

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,950
I met you.

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,510
You pulled me out of the dark corner.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
However,

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,310
I failed to protect you.

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Shall we play basketball together?

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,150
No. We never play with girls.

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,120
My mother said

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,920
we shouldn't say she's a girl.

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,070
But she is a girl.

40
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,870
My mother asks me not to lie.

41
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not a girl.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,070
I'm not a girl.

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,760
Dahai!

44
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,510
When I realized you were sick,

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,360
I made up my mind

46
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,190
to protect you.

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,710
So,

48
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,520
since we were little,

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,520
you've been going
to the same school

50
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,430
just to keep me company?

51
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,120
Is it also why you major

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,430
in medical science?

53
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,800
I want you to live like normal people.

54
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,120
I don't want others
to have prejudices against you.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,910
Luckily,

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,960
Professor came up with a new therapy

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,840
to treat you.

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,150
Just

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,590
do it.

60
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,710
Just

61
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,840
do it.

62
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,360
Just do it! Do it!

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
We hypnotized you

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
so that you thought
you turned into a girl.

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,960
When we cooperate and act perfectly

66
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,000
to make you accept your female identity,

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,150
you're likely to be cured.

68
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,030
But we didn't expect

69
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,910
that you got to know the truth

70
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,710
under such circumstances.

71
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,710
It doesn't matter.

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
I think I'm cured.

73
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,240
What?

74
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,590
I've accepted my female identity.

75
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,080
And I've decided who I'll love.

76
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,460
