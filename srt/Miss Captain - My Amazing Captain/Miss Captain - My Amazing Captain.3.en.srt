00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,960
Come on, we're in a hurry.
Just get to the point.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,960
It's okay that you
lost the game yesterday.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,760
We still have a chance
for the last round.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,070
So, from this day on,

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,440
I'll take over the team as the manager.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,030
Humph.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,480
If you stay, you can get this.

12

Are you exercising, too?

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
The game will start soon.
We must be well trained.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,480
Let's exercise together.

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,240
Come on.

16
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,150
There's one month before the game.

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,600
I'll find an excellent scorer
within this month

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,200
to replace me...

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,110
To replace Zhong Dahai, I mean.

20
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,150

Manager, tell us how to find this guy.

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,710
(A colossal sum of money)
I've got somebody in my mind.

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,390
Manager,

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,470
let me make it clear first.

27
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,240
Whether we win or lose the game,

28
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,420
I won't give the money back to you.

Thank you, manager.

As far as I know Lu Xingqi,

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,150
he's either studying

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,710
or going to study.

34
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,590
Lu Xingqi.

35
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,070
Hee-hee.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,920
In the middle of something?

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,760
Haw-haw.

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,640
Look.

39
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,920
You breathe calmly.

40
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,950
And you've got long fingers.

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,510
What a waste
if you don't shoot at the basket!

42
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,040
Wow.

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,950
Look at your long legs.

44
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,150
What a waste

45
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,710
if you don't make a dunk shot!

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,120
What on earth do you want?

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,430
Me?

48
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,920
Well, I don't want anything big.

49
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,360
But yes, I want something.

50
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,080
Would you like to join
our basketball team?

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
No way.

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
Why? You play basketball
very well, don't you?

53
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,080
How do you know that?

54
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,310
I...

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,080
I'm a fan of yours.

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
I watched you play basketball.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,150
So what?

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,000
If you don't join us, I will...

59
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,470
I will yell for help.

60
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,280
Help! Help!

61
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,520
What are you doing?
