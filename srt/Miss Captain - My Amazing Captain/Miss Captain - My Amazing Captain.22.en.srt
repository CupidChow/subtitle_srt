3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,390
Dad.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,230
You're back?

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,350
I'm glad you're back.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,160
Oh, you're wounded?

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,760
Does it hurt?

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,150
It definitely hurts.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,150
But you've never cried
for pain since little.

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,350
Any better?

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,070
You knew about the therapy, right?

12
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,920
It's my bad.

13
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,590
If I...

14
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,760
If I hadn't been that stubborn,

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,680
you wouldn't be sick now.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
I should have protected you.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,150
At that time,

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,480
I was eager to win
the basketball championship

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,640
so that I could be
a professional basketball player.

20
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,760
However,

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,200
my dream didn't come true.

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,840
I even selfishly believed

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
that I could pin my hope on you.

24
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,790
(The Second Runner-up)
If only I had a son!

25
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,710
Why do I only have a weak daughter?

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,920
Dahai?

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
Dahai.

28
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,740
(The Best Defensive Player)

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,280
Gradually,

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,630
you suffered from paranoia.

31
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,750
(Men)
You thought you were a boy.

32
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,310
Every time someone
uncovered this secret,

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,310
you would be greatly stimulated.

34
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,080
Shall we play basketball together?

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,750
No. We never play with girls.

36
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,470
I'm not a girl.

37
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,630
Your teachers and classmates

38
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,840
acquiesce in your "gender transition".

39
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,910
They've been keeping this secret.

40
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,050
It's my bad.

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,680
You shouldn't have suffered like this.

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,840
It's all my bad.

43
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,150
Dad.

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,800
Dad.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,680
It's not your fault.

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Over the years,

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,150
you must have been living a hard life

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
to keep this secret.

49
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,560
It's all my bad.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,520
I never realized until now

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,240
that no dream could be
as important as you.

52
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,120
Dad.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,560
It's just my fault.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,800
What's gone is gone.

55
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,560
Let's start all over again,

56
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,430
shall we?

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,840
Thank you.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,030
Lu Xingqi?

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,430
Lu Xingqi, can you go with me
to where we used to go?

60
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
