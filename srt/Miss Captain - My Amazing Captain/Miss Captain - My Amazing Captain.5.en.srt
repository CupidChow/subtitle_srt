He's so dawdling.

I hear our basketball team
lost the game.

Zhong Dahai, huh?

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,190
He plays basketball poorly.
He's ugly and likes to make trouble.

You're ugly!
Everyone in your family is ugly.

How can I live in the girls' dorm?
No, no.

Bro, you have to get along
with girls more often

so that you can behave like a girl.

I can't. Or I would blow my secret.
