00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,900
(Gymnasium)

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,190
Lu Xingqi.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,440
Your birthday is coming up.
I bought a present for you.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,510
Hope you'll like it.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,390
Sorry,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,070
but I can't accept it.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,760
Why?

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,230
It's a limited-edition jersey.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,120
It's not about what it is.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,150
You're Dahai's girlfriend.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,350
We should keep our distance.

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,350
I shouldn't accept
such a valuable present, either.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,240
Pretend it's from Dahai and me, okay?

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,560
Pretend?

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,000
So, Dahai doesn't know about this, huh?

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,070
Let's not contact each other
unless we have to.

19
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,840
You'd better stop doing anything
that'll make Dahai misunderstand us.

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,790
So, without Zhong Dahai,

21
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,430
would he accept my present?

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,940
(Player Entrance)

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,590
The therapy works very smoothly.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,680
Professor,

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,070
she's starting to sway.

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,070
(Gymnasium)
She gradually accepts the female identity.

27
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,040
Very good.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,560
This is a rare disease.

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,310
My therapy for her is very risky, too.

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,920
Everyone around her has to cooperate

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,150
so that she can slowly
accept her new identity.

32
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,430
If we suddenly told her the truth,

33
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,150
the consequences might be terrible.

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,560
All right, Professor.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,040
As long as she can be cured,

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,120
we'll all cooperate.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,000
(Why do I bother so much
about Lu Xingqi?)

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,870
(And I just thought
Zhong Dahai was in my way.)

39
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,950
(But Zhong Dahai is the real me.)

40
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,280
(Do I...)

41
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,230
(Wait.)

42
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,520
(Why am I using the girl's voice?)

43
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,470
(Test, test.)

44
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,190
(I'm a real man.)

45
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,430
(I've even lost
my last male characteristic.)

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,960
(Why am I behaving more like a girl?)

47
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,400
Yanxin?

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,750
Why haven't you gone to the gym again?

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,240
(Keep a clear head.)

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,430
(You love cute girls like Jiang Yue,)

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,630
(instead of naughty guys like yourself.)

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,960
What are you staring at me for?

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,870
Nothing.

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,910
(I don't even have a crush on Jiang Yue.
Oh, I'm doomed.)

55
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,870
Yanxin, do you not go to the gym
because you're avoiding Lu Xingqi?

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,800
No. I just don't feel very well.

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,190
Don't lie. I saw what happened
when you gave the present to him.

58
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,280
You must have been sad
when he rejected your present.

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
He hates me, I guess.

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
You're so numb.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,560
In my eyes, you and he like each other.

62
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Don't talk nonsense.

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,870
Lu Xingqi didn't
keep his distance from you

64
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,710
until he knew
you were Zhong Dahai's girlfriend.

65
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,750
And you still don't know
you've fallen in love with Lu Xingqi.

66
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,680
I haven't.

67
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,970
In my opinion, Zhong Dahai is
the only obstruction

68
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,120
between you and Lu Xingqi.

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,710
Lu Xingqi thinks he shouldn't like
the girlfriend of his best friend.

70
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,360
And you think you emotionally
cheat on Zhong Dahai

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,750
who is Lu Xingqi's best friend.

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,030
You and Lu Xingqi are just
too virtuous and principled.

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,870
But I kind of suspect
your love for Zhong Dahai.

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,680
You've never talked about him

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,080
or contacted him.

76
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,560
Even if it's a long-distance relationship,
you'll break up, huh?

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,680
(Because I'm Zhong Dahai.)

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
As far as I see,

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,590
you and Zhong Dahai no longer
have feelings for each other.

80
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,870
Why don't you keep a clear head
and follow your heart?

81
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Follow my heart?

82
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,310
I'm not encouraging you

83
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,880
because I want to see two guys

84
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,400
fall out and fight for you.

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,800
I think you are.

86
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,190
Nonsense. I really think
Lu Xingqi is a good guy.

87
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,960
He deserves to be the love of your life.

88
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,870
He does?

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,630
(Being good buddies with him for years,
I'm very aware of that.)

90
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,240
You know what? When you didn't
go to the gym these days,

91
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,310
he was practicing very hard.

92
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,080
I remember he didn't
play basketball before, right?

93
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,360
Then who is he playing basketball for?

94
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,720
Well, it's just my opinion.

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,630
You make your own decision.

96
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,120
I...

97
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,750
I'm worried about something.

98
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,270
About Zhong Dahai, right?

99
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,920
But good. You've taken the first step,

100
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,390
starting to face your real feelings.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,480
Then...

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,270
Shall I have a word with Lu Xingqi?

103
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,360
Exactly. You finally begin
to do the right thing.

104
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,120
Thank you.

105
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,360
I've never talked with others before.

106
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,190
You're welcome. We're friends.

107
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
