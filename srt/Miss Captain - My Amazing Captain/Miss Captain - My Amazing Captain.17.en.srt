=Episode 17=

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,110
(Sorry I haven't told you until now.)

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,830
(Right.)

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,270
(Yanxin is indeed my girlfriend.)

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,160
(When I'm away,)

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,000
(take good care of her for me.)

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,870
(How did you get into a relationship?)

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,190
(Tell the truth.)

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm single.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,830
How can I make up a love story?

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,840
(It was a sunny day.)

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,920
(I saw a lovely girl by the seaside.)

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,070
(She had beautiful eyelashes)

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,920
(and the smell of rosemary.)

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,700
(I plucked up my courage to buy her...)

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,320
Malt sugar.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,280
Sent.

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,880
(Why does the story sound so familiar?)

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,030
(It does?)

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,710
(This is how sweet love usually starts.)

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,870
It's so hard for me.

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,070
He believed me, I guess.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,000
Lu Xingqi.

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,150
Lu Xingqi!

26
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,280
Lu Xingqi.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,680
There you are, manager.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Lu Xingqi.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,790
It's so sweet of you. Thanks.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,680
Fine, then. Hope you'll choke.

31
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,950
Lu Xingqi, how dare you ignore me!

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,070
I can't let this continue.

33
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,230
His birthday is just a few days away.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,070
Shall I buy him a present

35
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,030
to mend our relationship?

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,840
Feel free to browse.

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,240
A superb choice, miss.

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,800
It's the throwback jersey
Marbury wore during his rookie year.

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
It's the only one that can be found now.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,030
How much is it?

41
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,280
We're having a special offer.

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,310
2,888 yuan.

43
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,560
It's for a good omen.

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,000
Good omen.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,590
(Oh, no. I've spent all my money
on the basketball team.)

46
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,030
Hello, Jiang Yue.

47
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,910
Yanxin, Yanxin.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,960
I've got good news.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,080
Go ahead.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,030
I reached the final
of the Fashion Design Competition.

51
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,590
A music video will be made
for promotion.

52
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,750
Be my actress.

53
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,630
No way.

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,400
I won't.

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
Come on. You'll get double pay.

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,630
Come and help me.

57
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,710
Let me make it clear first.

58
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,360
I charge quite a lot.

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,430
No problem.

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,430
Darn it.

61
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,430
I don't know what is going to happen.

62
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
