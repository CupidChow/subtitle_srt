3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,030
Let's look for her separately.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,160
Okay.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,420
(Player Entrance)

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,440
Did you see Zhong Yanxin?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,960
Didn't she go to see you on the rooftop?
What happened?

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,160
The therapy thing was exposed.
She's gone.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,510
How would you let her know that?

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,830
What do we do, then?

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,070
I'll go look for her.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,350
We'll go, too.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,960
What did I say? You overacted.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,280
It's none of my business.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,070
I used to be a part-time actor.

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,390
It must be Adao's fault.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,150
You wrote such ridiculous dialogues.

18
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,030
Normal people don't talk like that.

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,070
All right. Stop arguing.

20
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,880
Let's go look for Yanxin.

21
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,840
Go.

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,520
I acted the best.

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,150
Excuse me,

24
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,110
did you see the girl
who once came with me?

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,000
She came the other day
and bought a jersey.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,750
What? Quarreled with your girlfriend?

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,030
Thank you.

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,640
Hello, Ye Ran.

29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello, Jiang Yue.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,400
Is Yanxin back in the dorm?

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,560
No. What happened?

32
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,920
She knew we all lied to her
about the therapy thing.

33
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,560
And she's missing now.

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,840
How did this happen?

35
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,680
Where are you? I'll come and help.

36
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,230
- Zhong Yanxin.
- Zhong Yanxin.

37
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,150
Jiang Yue, what happened?

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,120
I think I sprained my ankle.

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,950
It's okay. Leave me alone.

40
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,280
Keep looking for Yanxin.

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,430
How can I leave you alone?

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,920
Come on. Let me carry you.

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,760
Don't bother.

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,280
Just listen. Come on.

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,760
Hurry.

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,040
Zhong Yanxin.

47
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,560
Zhong Yanxin, where are you?

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,790
Don't scare me.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,240
Hello, Mr. Zhong. It's me.

50
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,800
She happened to know
her female identity.

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,680
We don't know what she will do.

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,310
Professor can't predict the risks
of the new therapy, either.

53
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,680
If she goes back home,

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,400
do let me know.

55
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,310
(How come?)

56
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,280
(So, I'm indeed a girl?)

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
(Then what I've been doing
turns out to be a big joke, huh?)

58
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,710
(Good buddies? Besties?
They can't be real.)

59
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,520
(Every one of them
has been lying to me.)

60
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,630
(Lu Xingqi, Ye Ran, Jiang Yue,
and the basketball team.)

61
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,680
(Even my father has been lying.)

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,870
Why? Why?

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,310
Why does everybody lie to me?

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,900
