3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,320
How shall I start the conversation?

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,670
Lu Xingqi, shall we have a word?

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,830
No, no.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,160
Lu Xingqi,

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,390
Zhong Dahai is me.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,510
I am Zhong Dahai.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,480
That's too direct.
I'll sound like a psychopath.

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,160
Shall I go have a try?

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,440
Whatever.

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,780
(Player Entrance)

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,240
Where's Lu Xingqi?

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,390
Manager!

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,560
Manager,

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,070
you're back, at last.

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,790
Lu Xingqi has been training us
with no mercy.

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,600
He's even crueler than a devil.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
I just wonder

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,750
if we can get more money.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,750
When you gave us that red packet,
you didn't say we would suffer so much.

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,790
All right.

23
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,600
Where's Lu Xingqi?

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,790
On the rooftop.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,560
Okay.

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,920
Manager, remember to transfer the money.

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,920
What do you want me for?

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,710
Zhong Yanxin hasn't come
to the gym for days.

29
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,510
I know that.

30
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,790
Was your therapy going so quickly

31
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,590
that the plan backfired?

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,070
Therapy?

33
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,590
What therapy?

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,150
I think the therapy goes very slowly

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,280
and we need some stimulation.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,200
Do you mean hurting her outrageously?

37
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,400
I would never hurt her.

38
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,430
When Zhong Dahai mistakenly
believed the gender transition,

39
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,590
you asked us to cooperate
with Professor Mo's therapy

40
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,040
so that she would realize
she was indeed a girl.

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,640
But now you personally decide
to quicken the progress.

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,000
What are they talking about?

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,280
I think the therapy is going smoothly.

44
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,950
She's distressed

45
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,310
and it means she's gradually awakening
from her gender cognition.

46
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,480
If I knew you didn't care
about her feelings,

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,950
I would be the guy to stimulate her.

48
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,920
How much do you really care about her?

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,430
To you,

50
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,520
she's just a research subject.

51
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,120
Wrong.

52
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,080
So, after getting along with her
for days,

53
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,000
you've got feelings for her?

54
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,960
Yes, so what?

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,120
I feel sorry for her now.

56
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,680
Everyone is cooperating with you,

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,000
including Jiang Yue, other members
of the basketball team, and me.

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,120
Only she's kept in the dark.

59
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,750
I'm still confused

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,360
if it was right
to let you use this therapy.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,560
Oh, no.

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,860
