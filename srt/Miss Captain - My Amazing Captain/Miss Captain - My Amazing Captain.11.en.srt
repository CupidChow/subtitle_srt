Come on! Come on!

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
Got it. Watch this.

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,870
Lu Xingqi is cool. He's charming.
Come on, Lu Xingqi!

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,110
Seriously?

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,150
Why is he handsome
when tying his shoelaces?

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,110
One more time.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,240
Ah!

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,920
My ankle!

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,430
What happened?

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,450
- It hurts.
- What's wrong?

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,350
What happened?

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,710
- Where were you hurt?
- Here.

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,840
Ah!

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,960
Take him to the clinic immediately.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,350
- Come on.
- Hurry.

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,960
Get up.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,520
Be careful.

(Gymnasium)

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,560
According to the school doctor,

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,070
Adao's ankle must be plastered up.

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,590
He can't play basketball
for the following three months.

25
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,710
What do we do, then?

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,710
When we don't even have
the minimum number of players,

27
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,560
we'll be disqualified for the game.

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,070
We won't.

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,640
I'll find a new player.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,590
The game will start in only a few days.

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,070
Xingqi is already a new player.

32
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,040
We haven't cooperated well with him yet.
Another new player?

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,120
Even if we play in the game,
we'll certainly lose.

34
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,950
Why not give up?

35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,150
Let's do it next year
when Captain is back.

36
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,920
We can wait until next year, anyway.

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's just quit.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,590
No way.

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,480
I'll handle the cooperation thing.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,590
I'll go find a new player, too.

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,230
When you find one,

42
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,510
the game will be over.

43
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,150
Look, here's a new player.

44
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,480
Why are you staring at me?

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm even confused when watching a ball game.
How can I play basketball?

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,950
Come on, Ye Ran.

47
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,510
Help me please, will you?

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,870
He can't do it.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,630
Well, only you can.
You're the best, okay?

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,190
I just need to shoot at the basket, huh?

51
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,800
Pass the ball to me.

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,190
We'd better wait until next year.

53
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,710
Yeah. Let's just wait.

54
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,280
What was he doing?

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,910
Let's not go and disgrace ourselves.

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,470
Who said I couldn't do it?

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,400
You, huh?

58
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,870
Dude, don't flatter yourself.

59
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,710
You walked with the ball.

60
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,800
Don't think I watched little
about basketball.

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,030
In NBA games, a player just did that.

62
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,430
I think you're satirizing someone

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,190
but I just don't have any evidence.

64
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,400
Shall we just disband our team?

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,590
Don't. Don't.

66
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,080
I'll train him until he can play.

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Goodbye.

68
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,060

Oh, okay.

Be more careful.

Let me teach you instead.

I'm doing it very well.

81
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,910
Are you good enough to teach me?

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,560
I'm good enough
to teach a beginner like you.

You aren't a professional player,
either.

84

Can't a beginner become experienced?

Come on.

I can't be too relieved.

Get hyper.

92
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,000
Go. Let's continue the training.
