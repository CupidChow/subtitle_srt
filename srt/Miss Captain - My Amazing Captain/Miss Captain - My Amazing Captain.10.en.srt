Good shot.

Lu Xingqi is so handsome.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,600
One day, you'll realize

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,280
that he isn't a good guy.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,640
Look. No filter.

He's indeed charming.

Use it up if you can.

Take photos of Lu Xingqi only.

No photos of anyone else.

Good. You play as well as before.

20
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's discuss the tactics.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,600
Did you get the hang of the tactics?

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,590
Xingqi, you're indeed
a genius of tactics.

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,120
You thought of the pick-and-roll.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,480
I've never even heard about it.

25
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,040
Yes, I got it.

26

What? He's good, huh?

27

Mm.

28

Wait a minute.

29
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm confused.

30

What's the sequence?

Who goes after another?

Wait, wait.

33
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,480
You don't play on the court anyway.

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,920
It's okay if you don't understand.

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,400
You're right.

you know...

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,120
It's also tiring to stay off the court.

39
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,840
If possible, could you
dance in the uniform?

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,510
What do you think?

41
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,710
- Right, right.
- Good idea.

Oh.

Wow, that's Lu Xingqi.

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,750
He looks more handsome
than that in the photo.

50
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,310
- You're right.
- Go, go, go.

I'm an Aquarius.
We make a perfect match.

Sorry,

53
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,800
but I have to go for the training.

What did I say?

Lu Xingqi is super cool.

- Right, right.
- Go, go, go.
