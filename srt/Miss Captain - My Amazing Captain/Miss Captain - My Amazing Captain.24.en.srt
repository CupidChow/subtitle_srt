=Episode 24=

3
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,190
What are you doing?

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,390
Taking a photo
to tell everyone about this.

5
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,190
From this moment on,

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,200
we're no longer good buddies,

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,350
but a sweet couple.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,150
What kind of buddies kiss each other?

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,560
Oh, wait.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,840
Umm...

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,750
When I thought I was a boy,

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,030
did I look like an idiot in your eyes?

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,670
What did Jiang Yue think of me?

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,390
Silly,

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
don't overthink.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,710
From now on,

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,710
just be my girlfriend
and worry about nothing.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,500
(Gymnasium)

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,590
Lu Xingqi said
he had found Zhong Yanxin.

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,200
Problem solved.

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,430
But he didn't say how Yanxin was now.

22
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,950
Does he not tell us

23
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,760
because she's getting worse?

24
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't think
Zhong Yanxin is that fragile.

25
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,710
Right.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,070
Captain is always positive.

27
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,920
I believe she'll pull through.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,120
But after all the trouble,
she would finally accept herself bravely.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,230
Now she suddenly got to know the truth.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,710
No one could accept that calmly.

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,510
We're back.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,070
Yanxin,

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,230
are you all right?

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,230
Yes. Sorry to have kept you worried.

35
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,480
You two...

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,950
This is my girlfriend.

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
You're already in a relationship?

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Thank you

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,800
for always enlightening me.

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,870
Not at all.

41
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,240
All right.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,710
We no longer need to act.

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
She's still your captain, Zhong Dahai.

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,280
She's also my girlfriend, Zhong Yanxin.

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,680
Eh...

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,360
Now that we no longer need to act,

47
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,400
we've got a little question.

48
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,630
That is...

49
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,680
Captain,

50
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,800
will Shasha still come
and do the cheerleading for us?

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,710
Hee-hee.

52
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,520
There's no time to lose.
The final is coming.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,360
Stop thinking about girls.

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,800
Wow.

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,030
Congratulations.

56
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,800
Hope you'll be nice to her.

57
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,310
Or I'll...

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,470
I will.

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,630
Here comes the clutch time.

60
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,560
Lu Xingqi of Mingde University
is doing the free throw.

61
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,910
It's the last strike.

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,280
(Everyone has countless identities,)

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
(but only one ego.)

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,150
(Instead of getting stuck
in others' opinions or expectations,)

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,870
(we should be reconciled with ourselves)

66
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,150
(and accept who we really are.)

67
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,910
(Only when we get back the sincerity,)

68
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,560
(bravery,)

69
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,590
(and enthusiasm)

70
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,710
(will we not waste)

71
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,400
(our vigorous youth.)

72
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,740
