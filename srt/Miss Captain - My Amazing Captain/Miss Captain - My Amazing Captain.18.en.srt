3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,270
This dress is way too revealing.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,160
It isn't. It looks great.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,510
Do girls all wear like this?

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,830
You mustn't question my design.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,510
Tuck your pelvis. Square your shoulders.

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,480
Mm. Nice.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,670
It's my first time to act. I'm nervous.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,190
Don't be nervous.
There are no strangers.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,760
You know the leading actor, too.

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,920
Are you sure?

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Who's he?

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,750
Here he comes.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,280
Why is it him?

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,560
It's me.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,920
You must have been expecting.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,880
We've been waiting, actually.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,150
Let's go.

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,680
Hurry.

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,150
- I'm nervous.
- Don't be nervous.

22
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,070
Director.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,560
Hello, director.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,470
Here. Scripts for you.

25
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,320
In the first scene, you'll kiss.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,430
Kiss? In the first scene?

27
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,200
You have no idea. Idol dramas these days

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,590
can't do without kisses.

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,790
I don't understand
why people love to watch that.

30
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,350
I really don't understand.

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,350
Come. Let's get started.

32
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,950
Come on. I trust you.

33
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,150
Everybody, get ready.

34
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,590
Three, two, one.

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,200
Action.

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,040
No matter who you become,

37
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,350
I'll still love you.

38
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,840
Good!

39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,120
Good take.

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,840
Very good.

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,510
Pass. Let's get to another scene.

42
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,200
So soon?

43
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,000
Is your encouragement still valid?

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,190
Atishoo.

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Sorry.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,150
Are you all right?

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,430
The director asked us
to get to another scene.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,710
Luckily, he failed to kiss me.

49
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,030
Another scene, fine.

50
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,630
Babe, you did a great job.

51
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,560
The director said the video was good
and he would hire you next time.

52
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,190
No problem.

53
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,800
So much money?

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,750
Of course.

55
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,470
If next time I wear
a more revealing dress,

56
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,310
can I get higher pay?

57
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,470
Don't talk nonsense.
We're a serious team.

58
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,080
Serious?

59
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,590
Look at the director.

60
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,710
He doesn't look serious at all.

61
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't be ridiculous.

62
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,310
I'm in a hurry. I should go.

63
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,470
Where are you going?

64
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,590
Marbury?

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,960
You want to buy it?

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,960
Cash?

67
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,520
Pack...

68
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,800
- I'll pack it up for you?
- Yes, yes.

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,080
You're in such a hurry.
You must be buying it for your boyfriend.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,870
I'm on it.

71
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,260
