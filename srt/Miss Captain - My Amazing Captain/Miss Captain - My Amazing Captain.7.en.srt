3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,270
Girl.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,270
Who hit me?

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,510
I did.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,070
Xingqi?

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,070
Lu Xingqi?

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,120
The contest isn't over yet.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,830
Why do you think you won?

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,670
Right.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,790
It's not over yet.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,000
That's not what you just said.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,030
You said ten shots, right?

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,200
We reserve all the rights
for the final explanation.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,150
Let's have a one-on-one game.

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,880
Fine, then.

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,880
Girl,

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,280
wait for me.

19
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,600
Xingqi, defeat him!

20
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,600
Beat him!

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm never scared of a weak man like you.

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,000
Bring it on.

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,840
Start.

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,210
He's awesome.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,480
Come on.

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,200
Give me pressure and make me sweat.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,920
You defended so poorly.

28
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,840
Here. The second shot.

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,680
Play more seriously.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,040
Again.

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,920
You couldn't even hold the ball.

32
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,120
So weak.

33
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,150
You must have a disease.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
If you want to see a doctor, come to me.

35
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,480
One more time!

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,560
What a poor feint!

37
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,710
Wow.

38
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,040
He's so fast.

39
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,510
How did he shoot?

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,310
I didn't see that.

41
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,000
You cheated, huh?

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,400
I guess you've got
a disordered nervous system, too.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,960
So unresponsive.

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
One more time.

45
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,750
One more time.

46
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,710
I'm in a hurry. I'll end it.

47
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,030
Wait and see.

48
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,520
Yeah.

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,800
Xingqi.

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,630
I knew you would come.

51
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,960
We can play basketball together again.

52
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,590
This is so great.

53
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,560
Did I agree
to join your basketball team?

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,870
What? Are you fooling me?

55
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,520
Am I helping you or fooling you?

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,870
Don't you know?

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,080
I don't care.

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
According to the rule,

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,560
after you win the game,
you have to join our team.

60
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,910
You have to date me, too.

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,360
What if I reject you?

62
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,960
You mustn't reject me.

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,360
People are watching. Don't disgrace me.

64
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,150
You can't leave this court

65
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,520
unless you step over me.

66
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,960
What are you doing?

67
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,590
Okay, then.

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,580
