3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,920
Oops.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,390
Why is my phone ringing?

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,000
(Oh, no. Why did I take this phone out?)

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,350
Don't forget to bring your phone.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,960
Oh, right.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,710
Are you done? Ye Ran is rushing us.

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,430
Be right there.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,390
Just a crank call.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,880
(The subscriber you dialed is busy now.)

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,670
(Please redial later.)

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,150
Let me try again.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,030
Crank calls never stop.

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,470
(The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.)

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,120
Why are you keeping

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,510
Zhong Dahai's phone?

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,680
Because...

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,120
That phone is...

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,950
Well, well.

21
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,000
Now that

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,070
you saw this,

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,870
I'll no longer keep it from you.

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,680
Because I am Zhong Dahai...

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,400
...Zhong Dahai's girlfriend.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,000
He...

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,150
He had left his phone to me
before he went abroad.

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,350
But Dahai has never told me about you.

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,230
Oh.

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,840
Because...

31
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,760
Because you're single.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,350
He didn't want you to feel sad

33
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,590
because he had a girlfriend first.

34
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,070
So, he didn't tell you about me.

35
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,350
No wonder you care so much
about our basketball team.

36
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,870
So it's for Captain's dream?

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,200
That's right, Adao.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,920
You've learned to answer before I ask.

39
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,120
No wonder Dahai often compliments you

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,070
as the smartest guy of the team.

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,200
But,

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,920
he often says I'm stupid.

43
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,560
He says that to inspire you.

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,510
Inspire me?

45
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,350
Right.

46
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,120
I wanted to ship you and Lu Xingqi.

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't do that.

48
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,050
Dahai's buddy is my buddy, too.

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,120
Will you really not consider
being in a relationship with Lu Xingqi?

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,630
Zhong Dahai doesn't sound like

51
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,910
a good name for a handsome guy.

52
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,430
Dahai is quite handsome.

53
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,120
Right?

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,280
Is he handsome?

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,280
Yes!

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,840
Handsome!

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,000
He's quite handsome. Cheers.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,920
To Dahai.

59
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
Lu Xingqi.

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,520
Lu Xingqi!

61
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,430
What?

62
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,000
Do you blame me
for keeping that from you?

63
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,360
No.

64
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,870
Dahai always treats you
as his best friend.

65
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,080
He cares about you all the time.

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
I know that.

67
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,430
The car has come to pick me up.

68
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,870
I should go.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,800
But...

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Oh, no.

71
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,560
What should I do?

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,840
Come on, Zhong Dahai.

73
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,870
I didn't expect you
to tell such a funny lie.

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,910
I'll see how you can make it plausible.
