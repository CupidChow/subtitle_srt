Xingqi, let me explain.

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,080
Xingqi, slow down.
Why are you going that fast?

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,830
Xingqi.

00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,750
Lu Xingqi!

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,430
Come on, Xingqi.

(He doesn't even remember
our signboard gesture?)

This.

00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,710
Miss,

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,350
you'd better have a checkup
in the psychiatry department.

Xingqi...

16

(This guy is Lu Xingqi.
We've been good friends since little.)

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,680
(He's handsome,
but he keeps his distance from girls.)

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,950
(The poker face
accords with his persona.)

19
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,200

(Annoying.)

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,400
(Why do I feel I had a crush on him?)

(No, no, no. I have to
turn back into a boy.)

(This morning, I became a girl
when I was taking a bath.)

(After I take another bath,
I'll be a boy again, huh?)

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,590
(Oh, my teammates.)

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,760
When I'm away,
they're still practicing carefully.

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,640
They're indeed my good players.

37

Pass it to me.

Come on.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,950
I bought the ball. I'll take it away.

- Let's check the receipt. Come on.
- All right, then.

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,520
What a waste

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,030
to throw it away!

44
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,560
It can be used as a rag.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,120
There's no hope.
We'll join Dongshan Team.

What's this?

47

What are you guys doing?

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
What are you doing?

There you are, beauty.

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,000
Why are you disbanding?

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,910
We lost the game.
Why shall we still stay?

52
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,800
You just lost a game,

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,680
instead of being out.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,030
You can win the next game.

55
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,910
Right.

56
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,120
Right what? Our captain is gone.
How shall we continue?

57
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,400
What did I say?
The slogan didn't sound right.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Oh, no. We're doomed.

59

You mustn't leave.

Your team mustn't disband.

Girl, you're weird.

63
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,150
What does it have to do with you?

64
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,750
I...

65
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,630
I'm your new team manager.
