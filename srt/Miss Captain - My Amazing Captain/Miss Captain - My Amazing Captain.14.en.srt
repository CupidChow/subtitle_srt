3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,830
Mr. Lu, let's get started.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,480
Finish this paper
and let me know what you can do.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,230
All right.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,960
I love the feeling of suffocation.

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,160
Come on.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,920
Done.

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,700
Genius.

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,220
You flatter me.

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,770
Wrong answers
for all multiple-choice questions.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,850
If you chose C for all questions,
three of them would be right.

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,620
It was just too careless of me.

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,700
Here. Work out this problem.

15
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,290
A.

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,380
Wrong.

17
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,570
Wrong?

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:11,980
B.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,570
Wrong.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
C, then.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,400
D, actually.

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,640
Remember.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,150
The most unlikely answer

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,950
would be the correct one.

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,400
Also, the most unlikely guy

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,710
might be your Mr. Right.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,950
Kiss.

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,230
Kiss.

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,230
Do you get it?

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Oh.

31
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,920
I get it.

32
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,070
That's all for today.

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
Do as I taught you

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,590
and you'll pass the exam.

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,480
Wait.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,070
You haven't taught me
to write a composition yet.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
By the way,

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,680
leave the composition part blank

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,910
to get some points.

40
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,360
Ah?

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
But why?

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,990
Or your low intelligence
would be exposed.

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,710
Lu Xingqi, what are you talking about?

44
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,230
Who are you satirizing?

45
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,710
I'm just telling the truth.

46
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,990
Hey.

47
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,430
I always think of you as my good buddy,

48
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,880
but you don't have any confidence in me?

49
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,770
No, I don't.

50
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,180
Come on, this isn't over.

51
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,980
Hey, stop it.

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,560
You...

53
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,190
Anybody there?

54
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,840
Here it goes again.

55
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,280
Students these days

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
don't turn off the light
or lock the door.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,560
Hey.

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,000
Was it shaking just now?

59
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,750
Yes, I guess.

60
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,360
The skeleton has come back to life!

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,190
Go with me.

62
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,120
Hurry. Hurry.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,590
Go with me.

64
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,520
Ah!

65
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,910
Zhong Yanxin.

66
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,470
Ah! Don't run after me. Go after him.

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,710
It's me.

68
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,660
