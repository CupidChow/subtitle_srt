Episode 36
Broken Table

4
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,620
You're leaving?

5
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,800
Yes.

6
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,720
Why?

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,770
Why...?

8
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,510
Is it because ... I talked about getting married?

9
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,990
Don't say ... Is it really that?

10
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,850
Let's talk about it next time.

11
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,390
Let's go. It's cold.

12
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,630
♫ I can't carelessly reach it​ ♫

13
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,540
♫ I want to smile for you ♫

14
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,580
♫ I want our eyes to meet again​ ♫

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,000
♫ Is today a day I miss you so much ♫

16
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,900
Did we do something wrong? Look at Yumi's face.

17
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,350
- I think things keep getting twisted.
- What?

18
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,050
That's not what he means...

19
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,730
Then what do you want to do?

20
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,860
What should we do?

21
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,530
♫ before we get further apart ♫

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,460
♫ Over my pillow our beautiful times​ ♫

23
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:23,290
♫ keep falling ♫

24
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,400
Should we wait for her here?

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,960
If he tells her honestly how he feels...

26
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,280
It would be really embarrassing but I don't want her to misunderstand.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,250
- No, I don't think that'll be possible.
- Why not?

28
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,690
I'm sorry but our priority number one is always

29
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,340
3. Mother, 2. Yumi, 1. Gu Wung

30
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,220
Wung.

31
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:52,940
♫ I am afraid of hurting you so I'll squeeze through the gap​ ♫

32
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,680
♫ Cutting through my disappointment ♫

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,150
- Yumi—
- We can't say something that'll hurt Wung's pride.

34
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,600
♫ Actually I don't know any more​ ♫

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,550
♫ I hope you'll smile for me ♫

36
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,560
♫ If you meet my eyes first ♫

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,220
♫ Is today a day​ ♫

38
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,740
♫ I want you to miss me so much? ♫

39
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,490
♫ Like an awkward confession ♫

40
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:34,710
♫ I want to be comforted ♫

41
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,410
♫ When can I go to you? ♫

42
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,560
♫ I want to smile for you ♫

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,490
♫ I want our eyes to meet again​ ♫

44
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,210
♫ Today again, after a long time ♫

45
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,660
♫ I was looking forward to your heart ♫

46
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,570
♫ It finally returned ♫

47
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,530
♫ I want to hang onto you​ ♫

48
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,560
♫ Before we get farther apart ♫

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,560
♫ On top of my pillow ♫

50
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,730
♫ our beautiful times ♫

51
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:35,920
♫ keep falling ♫

52
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,960
Yumi, I'm leaving now.

53
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,020
I'll leave the house key on the table.

54
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,220
- Assistant Manager Yumi.
- Yes.

55
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,320
Let's talk in the conference room.

56
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,020
Sure.

57
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,020
Wung, I have to go to a meeting right now.

58
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,530
I'll call you later.

59
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,690
Writing pleasantly is your forte.

60
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,660
This one is a little too stiff, right?

61
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,220
Yes, just a bit.

62
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,440
I'll make it light and try again.

63
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,970
Could something be going on?

64
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,100
No, nothing's going on.

65
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,580
But you've been down these past few days.

66
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,560
Maybe because the concept this time is a bit hard.

67
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,810
This is how I always look when I can't write well.

68
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,160
Then should we modify the concept a bit?

69
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,170
No need. It's just because my skills are lacking.

70
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,150
It's all right. I'll figure something out.

71
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,190
Assistant Manager Yumi, I got a message from S&C saying that they got the mail without the attached file.

72
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,830
- Really?
- Yes.

73
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,840
I must've missed it. Oh no.

74
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,860
Excuse me.

75
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,020
What the?

76
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,590
Okay.

77
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,700
What? Did it break?

78
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,600
Then do you exercise at the park?

79
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,660
The weather's nice now so I've started again.

80
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,000
What about you?

81
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,230
I should...

82
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,230
Come out to the park. It's so nice to run these days.

83
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,760
I will. Goodbye.

84
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,690
Bye.

85
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,710
But he's not here today.

86
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,360
- Sorry?
- Your boyfriend.

87
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,790
Oh, he was out here that day because he was coming over.

88
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,330
I guess he has a more caring personality than he looks.

89
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,180
I was impressed by him holding a bunch of green onions.

90
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,330
And giving me his jacket, too.

91
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,090
There are times when he's caring and times when he's not.

92
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,700
Is that so?

93
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,990
Goodbye. I'll see you tomorrow.

94
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,000
It's weird. She lived here by herself from the beginning.

95
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,600
But why does it feel so unfamiliar?

96
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,050
Yumi, I broke the table leg while changing the light bulb.

97
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,820
I fixed it temporarily, but don't put anything heavy on it because it's dangerous.

98
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,080
I'll apply for A/S* and change it for you.
(= After Service. Includes warranty, repair, or checkups.)

99
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,070
I'm sorry. It is a favorite of yours.

100
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,230
Are you talking about the table for two people?

101
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,260
Yes, the 325TD model.

102
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,640
I only have to replace one leg.

103
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,320
That's a discontinued model. A/S would be impossible.

104
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,980
- Impossible?
- Yes.

105
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,250
It'll be impossible to change one leg but if you want the same one, I can check if we have it in stock.

106
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,020
I see ... How much would that be?

107
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,300
One moment. 325TD.

108
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,440
It is 1.55 million won.

109
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,430
1.55 million won?

110
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,170
Yes.

111
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,920
Emergency. Emergency.

112
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,630
- What now?
- What happened?

113
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,570
I'm sick and tired of emergencies. Jeez!

114
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,110
Wung can't afford the table with his bank account balance.

115
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,810
What? That's ridiculous. He doesn't even have 1.55 million won in his account.

116
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,990
No, his current balance is ...

117
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,690
Current bank account balance.

118
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,530
1.32 million won.

119
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,200
How can there be only 1.32 million won left?

120
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,630
A few days ago, there was about 10 million won.

121
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,020
Office expenses and loan interest were withdrawn on the 15th.

122
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,320
Then how about buying something cheaper with a similar design?

123
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,210
Since one leg is broken anyway.

124
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,180
He can't.

125
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,050
He can't again?!

126
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,740
Did you know this is the most expensive item in the house?

127
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,970
The dining table?

128
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,700
Yes, I went with my cousin when she was shopping for her newlywed home,

129
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,480
and at the moment I had an impulse to buy it.

130
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,660
I got it for getting promoted to assistant manager.

131
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,810
Is the brand good?

132
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,330
It's a brand that doesn't even match the house.

133
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,730
After hearing that, it suddenly looks really good.

134
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,240
If I ever move, I'm only taking this with me.

135
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,140
Take me too.

136
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,810
It can't be helped. I'll use the credit card.

137
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,480
You can't.

138
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,630
What! Can't again? Why can't the card be used now?

139
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,140
All Woong's credit cards are maxed out

140
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,720
Reason. Let's ask Yumi if she can wait until next month's payday.

141
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,750
Are you saying Yumi should use the broken table for a month?

142
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,370
It's really embarrassing and I feel bad

143
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,050
but Yumi will understand.

144
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,470
He has no other option.

145
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,040
There''s no money.

146
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,620
- What about Wung's pride?
- What?

147
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,080
Our first priority is Wung.

148
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,120
He didn't have to leave her place if his pride was going to be this wounded.

149
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,820
Hello? Why aren't you coming along?

150
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,260
Louis.

151
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,200
Sorry for asking, but do you have any money?

152
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Money?

153
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,150
I don't have any money. I didn't even pay back the loan I took from you yet.

154
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,060
Can you just pay me back partially? I kind of need it urgently right now.

155
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,530
I'll give it back next week.

156
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,100
Well...

157
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,950
Well.. about 20...

158
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,470
No about 30?

159
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,900
Transfer that much for now.

160
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,680
All right.

161
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,340
Send it right now.

162
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,780
Sorry.

163
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,470
I should be sorry, dude.

164
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,000
Thanks.

165
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,790
Yes, Gi Hyeong. What's up?

166
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,020
Oh, right.

167
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,750
It's hot. Slow down.

168
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,480
- It's so good!
- What?

169
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,180
It's sooo good! It's a marvelous combination, a perfect choice.

170
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,410
Who is it?

171
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,490
Yumi, it's me.

172
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,230
Wung? Did he just say Wung?

173
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,310
Huh? Wung must be here. Why is he here?

174
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,620
Alright! Wung's here!

175
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,930
What? Is he coming back?

176
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,930
Because he regretted leaving?

177
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,870
If he's here this late, it means he's sleeping over.

178
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,760
Wung!

179
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,170
May I come in?

180
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,220
Of course. What are you talking about? Come in.

181
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,510
I was going to call you but your light was on.

182
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,420
Yes, I got off early today.

183
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,510
I see...

184
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,470
Were you eating?

185
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,980
- Yeah. Have you eaten?
- Not yet.

186
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,010
- Great. Let's eat together.
- No, it's okay.

187
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,580
Come in. I just need to set another set of silverware. Close the door.

188
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,130
It's not that...

189
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,960
Come in, please.

190
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,170
I brought some people to take that table.

191
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,920
- I thought it'd be a hassle for you to throw that away.
- What?

192
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

193
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,910
It's this one.

194
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,670
- Not the chairs?
- No, please leave the chairs.

195
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,140
I thought you were using the warranty.

196
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,000
You can't use the warranty because it's discontinued. So I ordered a new one.

197
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,380
You ordered a new one?

198
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,800
That's pretty expensive.

199
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,460
I ordered the exact same one and it'll be here tomorrow.

200
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,960
Can you hold on till tomorrow?

201
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,680
Wung, there's no need. Why would you...

202
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,070
I can't not do something.

203
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,430
I'm really fine.

204
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,490
I'll get going. I have to see those guys off.

205
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,040
You're leaving right now?

206
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,070
I have to be at the office but I came here

207
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,010
because this was the only time that worked for them.

208
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,510
Eat before you leave.

209
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,800
I have to get going.

210
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,660
Oh, when the table is delivered, I was supposed to pay them cash.

211
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,130
So I'll transfer it to your account.

212
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,690
It's okay, right?

213
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,190
Don't send me money.

214
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,710
Wow, fried dumplings with bibim-ramyeon.

215
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,710
That's the best combination.

216
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,540
Yumi, I'll get going.

217
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,300
I'll call you.

218
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,980
Wung.

219
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,410
Yes?

220
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,890
Don't send me money, seriously.

221
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,780
I broke it. Of course, I should pay for it.

222
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,750
That's an antique.

223
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,620
The legs were squeaky.

224
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,670
It was time for a new one so I was going to get a new one anyway.

225
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,930
Then should I cancel it?

226
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,750
Do you want to get a different one?

227
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,740
I can cancel it now. You can get what you want—

228
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,270
That's not what I'm saying.

229
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,650
I'm saying don't send me money.

230
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,090
If you do, I'm going to be really mad.

231
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,230
Don't send me money.

232
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,310
Please sign here!

233
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,790
All right. I'm coming.

234
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,380
Bye.

235
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,020
Should we meet this weekend?

236
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,410
Good night.

237
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,050
Bye.

238
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,840
It was at that moment that something odd happened to Love.

239
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,080
What's going on?

240
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,950
What is this?

241
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,490
Ms. Yu * Kim
Gu Wung has transferred you 2,000,000 won (≈$1,700).
Your total balance is 3,583,021 won.

242
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,990
Episode 37: Bursting the gourd

243
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,080
Whenever it is cloudy or rainy as it has been nowadays,

244
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,240
never do laundry!

245
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,010
So I've been putting off washing my sheets for a few days now.

246
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,610
Thankfully, today

247
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,350
the weather is nice.

248
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,440
Damn.

249
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,620
You just cursed, didn't you?

250
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,740
You must have misheard me.

251
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,220
Hurry up and start the laundry. While the laundry is going, you can start cleaning the room.

252
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,340
Don't put it off again.

253
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,280
Damn.

254
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,850
Because Wung isn't around anymore, the household went back to normal.

255
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,480
How did it get messed up so quickly?

256
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,690
The fridge is empty.

257
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,910
I guess I have to go grocery shopping.

258
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:38,350
♫ It's slowly closing.♫

259
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,840
♫ A holiday where through the small leaves there is a small boat. ♫

260
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,440
Should I make fried tofu rice balls? Wung likes them.

261
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,630
♫ Spread your arms and follow the wind's path. ♫

262
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,050
If he's not going to eat it.

263
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,390
♫ A holiday where through the small leaves there is a small boat and me. ♫

264
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,660
Since I'll be the only one eating, there wasn't much to buy.

265
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,140
♫ Spread your arms and follow the wind's path.♫

266
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,500
The breeze feels cool. The weather is so nice today.

267
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,600
The weather really is so nice, Yumi.

268
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,310
I want to go hang out somewhere nice.

269
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,770
Of course! You have to go somewhere good when the weather is this nice.

270
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,430
How about Samcheong-dong? Yumi likes that place.

271
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,740
If we go to Samcheong-dong, the three-part combo of churros,

272
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,330
knife-cut noodle soup, and pastries are the best.

273
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:40,740
That's right. Next time, I'll have to go on an outdoor date for the first time in a while.

274
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,310
Wung, what are you doing? Have you had lunch yet?

275
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,300
Let's go get knife-cut noodles in Samchenog-dong on Saturday.

276
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,570
I have to go to a classmate's wedding on Saturday.

277
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,140
He said he was planning for the end of the year, then he suddenly contacted me.

278
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,230
A wedding?

279
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,800
Where?

280
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,960
In Jongro.

281
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,660
Then, should I go with you?

282
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,350
Let's go to Samcheong-dong after the wedding.

283
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,580
Are you going to Yeong Gu's wedding?

284
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,650
Yeong Gu's wedding?

285
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,350
Yes. It's this Saturday. Are you going?

286
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,090
I don't know. I was thinking about it. Why?

287
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,450
- Are you going to go with Yumi?
- I asked you first.

288
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,420
I won't go if Yumi is going. Yumi doesn't like me.

289
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,210
If that's the only reason—
No! I'm not going.

290
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,140
I was just planning on sending them congratulatory money anyway.

291
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,560
Yeong Gu was closer to you. We weren't that close.

292
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm not going.

293
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,440
Sure. Let's go together.

294
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,250
- Miss Yumi is doing well right?
- Yes.

295
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,270
Are you two getting married?

296
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,480
Why aren't you responding?
Are you messing with me? You know my situation.

297
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,470
You've become twisted, Gu Wung.

298
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,610
You're right. Nowadays I'm twisted.

299
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,930
That's why you should think about it carefully.

300
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,910
Call me when you make a decision.

301
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,570
I'm heading out.

302
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,640
Yumi!
Wung!

303
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,020
You got here early. Let's go, I'll introduce you to the groom.

304
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,640
But. By chance ... Did Sae Yi come too?

305
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,130
No.

306
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,170
I didn't think of that.

307
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,080
If meeting me would be uncomfortable for her.

308
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,620
I heard she's not coming. Don't worry.

309
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,250
Let's go.

310
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,910
Yes, right now?

311
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,820
All right.

312
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,520
- Yumi.
- Yes?

313
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,890
I think I have to go help the groom.

314
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,770
- Right now?
- Yes.

315
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,320
Do you want to go get started eating first?

316
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,510
Alone?

317
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,080
Louis!

318
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,740
Yes?

319
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,000
Take care of Yumi.

320
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,380
All right.

321
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,260
- Come back quickly.
- It won't take too long.

322
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,380
Get started eating.

323
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,190
Let's go. You must be hungry.

324
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,870
Sure.

325
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,250
Oh? Your tastes are similar to mine.

326
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,770
What do you mean?

327
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,440
I'm making a mound on my plate.

328
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,380
Ah! Yes. I didn't eat breakfast this morning.

329
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,010
But my plate mound is a little taller than yours.

330
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,320
Miss Yumi, you should get started eating first. I want to go get some steak.

331
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,650
Sure.

332
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,190
But didn't Wung come today?

333
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,230
No, he did come. He must have gone to help Yeong Gu out.

334
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:03,240
Those must be Wung's friends. Let's eat prettily.

335
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,060
But did Sae Yi come today?

336
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,610
Sae Yi probably didn't come.

337
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,590
She doesn't really go to weddings.

338
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,220
Why not?

339
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,220
She has always been a little stuck-up.

340
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,380
Oh! Isn't that Sae Yi?

341
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,370
Where?

342
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,870
- It's not!
- No?

343
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,840
Hey wait. Are you secretly waiting for her to come?

344
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,030
It's not that.

345
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,030
Hey. Be honest.

346
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,230
Were you a Sae Yi fan while we were in school?

347
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,400
It's been a while since I heard anyone say Sae Yi fan.

348
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,480
There were a lot of Sae Yi fans among us when we were in school.

349
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,420
Wung was the real Sae Yi fan, not me!

350
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,370
Does he still like her?

351
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,720
Probably not. I heard he has a girlfriend.

352
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,440
What? What kind of person is his girlfriend?

353
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,450
Is she stuck-up too?

354
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,530
Why? Because Sae Yi is stuck-up?

355
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,760
Well, preferences don't change that much.

356
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,860
Ask him when he gets here.

357
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,840
How could I ask him?

358
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,160
Where did she go?

359
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,150
Miss Yumi?

360
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,370
Hey, Louis!

361
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,430
Hey!

362
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,720
- It's been a long time.
- It's been a really long time.

363
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,830
Your face has changed a lot.

364
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,610
You too.

365
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,700
Yumi!

366
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,470
I was wondering where you went. Why are you out here?

367
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,070
Did you eat already?

368
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,580
Yes. The buffet was really good.

369
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,440
You should eat too. You must be hungry.

370
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,240
It's okay. Let's just go to Samcheong-dong.

371
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,420
Why? I can wait. Take your time and eat. Louis is probably still inside.

372
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,880
No, no, let's just go to Samcheong-dong.

373
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,540
Let's go.

374
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,140
I think we can walk there.

375
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,580
It says it's only 500 meters.

376
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,170
All right.

377
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,880
- By the way, Wung.
- Yes?

378
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,350
What do you like about me?

379
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
What?

380
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,300
Sometimes you ask really random questions.

381
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,690
Don't change the subject.

382
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,080
What do you like about me?

383
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,800
♫ On the days I come home alone ♫

384
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,060
♫ become the days you embrace my weary heart ♫

385
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,680
Eat dinner with me.

386
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,700
♫ The empty time filled with loneliness ♫

387
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,330
Are you rejecting a second date?

388
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,600
No, not at all.

389
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,700
It's just that it's so late, so I think most places are closed.

390
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,870
They'll still be open until 9 p.m.

391
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,080
Nine p.m.? What time is it now?

392
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,760
What time is it? It's ...

393
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,850
It's Seoul*.
(*T/N: Seoul the city sounds the same as Seoul time.)

394
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,540
On the day she started dating Wung,

395
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,630
Love put up a large gourd in the village.

396
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,050
- What is this? It's a gourd.
- A gourd?

397
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,550
Yes, every time you're upset with Wung you can throw a bean bag at it.

398
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,230
Really? Can we?

399
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,010
Of course, that's why I set it up.

400
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,300
I see.

401
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,640
However, there weren't any cells who threw bean bags at the gourd.

402
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,830
I'm going to buy it!

403
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,000
Hey, Fashion, you can't. Stop there!

404
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,790
Go to sleep, Yumi.

405
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,980
♫ I'm afraid I'll get hurt ♫

406
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:46,740
Give me food. I'm hungry!

407
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,470
Because Yumi was happy.

408
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,160
The first cell to throw the beanbag was Sensitivity.

409
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,920
You didn't make it yourself, right?

410
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,620
Oh, this? Someone gave it to me.

411
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,750
You're so annoying, Gu Wung! That's a lie, isn't it?

412
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,170
Sae Yi gave you the yuja syrup!

413
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,980
Sensitivity, what are you doing?

414
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,100
You guys throw it too. Love said to throw it if we get upset with Wung.

415
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,720
It feels refreshing.

416
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,740
Shall we?

417
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,000
Seems fun.

418
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,060
Are there any more?

419
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,800
We can just cancel the hotel and go home. Do as you wish.

420
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,260
- Now?
- If you want to go, we have to go now.

421
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,810
Even if we leave now, we'll get home at night.

422
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:50,410
You want to go home because you're sulking about that? Seriously, this guy sulks easily.

423
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,410
Why would we cancel the hotel, do you know how much it is? Are you a chaebol?

424
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,650
I even packed clothes because we were coming to Gangneung. Are you kidding?

425
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:03,480
After that, the cells threw bean bags whenever they got upset.

426
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,020
Guys, enough! Wung said he didn't cancel the hotel reservation!

427
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,010
Really?

428
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,920
I thought you were friends.

429
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,520
Yumi!

430
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,040
Or the day when Wung yelled at Yumi.

431
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Why are you yelling at Yumi!

432
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,380
Do you want to die, Gu Wung?

433
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,920
I hate you Gu Wung!

434
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,060
You're going too far!

435
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,510
You shouldn't do that!

436
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:39,170
I'll move out this week.

437
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,000
Why?

438
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,540
Even on the day when he suddenly said he would move out.

439
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,350
And on the day he sent money as he pleased.

440
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,720
Did I ask for your money? Are you the only one with pride?

441
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,530
I have pride too, you idiot!

442
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,400
Exactly, you're so annoying!

443
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,700
You jerk!

444
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,850
The gourd never once came close to cracking, let alone bursting.

445
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,980
The real Sae Yi fan wasn't me, it was Wung.

446
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,870
Does he still like her now?

447
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,700
Even when she found out Wung used to like Sae Yi,

448
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,360
You couldn't draw the line because you used to like her!

449
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,930
That's right, that was why! You jerk!

450
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,140
I'm so disappointed in you, Gu Wung.

451
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,750
A number of cells gathered to throw beanbags

452
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,250
but the gourd never cracked,

453
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,700
let alone burst.

454
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,320
I'm tired. Are you sure that thing can burst?

455
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,360
Our arms are just going to hurt more.

456
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,330
Do you think it'll crack that easily?

457
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,050
Hysterius.

458
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,270
How did you get down here?

459
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,060
I'm here because I'm annoyed. So annoyed.

460
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,720
Hey. That gourd was made by the prime cell, do you think it'll burst that easily?

461
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,100
Unless I step in.

462
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,120
Right!

463
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,690
Don't change the subject.

464
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,520
What do you like about me?

465
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,320
Why is that important?

466
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,630
We should go that way. Let's go.

467
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,550
So annoying! How is that not important?

468
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,820
Why? Why?!

469
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,570
What? It didn't even budge?

470
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,970
Explode! Explode!

471
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,380
Open already!

472
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,480
Damn it. What on earth is that made of?

473
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,770
Where should we go now?

474
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,000
- Yumi.
- Huh?

475
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,080
Where in Samchon-dong should we go? You said you wanted to go somewhere.

476
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,120
Let's eat churros. I want to eat churros.

477
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,350
- Churros?
- Yes.

478
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,090
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

479
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,620
- Here?
- Yes.

480
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,310
The tastiest in Samcheong-dong.

481
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,080
The churros here are the best in the country.

482
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,430
The line is this long?

483
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,020
I said it's the best in the country. I guarantee it.

484
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,710
Let's go.

485
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,850
How is it?

486
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:47,640
What should we eat? Original or chocolate is good.

487
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,320
The line isn't moving quickly.

488
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,200
It's because they make it on the spot.

489
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,740
But still, the line is too long.

490
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,600
This? It's really quick.

491
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,970
Maybe 15 minutes? 20 at most? It'll be our turn soon.

492
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,720
I never understood why people stood in lines to buy things.

493
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,870
Isn't it a waste of time?

494
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,740
Then should we eat something else?

495
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,580
I'm just saying. You said you wanted eat this.

496
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:23,010
We can eat something else. This place is full of good places.

497
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,480
Should we then?

498
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,070
The line is just so long. Let's go.

499
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,920
My churros!

500
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,670
My churros! I came here to eat this!

501
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,750
Gu Wung, you jerk!

502
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,850
What's so hard about waiting that long?

503
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:05,140
Oh no! It might burst!

504
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,500
What? It still didn't open?

505
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,220
How can this be?

506
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,700
That doesn't open.

507
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,830
It's strong.

508
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:26,290
Because her love is so deep, it'll never break.

509
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,280
Wung, it was nice going on a date, since it's been a while.

510
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,880
I'm a little sad we didn't get to eat the churros, but next time let's go to that bakery I mentioned.

511
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,340
You must've been tired today. Get some rest and sleep well.

512
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,020
Yes, you too.

513
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,150
Gosh this reply is really...

514
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,600
long.

515
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,690
Can he not use K?(Okay)

516
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,340
Just out of courtesy, since we sent this long, thoughtful text.

517
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,540
Seriously, I'm not happy with Wung these days.

518
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,390
What? What's going on?

519
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,320
It's not because I threw it, right?

520
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,690
It just slightly hit it.

521
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,190
This text really isn't anything.

522
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,230
Yes, you too.

523
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,320
But why am I so mad?

524
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:24,760
Break up.

525
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,930
Episode 38: Breakup Card

526
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,780
What's going on again?

527
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,600
No!

528
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,740
What's wrong with me these days?

529
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,690
Break up.

530
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,260
Break up.

531
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,000
The gourd is open.

532
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,550
I think she's around here.

533
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,530
Where did she go?

534
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,680
Love!

535
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,650
You scared me!

536
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:31,040
Sensitivity, this is the breakup card.

537
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,770
What?

538
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,860
- Love!
- What are you doing?

539
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,290
I'm using the breakup card today.

540
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,860
Today?

541
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,760
The ball broke.

542
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,530
That's why I kept losing power.

543
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,360
It's time to break up.

544
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,660
Love, you're scaring me.

545
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,510
This isn't like you.

546
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,600
What's like me?

547
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,710
You saw the gourd open.

548
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,820
If we keep on dating,

549
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,510
Yumi might die of stress.

550
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,400
Love, don't be so rash.

551
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,560
Let's discuss it with friends.

552
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,450
He's right. Acting like this because of these reasons...

553
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:29,500
What more reasons do we need when the gourd burst? It's all over!

554
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,890
But Love, you're love.

555
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:36,980
Isn't it your job to protect love until the end more than anyone else?

556
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,980
That's right. Until the gourd breaks,

557
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,260
to love with all my might is my job.

558
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,300
However,

559
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:57,370
it's also my job to turn away when the gourd breaks.

560
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,200
Yes, Yumi.

561
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,880
Wung, where are you?

562
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,640
Me? At the office.

563
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,970
Are you busy?

564
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,170
No, I just got here. Why?

565
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,660
I'll come to your office right now.

566
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,160
Can you come out for a sec?

567
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,800
Now?

568
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,660
Can I be there by 11?

569
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,660
Sure. But is there something wrong?

570
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,360
I'll call you when I'm there.

571
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,370
The weather's too nice for a breakup.

572
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:59,520
Breakup
We're breaking up.

573
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,900
Don't you think so? Out of all the days, on such a beautiful day...

574
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,070
Weather doesn't matter. No need for a lecture.

575
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,660
We'll throw the breakup card then turn right away.

576
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,300
Yumi.

577
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,320
He's here.

578
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,960
Here goes the breakup card!

579
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,340
I can't watch.

580
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,670
I thought you're resting at home today. What's up?

581
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,340
Anyway, it's nice. It's good to see you out of the blue.

582
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,590
You haven't eaten lunch yet, right?

583
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,760
Lunch?

584
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,060
It's almost noon. Let's go get something good.

585
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,980
No, I—

586
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,140
There is a new place that makes home-cooked meals, it's really good.

587
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,200
You like ripe kimchi.

588
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,820
I wanted to eat with you there when you stopped by.

589
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,580
Hmm?

590
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,500
Let's go.

591
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,820
What happened? Did she throw it?

592
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,950
You look for yourself.

593
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,590
Why? I thought you were going to end it.

594
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:53,190
Let's feed him before we end it.

595
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,280
It's the last time. I feel bad.

596
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,620
We'll eat, throw the breakup card, then take off.

597
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,960
Isn't it good?

598
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,700
Yes.

599
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,260
How come you're not eating?

600
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,420
I ate a lot.

601
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,740
Their nurungju tea is free. It's really good.

602
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,540
Just a sec.

603
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,110
We're done eating.

604
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,480
Now I'm throwing the card.

605
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,810
Yumi, try this. It's really good.

606
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,900
- Wung.
- Yes?

607
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,570
What?

608
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:02,270
But since earlier you don't look well. Is something the matter?

609
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,360
Are you sick?

610
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,040
I don't think you have a fever.

611
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,810
What's up with you?

612
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,320
Why are you so different today from yesterday?

613
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,100
Yumi, are you sick?

614
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,660
No.

615
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,380
No?

616
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,400
Let's go if you're done.

617
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,950
Aren't you throwing it?

618
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,920
I can't do it while looking at him in the eye.

619
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,370
Let's say it while we're walking.

620
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,690
Keep looking straight ahead.

621
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,790
I think that would be good.

622
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,690
It's so hot.

623
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:34,920
Time really flies.

624
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,000
Yumi, are you hot?

625
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,090
Should we get some iced coffee?

626
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,430
Wung.

627
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,590
Yes?

628
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:53,070
I have something to say.

629
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,080
Are you really throwing it? Right now?

630
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:03,050
♫ I like a quiet night ♫

631
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,530
What? Not this time again?

632
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,530
Love, what's going on?

633
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,420
Didn't you already make up your mind?

634
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,780
You said you can't go back as long as the gourd burst.

635
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,960
♫ wherever your toes touch ♫

636
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:31,360
♫ With a dream, waves and the sand ♫

637
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:36,080
I'm Gu Wung.

638
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:41,430
The ones I find cute are people who look like you.

639
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:48,650
♫ A minor romance, my own festival ♫

640
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,940
What are you doing? What's wrong?

641
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,950
To be honest ... I was curious,

642
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,020
since you didn't reply.

643
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:06,000
My phone was broken, so it is at the repair shop.

644
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,750
Ah, so that's what happened!

645
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:15,070
I thought...

646
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,290
I got rejected.

647
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,760
♫ That's fine with me ♫

648
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:38,970

♫ when the song coming out of the radio ♫

650
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,890
♫ takes me back to the the time ♫

651
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:59,750
♫ which shined most beautifully ♫

652

♫ I want to turn around, ♫

653
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,580
What are you doing? Stop thinking of the past.

654
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,890
Just throw it. Throw it!

655
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:14,330
♫ Lie on the bed ♫

656
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:19,240
♫ and pull the cover up to your face ♫

657

♫ even if I pretend I'm not, I'm hiding. ♫

662
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,910
I can't do it.

663
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,630
Love!

664
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,830
♫ Oh love ♫

665
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:00,860
Guys, I think I need some time to think.

666

♫ Will this love which fills a small fist, ♫

667

♫ If I can make you happy, ♫

668
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,800
I think we

669
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,860
need to take some time away from each other.

670

♫ Will I ♫

671
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,310
♫ have another chance? ♫

672
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:42,320
Break up

673
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:53,520
One hour earlier

674
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,370
Hey, your phone is ringing.

675
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,070
- What?
- Isn't that your phone?

676
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,830
Yes, Yumi.

677
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,900
Wung, where are you?

678
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,660
Me? The office.

679
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,240
I'll go to your office now.

680
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,610
Can you come out for a bit?

681
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,410
Right now?

682
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,960
Is it okay if I get there around 11?

683
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,410
Okay.

684
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,670
But ... is there something wrong?

685
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,870
I'll call you when I get there.

686
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,390
All right, got it.

687
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,570
Danger Detected. Danger Detected.

688
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:45,650
What is it today?

689
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,100
Based on Yumi's voice data analysis,

690
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,880
there's a 95% she's going to use the breaking up card.

691
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,070
What?

692
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,750
A low voice and concise tone.

693
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,070
It is different from Yumi's voice data accumulated so far.

694
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,150
Why? What did Wung do wrong?

695
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,470
How did the last conversation with Yumi go? Pull up the data!

696
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,940
Okay!

697
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,870
Wung, it was nice going on a date, since it's been a while.

698
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,320
I'm a little sad we didn't get to eat the churros

699
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,460
but next time, let's go to that bakery I mentioned.

700
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,930
You must've been tired today. Get some rest and sleep well.

701
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:31,270
See? The last message Yumi sent was so sweet.

702
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,330
Exactly.

703
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,010
That can't be the case.

704
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:44,640
Don't you think it's because the reply to that message was insincere?

705
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,420
- Yes, you too.
- Oh come on.

706
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,860
Wung has always been short with his words. It can't be because of that.

707
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,140
Does it make sense to suddenly break up?

708
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,920
It's a wrong analysis.

709
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,610
There wasn't anything wrong with Yumi's voice.

710
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,760
The data doesn't lie.

711
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,920
There's a 95% chance

712
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,930
that Yumi will throw the break up card.

713
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:18,060
I can't trust that data analysis.

714
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:26,910
But what if she really is coming to break up?

715
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,710
I think I'll be mad.

716
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,090
What did you say?

717
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,930
I'll be back.

718
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,270
Where are you going?

719
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:45,610
Yumi's coming. We might get lunch.

720
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,570
All right.

721
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,240
Why does he look so serious when he's going to meet his girlfriend?

722
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,730
How can this be one sided?

723
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,010
If she was upset about something,

724
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:20,200
why didn't she give us any signs?

725
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:38,210
I get it, we're not exactly the type to talk about our feelings either.

726
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:42,630
We can't be like that to Yumi.

727
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,600
But still, this isn't it!

728
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,000
Breaking up just because our reply was insincere–

729
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,910
Alert. This week's priority list has been updated.

730
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:55,420
Is that important right now?

731
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,120
Put it on the screen.

732
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,610
Either way, Wung's priorities never change.

733
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,800
- This week's priority list has changed.
- What?

734
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,740
11 SWL Studio. 10 Meat dumplings.

735
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,410
9 Louis. 8 Wugi

736
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:14,450
No way. Has Yumi been pushed out of the top 10?

737
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,950
No, Yumi is number one.

738
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:25,250
♫ I am afraid of hurting you so I'll squeeze through the gap​ ♫.

739
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:30,510
♫ Cutting through my disappointment ♫.

740
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:35,950
♫ Actually I don't know any more​ ♫.

741
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:40,210
♫ I hope you'll smile for me ♫.

742
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,940
Yumi!

743
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,950
♫ If you meet my eyes first ♫.

744
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,860
I thought you were resting at home. What's up?

745
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,360
♫ Is today also a day ♫.

746
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,460
The moment you feel a break up,

747
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:55,750
you realize the things you've forgotten.

748
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:59,830
Anyway, it's nice. It's good to see you out of the blue.

749
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,520
Isn't it good?

750
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,000
Yes.

751
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,590
How come you're not eating?

752
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:13,210
I ate a lot.

753
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,410
Their nurungju tea is free. It's really good.

754
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:17,900
Just a sec.

755
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:23,930
♫ I want to smile for you ♫

756
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:29,800
♫ I want our eyes to meet again ♫

757
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,810
♫ Today again, after a long time ♫

758
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:37,050
♫ I was looking forward to your heart ♫

759
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:41,930
♫ It finally returned. ♫

760
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:46,500
♫ I want to hang onto you​ ♫

761
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,910
It's so hot.

762
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,780
Time really flies.

763
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,010
- Wung.
- Yes?

764
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:56,650
♫ On top of my pillow ♫

765
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,720
♫ our beautiful times ♫

766
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,950
I ...

767
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,050
have to tell you something.

768
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:08,050
♫ keep falling ♫

769
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,320
I think we ...

770
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,240
need to take some time from each other.

771
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,640
Who is my most precious number one priority?

772
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,340
Hello, excuse me.

773
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:51,380
By any chance, are you Mr. Gu Wung?

774
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:38,200
♫ When I'm wandering on the street after a tiring day ♫

775
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:44,740
♫ When I look up at the sky full of stars ♫

776
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:49,330
♫ Even if I don't extend my hand ♫

777
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:54,200

♫ comes and comforts me ♫

779
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,540
Yumi's Cells

780
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:08,880
It's not easy for someone who was always with their partner to suddenly be alone.

781
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,330
It becomes obvious quickly.

782
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,960
How did you hold back when you wanted to call?

783
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,360
What do you think Wung is doing right now?

784
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,360
I'm curious about him.

785
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,890
I miss you.

786
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:23,130
I said let's think things over

787
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,920
but I didn't want to be alone again.

788
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,460
Was I afraid Wung was going to leave me?

789
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,790
Tell me exactly. What exactly did you say?

790
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,060
♫ Always by my side ♫
