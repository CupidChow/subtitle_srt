Episode 39: Time Machine

4
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,010
Yumi has a cell that ignores principles.

5
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,290
Hey! Why are you only replying now? Did you break your fingers?

6
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,350
Do you want to get in trouble, Gu Wung?

7
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,590
Goodness! Are you all lright?

8
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,780
Guys, you have to throw harder!

9
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,350
- Throw it!
- So annoying!

10
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,490
Even though she threw the most bean bags to the gourd,

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,620
Wung.

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,170
Yes?

13
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,660
I have to tell you something.

14
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,620
I think we...

15
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,260
need to take some time from each other.

16
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,570
Oh no. Look at his face.

17
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,730
Seeing his face like that hurts my heart.

18
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,510
But it can't be reversed.

19
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,550
He would be so sad to get dumped on a beautiful day like this.

20
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,820
That's why he should've been good to her. You deserve this, Gu Wung.

21
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,210
You're so mean!

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,160
How can you be so cruel?

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,590
R-Rampage! Rampage, are you all right?

24
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,350
Is he dead?

25
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,270
I've made up my mind.

26
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,120
If he says he'll be good from now on,

27
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,490
no, if he does something even close to it,

28
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,000
I will make all this invalid.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,450
CPR, I need CPR.

30
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,460
Sensitivity, you're the one who always threw the bags at the gourd to make it burst.

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,940
I didn't.

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,200
I saw it a million times.

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,610
I'm sure you saw wrong.

34
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,110
Seriously! You were the one who had the most complaints about Wung!

35
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,610
Sensitivity is always like that.

36
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,800
She changes her decision depending on her mood all the time.

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,590
I won't die, right?

38
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,260
All right.

39
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,130
All right, I got it.

40
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,000
But whether it's unfortunate or fortunate,

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,740
Wung calmly just said "I got it".

42
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,830
Let me tell you how out of control Sensitivity is.

43
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,820
It was so exciting then.

44
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,110
Sensitivity, I know how you feel but this is not okay.

45
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,570
What's not okay?

46
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,800
Don't you think you should be more careful on a day like today?

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,700
No one can sleep because the screen is too bright.

48
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,990
Let us sleep.

49
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,480
Aren't you being too much?

50
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,230
It's too bright.

51
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,660
Whatever. I can't sleep.

52
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,850
I'm going to sleep after watching this.

53
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,680
Seriously!

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,610
You should think of Yumi, too.

55
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,200
How upset would she be when you play a trick like this today?

56
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,920
Please, let's go to bed early today.

57
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,030
- Sensitivity.
- What!

58
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,290
- Are you really going to keep being like this?
- Can't I even sing?

59
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,420
Of course not. Do you know what time it is?

60
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,350
Don't I have the freedom to express myself? I want to express my feelings right now!

61
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,530
Give me the microphone!

62
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,150
Stop it already! I don't want to hear it! You're a horrible singer! Seriously!

63
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,890
I didn't get to sleep at all.

64
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,400
One good thing is that Sensitivity is nocturnal so she doesn't work in the morning.

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,390
I did the right thing

66
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,760
yesterday, right?

67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,660
Of course. Yumi, let's get ready to go to work now.

68
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,430
It's nice out today, so it'll be good to wear blue and white.

69
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,230
You should lather up, start from the cheeks, rub on the T-zone and wash off completely.
[Facewash Routine!]

70
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,730
I got it.

71
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,670
Should we eat cereal or toast for breakfast?

72
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,010
Should we just eat both?

73
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,510
I didn't do laundry yesterday and there's no clean underwear.

74
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,710
What? Seriously, that little...

75
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,010
Come on, we have things to do.

76
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,570
- Good morning.
- Oh, you're early today.

77
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,460
Yes. Did you have a good weekend?

78
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,670
Yes. I went to Gyeongju over the weekend.

79
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,520
Really? That must've been nice.

80
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,140
It was so nice.

81
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,430
Do you want to see some pictures?

82
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,650
- Sure.
- Hold on.

♫ To me who am spending an unexpected day ♫

84
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,230

♫ So I can feel your love love love love ♫

86
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,850
I think it'd be good to get rid of it before Sensitivity wakes up.

Assistant Manager Yumi, please check this.

91
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,470
Sure. When do you need it by?

92
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,130
Uhh... Probably by 2 o' clock.

93
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,660
All right.

94
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,280
It's nice that there's no time to think about other things when she's focusing on work.

95
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,230
Guys, don't think about chatting, just push the millstone.

96
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,520
That's the way for Yumi.

97
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,540
But what if Wung comes by when she's off work?

98
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,900
Wait! Anxiety, you just said that word!

99
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,360
- Oh no!
- Oh no!
[Arrested]

100
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,710
For the time being, if you say the word "Wung," you'll go to jail.

101
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,340
Guys, I heard it!

102
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,270
She definitely said "Wung".

103
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,990
Arrested

104
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,990
Look at those guys.

105
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,340
They said "Wung" so recklessly.

106
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,350
Arrested

107
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,890
I hope there are no other cells going to jail like me.

108
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,290
- We'll get going then.
- See you tomorrow.

109
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,820
- Goodbye.
- See you tomorrow.

110
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,130
After work is the problem.

111
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,090
What should I do from now on after work?

112
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,900
It's Monday so it's a little weird to call someone to hang out.
[List of Yumi's female acquaintances]

113
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,120
Let's see... People she can call to hang out even on weekday evenings...

114
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
Here is one.

115
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,910
Go Si Hyeon

116
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,520
Go Si Hyeon. She lives nearby and she's free, so there's no burden.

117
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,640
Why did you call me? Did you miss me?

118
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,200
You must have broken up with your boyfriend!

119
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,020
Forget it.

120
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,710
She'll just make me upset.

121
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,190
It's been a while, should I go for a run in the park?

122
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,760
Yes, let's do that! If she runs, she'll get tired and will be able to sleep.

123
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,050
Then Sensitivity won't have time to whine.

124
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,170
It's probably still too chilly at night to run.

125
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,940
Hey, I can feel someone staring at us from the side.

126
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,760
- Who?
- It's Wung!

127
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,070
Awesome! If it's really Wung, then I approve!

Let's see. Hurry and look over!

130
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,090
It's not chilly at night these days.

131
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,620
It's perfect for exercise.

132
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
I'm off, too.

Assistant Manager Yu.

134
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,780
It's not easy for someone who was always with a lover

135
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,140
to suddenly hang out by themselves.

136
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,590
You need a lot of research to hang out by yourself.

137
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,470
How do you know?

138
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,730
There is something like that. An empty space...

139
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,080
shows soon enough.

140
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,700
Isn't it fascinating?

141
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,810
The bus is here. Let's go.

142
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,640
What should I do now?

143
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,240
There is nothing to do.

144
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,500
Yes, Wung.

145
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,470
You're home?

146
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,790
I either talked with Wung

147
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,070
or met with him at this time. It was one of the two.

148
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,790
What did she do before she dated him? Why can't I remember?

149
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,680
Wouldn't it be better if we take the time machine and travel to before she met him?

150
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,220
That's a good idea.

151
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,310
Let's go back to when she wasn't dating and see what she did.

00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,910
After a quick run, I took a shower and finished the book I was reading on my way back.

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,170
This is after midnight and I'm so lonely right now.

200
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,160
Without a doubt.

201
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,080
What? That stings.

202
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,760
Imagining myself spending exciting days with someone I love

203
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,840
makes me feel better.

204
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,080
I'm sorry I let you down.

205
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,850
I guess I won't be going through my old diary

206

Wow, that just hit the nail on the head.

208
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,330
This won't do. It's making me more depressed.

This is all because of Love.

You can't even run this far, Kim Yumi?

Oh, yes.

Isn't the night air nice? It's perfect for exercise.

220

You're right.

221
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,260
You can't get back to your original pace in one shot.

222
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,970
I once took a long break before starting to run again.

223
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,100
I gradually increased my pace as if starting all over, and it eventually worked.

224

I'm sure you'd be able to get to your original pace if you bring it up little by little.

Sure.

228
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,730
I ran.

229

If you still wanted to call?

230
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,750

We were tired from the long journey.

The fuel ran out, and we were exhausted trying to sort out all kinds of incidents.

- What did you say?
- Let go!

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,040
Try the ribs, Yumi. The ribs.

325
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,370
I'm full.

326
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,070
I'm stuffed.

327
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,140
Let's eat some watermelon, Yumi.

328
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,890
Watermelon.

329
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,910
Mom, I'm really full.

330
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,860
This is so sweet. Eat.

331
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,690
I have no room for this.

332
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,490
Hey, no! Her stomach is totally full. We can't take anymore!

333
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,170
What? I want to eat more.

334
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,080
The stomach will explode!

335
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,110
Yumi, don't worry and eat.

336
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,950
The stomach will explode.

337
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,640
I already talked with the stomach cell.

338
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,350
What?

339
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,350
This is so sweet!

340
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:37,300
Hey, Reason. I knew this would happen, so I made partitions in the stomach already.

341
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,410
Meal and dessert.

342
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,290
There's a separate space for the dessert, so don't worry, man.

343
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,810
Meal (C:) - Out of 50yb, 2yb available. Dessert (D:) - Out of 50 yb, 48yb available.

344
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,390
Last course, vitamins.

345
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,020
It's gummy.

346
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,150
You have a hard time swallowing pills, so I got these.

347
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,300
I'm the best, right?

348
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,570
I knew you're the best.

349
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:11,700
♫ Holiday where I wore out my soles from being on a stomping path ♫

350
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,080
My Yumi's favorite.

351
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,570
Dad, I'm full. I really can't eat anymore.

352
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,950
It's the twisted doughnut that you like.

353
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,830
Twisted doughnut?

354
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,450
Twisted doughnut from the market in town.

355
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,370
She ate it so much when she was little.

356
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,600
Wow, it's twisted doughnut!

357
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,160
Can you work something out for Dad's sake?

358
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,730
The stomach might really burst.

359
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,740
Oh, Reason, don't worry. Don't worry, man.

360
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,430
I divided the dessert part in two just in case, too.

361
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,660
Fruit and bread, baby.

362
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,330
You're really thorough.

363
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,580
Honey, she just got finished eating. For whom ... Oh, my.

364
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,960
There is a separate stomach for bread, Honey.

365
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:11,350
There you go. A separate stomach for the meal and bread.

366
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,240
She's my daughter.

367
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,860
Dad, I have another stomach.

368
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,420
I know. I have one, too.

369
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,550
Alcohol stomach.

370
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,410
You all understand, right? You know?

371
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,530
When you go home, dividing the stomach into partitions

372
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,600
is the basic of the basic.

373
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Eat, eat. Eat a lot. Gobble gobble, okay?

374
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,180
- Is it good?
- Yes.

375
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,280
You eat so well.

376
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,940
It's yummy, right?

377
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,590
It's so, so good!

378
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,490
It's really good 'cause it's warm.

379
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,550
Try it.

380
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,320
Will she be okay?

381
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,230
Don't worry too much, Reason. We can overdo it here.

382
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,930
We got into a fight while playing word chain.

383
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,380
This is Yumi's starting point,

384
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:15,730
Yumi's real home that resets her tired heart.

385
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,270
It's done.

386
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,370
Fail.

387
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,280
Just as expected.

388
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,030
On vacation

389
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:33,510
Ansan Station

390
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,450
Can you carry it all?

391
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,710
I'll be fine. I'll get going.

392
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,190
Wait.

393
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,370
Hold on.

394
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,030
You almost forgot this.

395
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,310
Right, my twisted doughnut.

396
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,410
Eat it on the way. It won't be good cold.

397
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,790
All right.

398
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,000
- Call when you get home.
- Yes, Dad.

399
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,830
Yumi, next time, come with him.

400
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,470
- Him?
- Wung or Gung, you said you had someone.

401
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,000
Bring him. Mom's curious.

402
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,570
I'll get going.

403
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,180
- Bye.
- Bye.

404
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,670
I'll come back.

405
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,550
Bye.

406
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,070
Being alone after having so much fun

407
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,960
makes you feel even more lonely.

408
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,310
I'm so lonely.

409
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,070
Maybe we should've stayed at home longer.

410
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,840
Can you bring me the microphone?

411
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,530
No.

412
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,760
I wonder what Wung's doing now.

413
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,360
Do you want to get arrested again?

414
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,270
Let them arrest me.

415
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,860
I wonder what Wung's doing.

416
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,140
Can we call Wung?

417
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,100
Stop it.

418
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,800
Can't we call Wung?

419
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,640
Why? What's the point of calling?

420
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,970
Because I miss him.

421
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,230
I miss him.

422
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,220
Yumi

423
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,090
Wung

424
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,290
Hello?

425
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,920
Yes, Louis. What's up?

426
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,690
So?

427
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,000
What did they say?

428
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,560
Wung

429
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,730
I told him we should take some time to think

430
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,410
but I don't want to be alone again.

431
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,620
Am I afraid that Wung might leave me?

432
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,520
Or am I just afraid to be alone again?

433
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,390
That night,

434
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,590
I dreamed the weird dream

435
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,620
that I had a few years ago.

436
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,100
Huh?

437
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:50,040
I've been here before.

438
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,240
Right, I was definitely here before.

439
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,750
It was a dream of me wandering around

440
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,470
a village where dwarf fairies seemed to live.

441
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
What is this?

442
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,400
Is it a millstone?

443
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,550
Oh, I remember this place, too.

444
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,890
There was a bulletin board around that corner.

445
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,310
There it is.

446
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,840
I was definitely here a few years ago.

447
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,270
On the day I felt the breakup with my ex,

448
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:11,280
I remember coming here and putting up a note with my wish.

449
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,340
With Wung

450
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,840
Are you going to stick that note?

451
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,690
Are you sticking that?

452
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,620
Who are you?

453
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,040
I'm the manager of that bulletin board.

454
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,790
If you put up a weird memo, I have to clean it up.

455
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,820
A weird one?

456
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,320
It's not weird. I just wrote my wish.

457
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,270
You want it to be a happy ending with Wung?

458
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,190
Yes. I still do.

459
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,610
I hope it's a happy ending with Wung.

460
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,170
I thought...

461
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,720
Wung was the male lead of my life.

462
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm sorry but Wung isn't the male lead.

463
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,770
What?

464
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,760
Then who's the male lead?

465
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,460
There is no separate male lead.

466
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,350
There is only one lead here.

467
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,920
Episode 41: Wung's Card

468
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,510
Hey.

469
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,850
Hey, tell me in detail.

470
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,230
What did they say exactly?

471
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,650
Everybody has their own cards.

472
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,400
♫ We know the hidden things inside ♫

473
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,700
I want to be alone.

474
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,020
Set me up on a blind date.

475
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,520
How about this one?

476
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,440
Leave me alone.

477
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,660
I'm so sick of this.

478
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,780
Ba Bi.
Burning Friday.

479
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,540
I'm sorry.
Hardship

480
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,060
I'll modify it then send it right to you.

481
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,300
You can't really see it since it's the card in your mind.

482
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,820
♫ I feel I am changing for us ♫

483
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:24,600
♫ Now even the small things are all significant ♫

484
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,270
Yumi, are you doing well?

485
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,940
Yes, I'm doing well. How about you?

486
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,120
I'm doing well.

487
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,180
Are you free tomorrow?

488
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,720
I'll go near your house.

489
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,300
Sure. What time?

490
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,050
How about 2?

491
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,700
Sounds good.

492
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,460
I'll meet you in front of Bonjour Fountain.

493
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,940
Fine.

494
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,060
See you tomorrow.

495
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,940
Yes, see you tomorrow.

496
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,820
This is the card I'll use tomorrow when I meet Wung.
[Breakup]

497
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,410
Assistant Manager Kim, please look over this revised version.

498
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,500
Sure.

499
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,140
What is that?

500
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,480
It's nothing.

501
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:58,050
I don't show people at work the cards related to my personal life.

502
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,750
Huh?

503
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,280
Your boyfriend's picture isn't there. Did you take it off?

504
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,580
What? Did you break up?

505
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,500
No.

506
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,060
There are people like Han Byeol who are nosey.

507
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,160
♫ Will we be somewhere in that scene? ♫

508
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,850
♫ You and I. ♫

509
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,700
♫ Nightfallin' ♫

510
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,340
♫ At the end of the sun setting ♫

511
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,350
Oppa Wu Gi!

512
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,680
There are people who show their card like Ruby.

513
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,240
Oppa, Oppa!

514
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,540
Sending signals that I like you.

515
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,970
And there are people like Wu Gi who never show their card.

516
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,340
♫ We are walking to the same beat ♫

517
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,750
Oppa.

518
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,900
I got some tickets to a concert. Come with me.

519
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,380
Why would I?

520
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,040
Come with me.

521
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,380
Ruby wants to go with you.

522
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,880
Assistant Manager Choi, I'll be in the office.

523
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,820
- I'll come with—
- No.

524
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,760
♫ You and I ♫

525
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,780
♫ are headed toward the same place ♫

526
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,900
Please? Let's go.

527
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:11,120
It's Ruby's birthday next week. Consider it my birthday present and come with me.

528
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,130
I really really want to see it.

529
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,420
Hold on.

530
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,730
Will you come with me?

531
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,780
- Ruby.
- Yes?

532
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,580
If I'm being honest, what I think of you.

533
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,890
Wu Gi shows his card sometimes.
[0% interest in a relationship]

534
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:42,260
I'm sorry but this is how I feel.

535
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,550
From the day Wu Gi took out his card,

536
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,320
Ruby exchanged the card she had on her forehead.

537
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,580
Tell others of the sadness that happened to Ruby.

538
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,820
Two iced lattes and...

539
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,300
How about you, Ruby?

540
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,880
Ruby, what are you getting?

541
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,390
Whatever.

542
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,940
What's whatever? Then I'll get three iced lattes.

543
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,750
Whatever.

544
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,190
I'll take three iced lattes.

545
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,900
Sure.

546
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,350
Ruby, is there something wrong?

547
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,410
Does it show?

548
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,260
I was trying really hard to look normal.

549
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:38,140
Ruby, it really shows a lot.

550
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,180
That's interesting.

551
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,960
You're so quick, Eonni.

552
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:50,810
Eonni, where do you think my other half is?

553
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,160
What?

554
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,120
Will he even show up?

555
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,660
Just a second.

556
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,780
- Wu Gi.
- Seonbae.

557
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,180
- Did you eat lunch?
- Yes.

558
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,940
By the way, did you say something to Ruby?

559
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,140
I told her how I feel.

560
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,520
I thought it would be rude to keep ignoring it.

561
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,480
I see.

562
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,020
Yes.

563
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,460
I'm off.

564
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,290
Wait... Then...

565
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,080
Ba Bi said he has someone that he's interested at work

566
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,730
and there is a letter U in her name.

567
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,280
Ruby

568
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,830
- Assistant Manager Yu.
- Yes?

569
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,340
Is your research going well?

570
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,820
Research? What research?

571
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,340
- Research of hanging out by yourself.
- Oh.

572
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,080
Of course. It's going well.

573
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,140
Really?

574
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,450
Why do you seem to be disappointed?

575
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,060
If I'm good at hanging out by myself, shouldn't I get complimented?

576
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:34,150
Then you're not planning on seeing anyone for a while?

577
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,700
No.

578
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,850
If there is someone, I want to hang out together.

579
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,250
Oh, really?

580
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,810
Yes.

581
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,680
Then by chance...

582
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,140
Do you want to go on a blind date?

583
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,890
- Blin—
- Of course, I won't meet someone by a blind date.

584
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,480
I guess you don't really like blind dates.

585
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,450
No, I don't really like this sort of thing.

586
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,050
I see.

587
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,700
Should we start the meeting?

588
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,560
Yes.

589
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,780
Assistant Manager Ba Bi isn't the type to show his cards either.

590
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,260
This is today's agenda.

591
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:20,020
We will modify it a little more, but you can look at this for now.

592
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,290
I wonder who that is on that card.

593
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,580
It's probably Ruby.

594
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:48,560
But guessing other people's cards doesn't mean much.

595
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,240
I have my breakup card out but

596
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,260
I'm hiding another one.

597
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,700
Breakup

598
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,080
A random card that I can change my decision depending on the situation.
[Random - Leave the decision on the moment]

599
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:11,450
I will bring this card along when I meet Wung tomorrow.

600
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,510
It's Wung!

601
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,900
It's Wung!

602
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,070
Wung!

603
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,760
Wow, Wung has a ponytail!

604
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,400
Did he not wash his hair?

605
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,870
Wung.

606
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,480
You're here.

607
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,850
You tied your hair up.

608
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,290
It's too hot.

609
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,110
It suddenly got so hot.

610
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,920
You're right. It looks cool.

611
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,230
Really?

612
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,160
Should we get coffee from there?

613
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,810
Sure.

614
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,690
Let's go.

615
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:40,720
He kind of looks down.

616
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,630
Would you like some cake too?

617
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,120
No, I'm fine.

618
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,840
It's really hot, isn't it?

619
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,380
Right, it is.

620
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,760
How have you been?

621
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,330
Me?

622
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,880
I recently signed a huge outsourcing contract.

623
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,130
Really?

624
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,860
Congrats! Congrats!

625
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,590
An unexpected opportunity suddenly came.

626
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,500
I was surprised too.

627
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,470
I didn't even expect it.

628
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,820
That's great. Seriously, congratulations.

629
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,490
Thanks.

630
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,590
Aside from the money, I think it's a good opportunity.

631
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,050
I'm glad things worked out well.

632
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,970
You might become big.

633
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,120
I've just been revived.

634
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,140
I'm sure you'll get big.

635
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,270
I hope so.

636
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,430
What about you?

637
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,100
- Me?
- Have you adjusted in the marketing department?

638
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,740
Well...

639
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,240
Assistant Manager Han Byeol is so annoying

640
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,120
Wung, I'm annoyed by Assistant Manager Han Byeol.

641
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,950
I'm managing.

642
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,080
Seeing you say that, I guess you're doing pretty well.

643
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,400
Not well.

644
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:46,400
I get compliments from the manager from time to time.

645
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,440
Quite often lately.

646
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,480
That's a relief.

647
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,510
I was worried.

648
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,260
I'm still at the beginning of work.

649
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,270
At any rate, writing is fun.

650
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,420
You'll do great.

651
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,170
I hope so.

652
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,870
Yumi.

653
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:29,300
Oh my gosh! He called out her name!

654
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,350
Is he finally getting to the point?

655
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,290
Someone go get Love cell!.

656
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,660
Remember what we talked about last time?

657
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,280
Yes.

658
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,300
Wung took out his card.

659
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,110
Oh goodness. What card is it?

660
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,590
- I'm nervous. I'm so nervous.
- What do we do?

661
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,540
Hey, take out our card too!

662
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,060
You have the breakup card!

663
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,820
Yumi is innocent! Yumi, you can do it!

664
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,060
Love, did you bring the breakup card?

665
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,650
I did. It's right here.

666
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,640
Breakup

667
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,570
I don't think you should postpone it again this time.

668
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:30,430
- This time, we have to decide on a conclusion, Love
- Right.

669
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,890
Breakup

670
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,450
Don't worry.

671
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,810
To be honest, I brought along another card with me.

672
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,190
Breakup
Random

673
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,110
If Wung's card is to be friends, we will.

674
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:50,630
And if he doesn't want to break up, we won't.

675
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,530
That's my decision.

676
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,090
Back when ... we used to live together,

677
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,790
I remember it being my birthday.

678
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,750
You brought up marriage.

679
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,370
I did.

680
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,250
Back then...

681
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,910
For the first time back then

682
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,470
I thought that you and I might be different.

683
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,150
Even though that was obvious.

684
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,730
Yumi.

685
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,050
I thought about it a lot

686
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:57,620
and I think we should end it here.

687
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,260
Breakup - end the relationship

688
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,560
Breakup - break up
Random - leave the decision to the moment

689
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,210
This isn't it. This is not it.

690
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,990
Love, what are you doing?

691
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,930
- You have the breakup card.
- What?

692
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,640
Hurry up and throw the breakup card!

693
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,550
Hurry up! Throw the breakup card!
Throw it.

694
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,950
Why are you hesitating? You have to throw it.

695
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,820
That's right! Pathetic!
What!

696
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,510
Me?

697
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:45,400
Yes, Pathetic! Come help me quick!

698
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,070
Don't tell me you want to use the clinging card?

699
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,100
I do. Let's try clinging onto him.

700
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,010
Please, Pathetic! Just this once!

701
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,640
Wung.

702
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,740
What?

703
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,310
I...

704
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,140
Wung, I don't want to break up. Do we have to break up?

705
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,800
I said that because I was so angry then.

706
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,850
Let's think about it one more time.

707
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,780
You can't!

708
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,990
Who said you can cling on to him? Stop being pathetic!

709
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:33,880
Stop saying nonsense!

710
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,680
I, Pride cell, am still alive! What do you think you're doing?

711
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:42,860
What's with you, Love? Are you feeling weak again?

712
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,700
Do you not care what happens to Yumi's pride?

713
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,350
Pride, I...

714
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:52,930
You traitor! You don't deserve to be the prime cell!

715
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,280
Hand over the cards to me!

716
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,180
Didn't you hear me? Hand over the cards!

717
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,650
Breakup - break up
Random - leave the decision to the moment

718
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:25,040
If you can't do it, I will.

719

Breakup

723
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,900
I feel the same.

724
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,450
Then...

725
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,890
shall we leave?

726
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:23,160
Yes, let's go.

727
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,960
Breakup - end the relationship
Breakup - break up

I have to stop by somewhere.

You?

734
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,900
I'm going back to the office.

735
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,100
I'll get going first.

736

Okay.
