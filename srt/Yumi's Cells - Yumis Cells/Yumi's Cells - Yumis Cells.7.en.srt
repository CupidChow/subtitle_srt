Yumi

00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,990
Yumi's Cells

Episode 18
Priorities

4
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,100
Actually, lately I also feel that way every day.

5
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,410
I wasn't the only one who thought that.

6
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,160
Yumi! Yumi! Assistant Manager Kim!

7
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,300
You shouldn't sleep here. You should finish quickly and go home.

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,530
What time is it?

9
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,520
I was wondering why you weren't picking up. Were you sleeping?

10
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,900
I just bought anything since you weren't answering the phone. Pull yourself together.

11
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,200
Thank you.

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,650
You must have slept really well.

13
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,300
Yes, totally. I even had a dream.

14
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,020
Oh, it's Gu Wung!

15
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,710
Why are you standing in the rain?

16
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,860
You'll catch a cold like that.

17
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,600
What time is it?

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,610
It's Seoul*.
(*Seoul city sounds the same as Seoul time.)

19
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,620
It's the day of the rerun.

20
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,270
I actually bought Gu Wung's coffee today.

21
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,020
Let's drin-Gu Wung*! (pun with Gu Wung's name and the verb "to drink" in Korean.)

22
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,210
What the heck? I just had a dream of Gu Wung.

23
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,050
- A dream of Gu Wung?
- Yes.

24
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,450
I was on a blind date with Gu Wung.

25
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,680
Are you Gu Wung?

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,010
While dating, I also went to his place.

27
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,300
Gu Wung was holding me in his arms and running in the rain.

28
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,160
We even filmed a kissing scene.

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,740
What? Even a kissing scene?

30
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,660
And...

31
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,760
And...

32
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,640
Anyway, it was nice.

33
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,070
It was all a dream.

34
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,660
Assistant Manager Kim, wake up!

35
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,260
- Sorry?
- Wake up!

36
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,380
Why?

37
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,080
Wake up!

38
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,570
Why does he keep telling me to stand up*?
(In Korean, the same verb is used for 'wake up' and 'stand up'.)

39
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,660
Wake up! Ah, really ... Wake up!

40
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,540
Why does he keep telling me to wake up?

41
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,980
Wake up!

42
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,170
Wake up!

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,330
It was a dream?
 Wake up!

44
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,490
Wake up!

45
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,790
Oh, it startled me.
 Wake up!

46
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,940
It startled me.

47
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,080
Wake up!

48
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,000
You, Dream!

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,620
Why did you have such a dream!

50
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,610
- You scared me, you crazy guy!
- Why are you acting like this?

51
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,280
What's wrong? That was a nice dream!

52
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,260
It's a dream I specially made for Yumi–

53
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,450
Don't throw it at my face!

54
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:38,370
What makes you think you did well?! Stay here, crazy guy.

55
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,170
You guys don't even know

56
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,320
that if your dreams are happier than reality,

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,240
you get depressed when you wake up, you idiots!

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,450
When you wake up, reality needs to be happier,

59
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,410
so that was a good dream!

60
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,600
That's a relief. It was a dream.

61
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,620
Gu Wung
Did you sleep well? I just woke up.

62
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,970
Calls

63
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,040
Gu Wung

64
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,370
Gu Wung, I just woke up too.

65
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,560
Can you stop by my house later before going to work?

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,520
The reason is a secret.

67
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,870
This is too...

68
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,490
It's not good. Can't you make it look better, Cook?

69
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,630
I just cook! I can't do nice-looking food.

70
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,240
But still, pretty lunchboxes are important!

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,730
I make it taste good, not look good.

72
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,590
This just looks like a lunchbox for school.

73
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,270
That's not it...

74
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,600
I think they did it like this.

75
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,480
Oh, that is...

76
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,440
So cute!

77
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,060
It's an octopus!

78
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,410
His eyes are expressed with cheese and black sesame seeds. Who made this?

79
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,120
- What? She did.
- Wow.

80
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,630
Who are you? You're so good with your hands!

81
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,590
- I just tried, since there were sausages.
- Uh?

82
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,800
I've never seen you before, what's your name?

83
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,860
My name is 'I've seen this somewhere'.

84
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,080
I've seen this somewhere.

85
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,550
Yumi really made this for you?

86
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,350
The heart kimbap, the octopus sausages... Yumi really made this all?

87
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,590
- Of course!
- Yumi is good with her hands.

88
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,000
Hey, let me try this! I mean... Please let me try this.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,270
Why are you making such a fuss? Is it your first time seeing a lunchbox?

90
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,550
What the heck? Why did you get arrogant all of a sudden?

91
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,230
All right, all right. I'll give you the chance to taste it.

92
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,850
Instead, you have to eat it with reverence.

93
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,220
I'll enjoy it with reverence.

94
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,330
Hold on. She gave it to me to eat, so I should be the one who eats first.

95
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,930
Go ahead.

96
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,170
What, isn't it good?

97
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,070
It's seriously so good.

98
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,280
Then, can I eat now?

99
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,080
Eat, eat. But don't eat too much, because I have to eat it.

100
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,540
Thank you for the meal!

101
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,640
It's good! It's good.

102
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,630
Of course, my Yumi made it!

103
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,830
Hey, try one! It's really good.

104
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,350
- I'm fine.
- I said it's good, try it!

105
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,740
I don't want to eat it.

106
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,120
Just try some!

107
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,330
I said I'm fine. I'm not eating!

108
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,170
- It's good.
- Right?

109
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,260
It's really good!

110
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,800
I envy you Gu Wung.

111
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,550
Be as envious as you want.

112
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,840
Don't eat the heart kimbap.

113
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,670
Yumi, it's good! You're the best.

114
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,790
I'll make it for you again, I'm grocery shopping now.

115
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,600
So, he likes yubuchobap*.
(fried tofu rice balls)

116
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,150
I should make pollock roe yubuchobap this time.

117
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,840
Yumi's priorities ranking
11th: beer, 12th: dogs, 13th: marathon, 14th: Good place to eat, 15th: Anti-aging, 16th: necklace

118
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,940
17th: Frog dress, 18th: puppy game, 19th: Wung's favorite fried pork cutlets, 20th: diet.
New: Lunchboxes

119
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,760
20th place changed to a lunchbox.

120
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,330
A word related to Wung got up in the ranking again, right?

121
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,240
Yes. From 16th to 20th place, all are words related to Wung.

122
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,570
Wow, the frog dress is ranked on the 17th place.

123
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,920
The first rank is still Wung.

124
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,280
Not so much time ago, Wung was ranked 2nd.
6th: Romance novels, 5th: spicy rice cakes, 4th: Dad, 3rd: Mom

125
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,720
It must have changed after the trip to Sokcho.
2nd: Yumi, 1st: Wung.

126
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,860
Besides, after the first place changed, Love got stronger.

127
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,030
Hey, guys!

128
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,770
You scared me!

129
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,550
Let's go see Wung!

130
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,040
Wung? We already saw him yesterday.

131
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm sure he will want to see us today too.

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,690
Even if you go see him, he would probably be working. You might only get to see him for just a moment.

133
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,400
I want to see him even if it's just for a short time.

134
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,280
Yumi!

135
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,770
Wung!

136
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,950
You were already here? I said I would bring it to you.

137
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,500
It's fine, you're busy.

138
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,520
Here, I enjoyed it.

139
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,350
Still, it is so nice to see you again like this.

140
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,620
- Should we watch a movie?
- When?

141
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,670
Today. I think I'll be finished sooner than I thought.

142
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,990
- Really?
- Yes.

143
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,030
I just need to wrap it up. I'll call you as soon as I'm done. Around 8 o'clock?

144
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,930
Yeah!

145
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,600
I'll be waiting at home, so hurry in and wrap it up.

146
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,670
I'll walk you home.

147
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,830
What for? It's not even far.

148
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,510
Then, to the bus stop.

149
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,560
The bus stop works for me.

150
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,600
Let's go. Give that to me.

151
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,190
Oh! Sae Yi.

152
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,710
Hello!

153
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,460
Hello Sae Yi! It's been a while.

154
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,690
Yes, it has. You've been well, right?

155
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,090
Of course. You've been really busy, right?

156
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,100
Yes ... I have been quite busy.

157
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,660
Oh right. The lunch you packed was very delicious.

158
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,090
Oh really? That's good to hear.

159
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:52,000
I prepared a lot just in case. I'll send more next time.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,260
But ... Wung doesn't really like yubuchobap. He's more of a kimbap guy.

161
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,060
- What?
- Louis ended up eating all of the yubuchobap.

162
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,720
I like yubuchobap too. What are you talking about?

163
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,280
Wung doesn't really like sweet things.

164
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,300
Ah, I see.

165
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,230
There she goes again, there she goes. What does she know?

166
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,180
Let's just ignore her and go.

167
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,320
Wait, you guys. Let's do this.

168
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,280
Yumi, you should come hang out at our studio often.

169
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,230
Can I? I feel like I would be a bother.

170
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,830
Oh of course not. You're always welcome.

171
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,190
- I will. Take care.
- Goodbye.

172
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,560
I'll drop her off and be back.

173
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,180
-Oh wait, Wung.
- What's up?

174
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,020
Call me later.

175
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,840
Come over to my house later.

176
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,890
What did you get?

177
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,500
I love you.

178
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,180
Be careful of Sae Yi.

179
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,700
Ah what is it? What did she whisper?!

180
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,720
- You scared me.
- Damn it. I really want to know what she said.

181
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,390
Oh! The bus is coming. Head back.

182
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,980
Yumi, what was that earlier?

183
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,900
When you whispered in my ear.

184
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,490
Whisper.

185
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,620
It was nothing. Call me!

186
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,470
Yes! Good job Love!

187
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,490
We got her good for the first time.

188
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,340
That felt good! She must be so curious right now.

189
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,620
Every time I see her she gets on my nerves. It bothers me that she has an ulterior motive for Wung.

190
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,060
Let's not let it bother us. She's doing this alone. Wung has no interest.

191
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,830
That's right! Wung has fallen deep for Yumi.

192
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,450
Of course, he has. But still..

193
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,190
- But what?
- But what?

194
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,770
We believed that three years ago too .. and then we got tricked.

195
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,520
That's right.

196
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,970
You remember right? We felt sure and stable .. and then had such a big shock.

197
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,030
You don't think ... Wung could do something like that?

198
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,710
That wouldn't happen! Wung would never do that!

199
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,240
No ...

200
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm sure it wouldn't happen, but how about we confirm it?

201
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,850
Wung's feelings ... How Wung thinks of Sae Yi..

202
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,000
How?

203
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,550
I have an idea!

204
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,390
Hello? Are you done?

205
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,660
Yes. Right now. Should we meet in front of the movie theater?

206
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,420
All right. I'll come out now.

207
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,170
- Okay!
- Yes!

208
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,800
Since you have planned a date for tonight,

209
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,430
Wung!

210
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,660
- Did you wait long?
- No.

211
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,930
the love wormhole will probably open up tonight, right?

212
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,790
What's this?

213
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,880
A two-way radio that can receive within a one meter radius.

214
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,850
A two-way radio?

215
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,280
Let's point this towards Wung ... Here, try talking.

216
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,880
Ah, ah. Hello? Can you hear me?

217
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,340
- Yes, I can hear you well. When the love wormhole opens up, I will go into Wung's heart!
- What?!

218
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,830
If we want to know Wung's true feelings, we need to go inside his heart and check for ourselves.

219
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,230
I'll go and see where his priorities are at.

220
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,460
Here.

221
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,050
Come here.

222
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,570
It's the wormhole.

223
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,870
I'll be back, guys. Make sure to hang onto the radio!

224
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,890
All right, Love! Be careful!

225
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,580
Don't strain yourself, and if it's dangerous just come back!

226
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,300
Yes!

227
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,440
Ah, I'm so tired. Why am I the only one working?

228
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,440
What money do you use in Australia? Pocket*
(Word for pocket literally translates to Australian money too)

229
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,530
Oh gosh..

230
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,810
- What muk* can you not eat? Silence.*
(Jelly. Also means Spit jelly.)
- Was that funny? Do I have to laugh?

231
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,170
- That's not funny at all.
- Get rid of him.

232
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,930
- This is Wung's village, huh.
- Love. Love, over.

233
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,910
Hey, Reason. I arrived safely.

234
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,210
That's a relief. To find out the secret, you have to find the innermost corner of Wung's heart.

235
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,000
- Over.
- I found it.

236
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,840
Already?! Over.

237
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,720
It's right in front of me.

238
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,170
[Innermost corner of the heart]

239
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,670
All right, good. Then sneak in without anyone noticing.

240
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,990
If you go in deeper, there will be a place where they store secrets. Over.

241
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,160
Naughty thoughts

242
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,310
Did you find the secret place?
Things you don't need to say

243
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,350
Joke storage

244
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,260
- I don't see it yet.
- You don't think ...

245
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,670
I don't see it. Do you think maybe Wung doesn't have secrets?

246
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,180
Wung already has a bit lacking in emotional expression, but there's no way he doesn't have secrets.

247
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,170
Oh wait! I found it!

248
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,170
Password

249
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,150
We want to find out his priorities.

250
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:30,130
Priorities frequently change, so we just need to find the most recent data. Over.

251
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,940
It couldn't be... 123456

252
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,380
Password

253
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,860
Found it!

254
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,300
You have to find Sae Yi first!

255
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,050
You have to find her rank!

256
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,420
I don't care about the top ten.

257
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,750
Ranks after 11th are out of his interest.

258
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,920
Check if Sae Yi is out of the top 10.

259
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,040
Over.

260
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,350
Did you enjoy it?

261
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:26,350
Gu Wung's priorities
Level one secret
Updated 3 hours ago.

262
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,430
Sae Yi is...

263
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,140
11: Sae Yi, 12: Studio SLW, 13: Space rabbit, 14: Dad jokes, 15: Cleaning, 16: Sleep, 17: Shorts, 18: Basketball

264
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,060
Sae Yi is ranked 11th!

265
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,940
Only 11th?

266
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,640
It's fine, if she's ranked 11th there's nothing to worry about.

267
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,060
I knew it! Sae Yi was acting up for nothing by herself.

268
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,920
Then, what's in 10th? Over.

269
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,100
10th: Meat dumplings

270
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,800
It's meat dumplings.

271
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,710
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

272
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,750
It's over.

273
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,950
She can't even compete with meat dumplings. I was worried for no reason.

274
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,010
Then, is Yumi 1st? Over.

275
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,090
No, Yumi is 2nd.

276
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,700
She's not first? Then what is?

277
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,250
1st is...
 2: Yumi, 3: Mom, 4: Gu Seong Yeon, 5: Gu Jennie, 6: Dog Time, 7: Dad, 8: Wu Gi.

278
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,750
1st is Wung himself.

279
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:19,000
Moreover, he has never given 1st place to anyone else.

280
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,520
What did you receive?

281
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,810
That's interesting,

282
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,520
He put himself as the number one priority all his life.

283
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,930
Yumi gives the first place if she likes someone.

284
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,870
Are we the weird ones?

285
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,960
But it is a big gain that we confirmed that Sae Yi is not that important.

286
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,150
That is what is important.

287
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,180
You're right. I don't think we have to worry anymore.

288
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,060
Job well done, Love. Come back, over.

289
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,060
I will go across when the next wormhole opens.

290
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,020
What is this place?

291
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:23,160
Without us knowing, Love went into the sea of Wung's village that day.

292
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,030
And

293
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,520
she later revealed that she saw "desire to get married" which was abandoned deep in a place

294
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,540
from where was difficult to take it out.

295
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,700
Desire to get married

296
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,840
#EPISODE19 #FirstEncounter_Sorry

297
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,580
#EPISODE19 #Ihaveaboyfriend

298
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,660
We're getting married.

299
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,610
Na Ri really went big this time.

300
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,190
It's so good!

301
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,000
- She overdid it because she couldn't come.
- We can eat it all.

302
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,580
Guess Na Ri is getting married too.

303
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,030
There is now only you and me left, Yumi.

304
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,050
That's right.

305
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,360
Here, let the two of us cheer.

306
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,620
Cheer? Why?

307
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,150
The people who don't have anyone should have a drink.

308
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,620
If we remove you and me, everyone else here has a significant other.

309
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,160
Si Yeon, I am seeing someone these days.

310
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,860
Your pride is still the same, Kim Yumi.

311
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,230
It's for real.

312
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,380
You have a boyfriend? This is my first time hearing this.

313
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,820
It's for real.

314
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,980
It has not been too long though.

315
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,170
Really?

316
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:51,330
Then, let's see a photo of your boyfriend.

317
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,860
- Photo?
- You must have a photo of him.

318
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,360
Wait, his picture ...

319
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,840
Does this make sense?

320
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,990
The album of a girl who's dating is all pictures of food.

321
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,760
Sensitivity, whoa whoa.

322
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,980
What have we been doing without taking a couple photo all this time?

323
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,480
What did we do?

324
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,760
We went on a trip! Let's show a picture taken in Sokcho.

325
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,710
Sokcho.

326
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,320
There's none.

327
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,530
Why are there none?

328
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:57,340
Why do you think? It is because they were mostly in the room.

329
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,650
What you guys saw in the movie isn't what happened.

330
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,480
It is real life.

331
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,550
What? You said you are dating but don't have a single couple photo?

332
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,920
The both of us don't like taking pictures.

333
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,560
Oi, Kim Yumi. Throw your pride away, let's just have a drink together.

334
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,820
That's right. I do have a photo.

335
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,840
Here.

336
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,100
It is this man.

337
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,040
What is this? You really have someone?

338

[First Encounter_Sorry]

339
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:50,150
Wait a minute. Here it says "Sorry for doing this the first time we meet."

340
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:56,580
That is because we took that photo when we first met. We weren't dating yet.

341
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,500
Hey!

342
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,300
What a lame excuse. You are a bit flustered now, huh?

343
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,460
Yumi, it is all right. You have me.

344
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,090
We have nothing to be embarrassed about. We are confident single women, right?

345
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:16,450
Si Yeon, you must not believe me because I haven't dated for a long time.

346
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,570
Recently, I even got a necklace as a gift.

347
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,010
Necklace?

348
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,860
Where?

349
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,890
Where is the necklace?

350
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,600
She left it at home because she thought it would get worn out.

351
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,760
No one told you to do that!

352
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,290
It is at home.

353
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,000
I have some at home, too.

354
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,740
Fine. Anyway, stay strong, Yumi.

355
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,730
What do you mean 'stay strong'? I really do have a boyfriend.

356
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,050
What? Yumi, you have a boyfriend?

357
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,460
- Really?
- Who is it?

358
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,350
She claims that she has one, but there's no proof.

359
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,320
She doesn't have a picture either.

360
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,700
It is for real.

361
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,180
- Then you should come to Na Ri's wedding with your boyfriend.
- Huh?

362
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,640
Yes, you could do that, then.

363
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,410
Yes, we want to see him too.

364
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,120
I am curious.

365
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,560
Sure, I will introduce him at Na Ri's wedding.

366
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,250
Fine.

367
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,750
- Let's eat.
- Eat.

368
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,500
That's nice, we can even meet her boyfriend.

369
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,080
The 15th? I can't go.

370
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,320
What?

371
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,550
Because there is not much time left until the beta test, I don't think I can go anywhere even on the weekend. Sorry.

372
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,610
That can't be. That can't.

373
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,950
There are people who say you don't exist.

374
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,840
- I don't exist?
- They are the incarnation of jealousy.

375
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,850
They can't see us as a couple.

376
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,420
You have to come and prove your existence.

377
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,170
It's not as if I'm an alien. Prove what?

00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,290
Wung, come here for a bit.

379
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,620
Yumi, sorry. I will call you back.

380
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,200
What?

381
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,670
- This doesn't work.
- Move out of the way.

382

If he doesn't come with me, Si Yeon will again...

383
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,410
Why did I not think to take any photos?

384
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,370
Why do you think? It is because Photo also died and is gone.

[Photo cell]

There's a lot of hobbies Yumi barely got into.
Writer cell. Math cell. Travel cell.

387
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,340
If he can't come to the wedding, should I have Si Yeon meet him separately?

388
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,750
But wait, what should I wear to the wedding?

389
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,250
The clothes I'm going to wear...

390
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,800
Do I need to buy something?

391
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,940
Yumi, is that you?

392
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,350
It is. I wasn't sure.

I can't believe I'm running into you here.

What is it? Why is the siren ringing?

395
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,860
What's happening? It's bad. Reaction #1, come out!

396
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,840
Owner, it's been a while since you had a mission for me.

397
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,330
It's an emergency. Please act as calmly as possible.

398
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,800
Act calmly?

399
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Yes. You have to be as calm as possible.

400
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,810
Are you out shopping?

401
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,960
- No. I have plans with a friend.
- I see.

402
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,660
I also have plans with a friend.

403
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,390
But, Owner, who is that? He looks similar to Wu Gi.

404
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,340
You might be more shocked if you heard his name.

405
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,840
What is his name?

406
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,650
- Wu Gi.
- What?

407
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,260
His name is also Wu Gi. Ji Wu Gi.

408
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,080
He is the main character of the great flood incident that devastated the village three years ago.

Let's break up. I'm sorry.

410

I think this is it for us.

411
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,690
Let's talk some more.

00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,030
Wu Gi!

413
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,130
Yumi, you are really pretty.

414
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,560
1, 2, 3.

415
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:35,190
He is Yumi's ex-boyfriend, who stole away Yumi's 20s.

416
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,150
- Do you still live in Ilsan?
- Yes.

417
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,380
You said you would move because it is far from your work, but you are still there.

418
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,460
Is your workplace still the same?

419
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,860
Yes, I still work there.

420
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,050
Wait, wait. No,

421
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,460
if we keep talking we will be rolled into his conversation, so we need a more harsh attitude.

422
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,870
More harsh. More cocky. You know what I mean, right?

423
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,920
More harsh?

424
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,990
- Why? Why do you ask that?
- Huh?

425
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,440
Why do you want to know which company I work for?

426
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,900
That's right. I don't know why I asked either.

427
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,100
I think it was because I was surprised to suddenly see you.

428
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,810
I will be going now, since I came out to see a friend, too.

429
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh that's right, Yumi.

430
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,480
Your phone number hasn't changed, right?

431
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,280
Confusing Question
Level 2 Spying

432
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,450
A technique that leaves us not knowing whether he is going to call me some time

433
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,900
or asking if he can call.

434
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,790
- Is my number the same?
- Yes.

435
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,610
My number is the same, but why are you asking that?

436
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:56,430
Are you asking if my number is the same? Or are you indirectly asking if you can contact me?

437
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,870
If it's none of those, then are you saying you'll contact me in the future?

438
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:05,190
How is it that you haven't changed your ways of prying into people's emotions?

439
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,130
How is it that you haven't changed one bit from the past–

440
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,510
No! No!

441
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,700
Do you know how women get when you say things like that?

442
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,410
- No Reason, wait!
- Why do you always–

443
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:24,140
You can't say that! That's exactly the emotional reaction he wants right now.

444
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,010
It seems so, huh?

445
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,380
If you get caught up in those feelings, memories of the past will come up.

446
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,040
If you start recalling those memories, things will get out of hand.

447
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,250
Then what do we do?

448
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,830
- We'll use a level 1 defense technique.
- What?

449
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,220
Flat out rejection.

450
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Your phone number hasn't changed, right?

451
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,220
Yes. I'm saying this just in case,

452
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,790
if you have any thoughts of contacting me, I hope you don't.

Rejecting Him in Advance
Level 1 Defense

454
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:00,130
It's a shameless tactic used to block any further conversation.

455
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,680
Of course, I'm sure you wouldn't.

456
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,930
Yumi. Why are you being so harsh?

457
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,220
Fine, then, I'll go.

458
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,370
By the way, you got prettier.

What's going on?

- Is it an earthquake again?
- The floor has been cracking here and there since earlier.

461
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:12,650
It's because her insides are boiling. Her buried anger must be rising.

462
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,320
What a bastard. Shameless bastard.

463
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,380
He has no conscience.

464
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:46,330
You got prettier? How dare he shamelessly say that to me?

465
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,280
Reason, I'm anxious because

466
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,550
I feel like Wu Gi is going to call us.

467
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,190
If he does we just won't pick up.

468
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,300
What if he sends us a message?

469
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,370
Whatever it is, I think Yumi will explode.

470
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,880
We told him not to call, so I doubt he will. If he's not stupid ...

471
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,770
- We're getting a call!
- Is that guy clueless?

472
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,230
It can't be.

473
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,210
If he calls me, he's dead–

474
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,660
Hong Na Ri

475
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,030
Hello? Yes, Na Ri.

476
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,780
Yumi, can you talk right now?

477
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,410
Yes, I got the wedding invitation today. It's so pretty.

478
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,240
Yes, are preparations going well?

479
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,900
The thing is there's something I need to tell you in advance.

480
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,510
It's about Wu Gi.

481
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,940
- Ji Wu Gi?
- Yes.

482
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,520
Wu Gi is also a classmate so we couldn't avoid inviting him.

483
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,280
We sent the invitation in the group chat, and he said he couldn't come.

484
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,410
- But—
- But?

485
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,020
He called today saying he would come after all.

486
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,930
- Today?
 - Yes, a while ago.

487
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,640
I was wondering if you'd be all right with it.

488
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,640
I see. What can I say?

489
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,970
I'm sorry. I can't possibly tell him not to come when he wants to.

490
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,910
Yes, I get it.

491
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,420
That jerk is going to Na Ri's wedding? He's crazy, crazy! Why would he go there?

492
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,170
I knew this would happen. I was anxious.

493
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,470
No, no. We can never see that jerk again!

494
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,320
No! No!

495
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,000
But we can't miss Na Ri's wedding!

496
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,050
If we see him, I feel like he's going to pull something again. You saw his face earlier, right?

497
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,980
We need to go to the wedding, but we need an secret weapon.

498
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,660
- An secret weapon?
- A weapon that will end Wu Gi in one shot.

499
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,580
Wung, come and eat.

500
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,430
I'm fine, this is enough.

501
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,350
Hey Yumi, I'm still at the office.

502
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,990
I have a favor to ask, Wung.
 - A favor?

503
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:37,830
No matter how busy you are, I need you to set aside just one hour to come to my friend's wedding.

504
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,370
Oh, that?

505
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,480
- I don't know, I think I can find out next week–
- No! You have to come!

506
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,190
You have to come, Wung you have to! This is important.

507
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,640
You need to come and prove your existence.

508
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,470
If you really like me, you have to do this for me.

509
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:59,420
You don't need to get me anything for my birthday, anniversary, or Christmas; instead, just do this for me!

510
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,110
You can't just show up. You have to wash up, shave,

511
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:08,390
wear a proper suit and show up in a grand manner. Got it?

512
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,520
And I'm telling you in advance but I'm also going to catch the bouquet.

513
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,290
- Why would you?
- But don't take it in a weird way.

514
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,970
There's a reason that I need to catch it.

515
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,540
Yumi, why are you so worked up?

516
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,460
Wung, you're my boyfriend!

517
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,480
You need to come to my friend's wedding as my boyfriend.

518
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,480
You need to come and defeat all those terrible incarnations of jealousy. Got it, Wung?

519
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,530
Promise me.

520
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,190
Promise me.

521
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,650
Episode 20
My Friend's Wedding

522
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:52,980
Friend's Wedding D-7

523
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,680
Since I'm going with Wung, I need to look perfect.

524
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,650
But I have nothing to wear.

525
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,940
Okay, I need to buy clothes right away.

526
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,090
Buy them tomorrow. The credit card bill is too high for this month, so we can't.

527
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,890
No it'll be too late! If the size doesn't fit, what are you going to do?

528
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:19,640
Extra! Extra!

529
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,450
Her ex boyfriend Wu Gi is coming to her friend's wedding! Extra! Extra!

530
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,870
Yes, but what does this have to do with buying new clothes?

531
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,780
Huh?

532
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:37,000
It matters a lot, don't you think?

533
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,250
Friend's Wedding D-6

534
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:05,140
Eonnis, Section Chief! Today there's steak in the cafeteria menu!

535
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,380
Steak? What? They must be insane today.

536
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,850
- We have to have steak.
- Let's go. Let's go quickly before it's all gone.

537
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:15,340
You're a fool if you don't eat lunch at the cafeteria today.

538
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,220
- Hurry.
- Yumi, let's go.

539
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,650
Steak, steak! Are you not coming? Sorry, I'm leaving!

540
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,770
Why did it have to be steak?

541
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:32,450
Vegetable lunchbox

542
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,280
Now repeat after me. I am a herbivore.

543
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,740
I am a herbivore.

544
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,040
I like greens.

545
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,450
I like...

546
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,850
No! I hate this! I hate greens! I want to eat steak too!

547
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:18,680
Extra! Extra! Everyone, her ex-boyfriend Wu Gi is coming to her friend's wedding! Extra!

548
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,840
You heard that, right?

549
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:35,720
I'm a herbivore. I like greens.

550
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,880
I like greens.

551
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,030
I'm not sure, I haven't counted.

552
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,010
I'm full.

553
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,250
Assistant Manager Kim, is that enough for lunch?

554
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,740
I must be a herbivore, I like greens so much.

555
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,630
I don't think so, that's the face of someone eating poison.

556
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:10,750
Friend's Wedding D-5

557
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,440
That should be 10,000 steps, right?

558
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,650
Please work harder.

559
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,300
What, I'm still at 9,000?

560
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:31,040
I'll go around one more time.

561
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:56,400
I only ate vegetables and walked all day long. I'm so exhausted.

562
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,050
I don't even have the strength to wash up.

563
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:04,970
Please sign this petition so Yumi will put on a face mask tonight!

564
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,120
I'm tired, what face pack?

565
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,260
I still haven't gotten any signatures yet.

566
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,890
What do I do now? Her skin will get all ruined.

567
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,680
Extra! Extra! Her ex-boyfriend, Wu Gi is coming to her friend's wedding!

568
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,920
- What?
- Extra! Extra!

569
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,680
Yumi Daily
'Wu Gi' is Coming!
Ex-Boyfriend Ji Wu Gi to Attend Na Ri's Wedding

570
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,960
Yeah.

571
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,130
I have to go in my best condition.

572
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,090
Wung and I

573
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:39,450
have to be the most radiant couple.

574
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,470
The most radiant.

575
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,280
Friend's Wedding - D-1

576
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,420
Friend's Wedding - D-Day

577
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,250
My skin is nice and moist.

578
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,720
- Is that good?
 - It's perfect!

579
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,950
Hey, Wung. When are you coming? I'm ready.

580
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,960
- I'm sorry, Yumi, but can you go ahead first?
- Why?

581
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,980
I'm almost finished, but there's an issue with the last part. I'll head over as soon as I fix it.

582
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,260
Did you stay up the whole night? You said you'd finish it by yesterday.

583
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,040
A problem occurred so we couldn't. I just need to say hello, right?

584
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,510
I don't need to be there for the whole wedding.

585
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,680
That's true, but...

586
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,660
I'll go the second I'm finished. Sorry.

587
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,670
See you there.

588
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,940
What time is the wedding?

589
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,980
At one. Let's hurry.

590
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,110
Eat one of these to wake up.

591
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,000
You don't even know that person. Do you have to go to her wedding?

592
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,780
It's my Yumi's wish. I have to go since it's her wish.

593
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,960
I told you this when you went on the blind date.

594
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,340
A woman her age is already thinking of marriage when she agrees to blind dates.

595
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,100
Yumi is probably thinking seriously about marriage.

596
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,350
Probably not.

597
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:28,560
Idiot. That's what it means to go to a wedding together.

598
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,230
That's why she's introducing you to her colleagues.

599
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,480
I guess that's true.

600
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,040
At our age, how long we've dated isn't too important.

601
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,010
Well, it wouldn't matter if you were also thinking of marriage, but you're not.

602
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,640
Do you think about it?

603
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,100
If not, it might be better not to go.

604
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,190
- We're busy as it is.
- We are busy.

605
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,890
If you don't go, we don't need to rush to finish this.

606
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,090
Are you guys pressuring me?

607
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,680
It's because we care about you.

608
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,120
It's a good excuse.

609
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,800
I mean it's because we're so busy.

610
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,240
Nuptial Mass
Groom Shin Hyo Jo / Bride Hong Na Ri

611
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,860
Hey, Yumi!

612
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,660
Sang Su, it's been so long!

613
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,940
You're looking great today, Kim Yumi.

614
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,320
Yeah, right.

615
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,680
- I'm serious!
- You're totally...

616
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,220
Nah, that's not true.

617
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,740
I'll see you later, I have to go say hi to Na Ri.

618
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,240
All right, bye.

619
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:51,900
- Was Yumi always that pretty?
- Yumi was always pretty.

620
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,330
Why did I have to see him first? It put me in a bad mood.

621
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,200
I should've come with Wung.

622
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,310
Na Ri!

623
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,640
Yumi!

624
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,640
Na Ri, you look so pretty! Seriously, congratulations!

625
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,080
Seriously, thanks!

626
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,280
- Let's take a picture first.
- Ah, yes.

627
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,430
- Sit. Sit.
- You should come too, Si Yeon.

628
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,720
Come on, hurry. Take it with us.

629
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,570
Where's your boyfriend?

630
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:22,040
Oh, yes! You said you would come with your boyfriend. Where is he?

631
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,160
He's on his way. He had some work.

632
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,750
Is he really coming?

633
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,120
It's what I said.

634
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,070
I'm not leaving until he shows up.

635
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,080
I'll take the picture now. Look into the camera!

636
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,650
One, two, three!

637
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,080
Wung, why aren't you coming?

638
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,420
I'm on my way, just got into a taxi. Sorry!

639
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,310
I'm sitting in the front row.

640
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,070
Got it.

641
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,200
You are wearing a suit, right?

642
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,250
No.

643
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,820
What?

644
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,780
There didn't have any summer suits, so I'm just wearing what I already had.

645
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,600
What could it be? I know all his clothes.

646
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,510
What the hell is he wearing?

647
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,560
What you already had?

648
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,590
It's something I bought a few days ago. You haven't seen it.

649
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,890
He bought it?

650
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:38,620
What did he buy instead of a suit?

651
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,670
You should've bought a suit with that money!

652
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,890
No way. He won't wear whatever, right?

653
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,790
Like on our blind date?

654
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,370
No, no, no! You need to look at it for a long time to tell that he did an effortless look.

655
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,040
That will never work here!

656
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,310
What do we do? What do we do? How do we go about this?

657
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:02,100
Wait. Won't they be less disappointed if I lower their expectations?

658
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,980
Fishing cell! Help me!

659
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,080
With what?

660
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,240
Throw some bait to lower everyone's expectations!

661
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,400
Okay.

662
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:18,090
Just when is he coming? Your boyfriend?

663
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,820
Right, when is he coming?

664
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,160
I'm really curious.

665
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,620
He's coming soon.

666
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:30,780
But, girls, my boyfriend has absolutely zero interest in fashion.

667
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,920
He's the type to completely absorb himself into work.

668
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,520
He's a sort of workaholic, you know?

669
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,700
Really?

670
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,200
What does he do?

671
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,770
He's a game developer.

672
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,140
You can say he favors a plain style.

673
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,170
Still, he's very nice.

674
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,350
He just has no interest in fashion.

675
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,010
No that's not it.

676
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,090
If it's the guy I saw in the photo,

677
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,380
he had a very unique style.

678
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,170
- Really? Wow.
- I'm really looking forward to seeing him.

679
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,790
He's coming soon.

680
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,480
I can't wait to see him.

681
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,160
Hey!

682
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,050
Wung probably washed his hair, right?

683
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,100
You usually can't if you stay up all night working.

684
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,950
No way! Don't look down on Wung.

685
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,920
My Wung is great at cleaning himself up!

686
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:26,230
Wung, you know how you said you stayed at the office all night?

687
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,600
Yeah.

688
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,880
Then is your hair...

689
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,460
So I couldn't even wash my hair, LOL.

690
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,080
But it's not that obvious, hahaha.

691
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,480
About my boyfriend,

692
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,730
he had to stay overnight at the office last night.

693
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,220
He's been so busy these days.

694
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,980
So he might not look the best.

695
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,260
He's just so busy these days.

696
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,290
Well, my boyfriend is the same when he's busy.

697
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:06,550
Really? Right?

698
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:11,020
That's right, even my husband doesn't have time to shave some mornings.

699
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,850
That's not right.

700
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,060
He should shave, at the very least.

701
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,910
- Don't attack my husband.
- When the hair stands up like a lead pencil,

702
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,510
do you think it looks good?

703
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,280
For me, guys who don't shave...

704
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,640
Wung, did you shave...

705
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,710
Shave?

706
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,910
Oh, yes, I forgot to shave.

707
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,210
I forgot. I forgot.

708
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,900
I forgot. I forgot.

709
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,820
I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot.

710
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,850
Then what the hell did he do?

711
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,360
What am I supposed to do if he comes without shaving?

712
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:49,080
Yumi, isn't that Ji Wu Gi?

713
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,590
He's still handsome as ever.

714
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:59,670
There's a light shining from him. He's handsome.

715
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:06,500
That's it! That was how I wanted Wung to come today, so why is that dude wearing that?

716
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,500
Her ex and current boyfriend are going to be heavily compared. What do we do?

717
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,730
Guys, I think we'll be embarrassed. What do we do?

718
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,640
Should we just tell him not to come?

719
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,440
Honestly, I don't want him to come.

720
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,230
How could we say that, after begging a busy man to come?

721
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:29,370
He's already late, let's just tell him to take his time.

722
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:35,130
Wung, if there's traffic, you can take your time. No need to rush.

723
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,480
There's actually so much traffic right now.

724
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:40,860
All right, then. Don't push yourself too hard —

725
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,630
So I got off the taxi and I'm running there.

726
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,440
You're running?

727
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,030
You'll sweat if you run.

728
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,650
His hair is already greasy.

729
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,990
Now there's going to be sweat on it, too?

730
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:10,330
You need to give up on everything to feel at ease.

731
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,470
Good, repeat after me.

732
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:14,480
Let things be.

733
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,220
Let things be.

734
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,740
Let things be.

735
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,200
Let things be.

736
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,020
Girls,

737
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:34,080
I'm letting you know in advance. Some beggar is going to come in.

738
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,130
A beggar?

739
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,140
Yes, but don't be too surprised.

740
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,700
That beggar is my boyfriend.

741
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,790
010-649-946

742
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:51,820
Yumi, it's Wu Gi.

743
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,310
Are you busy?

744
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,520
If it's all right with you, do you want to meet up before it starts?

745
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,400
I'll wait for you in the back yard of the cathedral.

746
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,200
You came. I thought you wouldn't.

747
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,650
Guys, is everyone ready?

748
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,540
You all heard that the Wung we trusted is coming here looking like a beggar, right?

749
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,790
- We did!
- We did!

750
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,640
There's nobody to help us.

751
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,780
- We don't need them, either.
- Right!

752
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,580
So, we're going to work together to take him down!

753
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,530
That bastard!

754
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,050
Take him down! That bastard!

755
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,420
- Is everyone holding their bombs?
- Yes!

756
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,670
Ji Wu Gi is a strong opponent. The longer the conversation, the more disadvantageous it gets for us.

757
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,680
So, there is only one plan!

758
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,120
The second he acts funny, we will attack him with our profanity bombs and end it there!

759
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,920
- Understand?
- Okay!

760
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,250
This place is still the same. Nothing's changed at all.

761
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,690
Why did you call me here?

762
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:26,010
Don't you remember this place? Seonbae Hyeon Su got married here, too.

763
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:29,600
How many years has it been?

764
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,630
After the wedding, we were there together and...

765
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,400
Don't you remember?

766
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,950
He's bringing up memories again.

767
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,420
It's coming up soon, right?

768
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:51,270
The second he pulls the "I thought of you" or "I want to start over" talk,

769
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:54,990
- we throw the bombs immediately.
- Got it!

770
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,630
We were so innocent back then.

771
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,620
Why did you call me here?

772
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,920
I asked, why did you call me here?

773
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,410
- If you're going to waste my time bringing up the past —
- I had something to tell you.

774
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,030
Excuse me.

775
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:19,980
Yes?

776
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:24,020
Are you Kim Yumi's friends?

777
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,530
Something to say?

778
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,180
Well...

779
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,710
Could you make it quick? I have to go back.

780
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,820
Yumi.

781
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,120
Now, get ready ...

782
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:47,400
I'm getting married soon.

783
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,660
What?

784
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,160
I'm getting married in the spring. March.

785
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,750
With whom?

786
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,700
With that woman?

787
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,220
He's getting married to her?

788
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,980
That bastard is a bastard to the end!

789
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,840
- You!
- Eh?

790
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,580
Ow, that hurt!

791
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,000
Sensitivity, where are you going?

792
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:28,560
Really?

793
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,960
Oh. I see.

794
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,570
But why are you telling me?

795
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:38,880
I need to tell our classmates soon, but I didn't think it would be polite

796
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,130
to let you hear it from others.

797
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:43,680
- Polite?
- I heard you were coming to the wedding,

798
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,190
so I thought it worked out well.

799
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,860
Yumi, are you all right?

800
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,410
About what?

801
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:01,600
You look so shocked. You're fine, right?

802
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,280
I was a little worried because I thought you might have a hard time.

803
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:14,450
What the hell is that crazy bastard saying?

804
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:30,930
Yumi, I'm going to cherish my time with you forever as the brightest moments of my life.

805
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:34,610
You were the blessing in my twenties.

806
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:39,210
So, I hope you're not too shocked.

807
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,200
Why would I be shocked?

808
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,090
We're at the age to get married.

809
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,480
Actually, I'm getting married soon, too.

810
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,960
- Really?
- Yes.

811
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,000
I think I'll do it next year as well.

812
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,440
But you'll probably be first.

813
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,670
Sensitivity! Where did she go?

814
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,890
She's getting married next year?

815
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,170
What?

816
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,150
Really?

817
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:23,600
Wow, really? To whom?

818
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,000
What do you think? To a man.

819
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,090
I've been dating for a while now, too.

820
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:32,740
Who is lying right now?

821
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,020
I am, why?

822
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,890
She's causing trouble again!

823
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:41,080
You still haven't heard? I told Na Ri and the others.

824
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,100
His sense of style is awful but he's nice.

825
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,840
That's enough, isn't it? Haha.

826
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,330
Sensitvity, you can't just say whatever you want!

827
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,300
No matter how angry you are!

828
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:54,350
So what? We can't just sit idly when that bastard is bragging about getting married. We need to do it too!

829
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,910
He proposed to me.

830
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,740
Sensitivity, stop it!

831
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,760
He said life without me was meaningless, or something like that.

832
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,250
Sensitivty, stop right there!

833
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,860
Hey! Stop!

834
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:06,120
It hasn't been long since I was proposed to.

835
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,260
Oh, I forgot my ring.

836
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,620
We're thinking of dates right now. Late spring at the earliest?

837
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,260
No, it could actually be in the summer.

838
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:19,170
My boyfriend is trying to rush into things.

839
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:22,240
I want to take my time with marriage,

840
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,470
but I don't think it's right to make him wait so long.

841
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:28,490
Where are you getting married? Send me an invitation.

842
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:31,340
Sorry, but I don't think I can invite you.

843
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,420
Actually, we're planning on going abroad to have a small wedding.

844
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,600
My boyfriend likes romantic things.

845
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,640
We're thinking about Hawaii for the location.

846
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,700
Seriously! Stop it now!

847
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,590
Enough!

848
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,300
No!

849
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,100
I guess it's starting. We should go back.

850
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,630
Anyway, congrats.

851
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,820
It's Wung!

852
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,560
It's Wung! Wung! He heard everything!

853
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,600
You screwed up big time! It's all your fault!

854
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,190
What are you going to do now?

855
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,810
Wung!

856
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:26,650
Yumi, I was looking for you.

857
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,610
You said you were inside.

858
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,980
Are you, by any chance,

859
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,930
Yumi's boyfriend?

860
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,600
- Yes.
- Hello, I'm Yumi's ...

861
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,360
friend. We're all the bride's old classmates.

862
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,070
I see. Hello, I'm Gu Wung.

863
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:52,860
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ji Wu Gi.

864
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,720
You're very...

865
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,100
What?

866
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:05,270
Cool. Your style isn't awful.

867
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,400
I'm sorry?

868
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,460
And I'd like to congratulate you.

869
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,550
For what?

870
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,210
I heard you're getting married soon.

871
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,400
Oh no! Oh no!

872
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,990
What do we do? What do we do?

873
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:28,610
What do we do now?

874
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:36,990
I just heard that you're getting married next year.

875
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,250
Yes, thank you.

There are rumors that your boyfriend is so cool!

He's so much better in real life.

Are you getting married to Sunbae Yumi? Really?

I don't regret it. I'm sure about Wung now.

What?

891
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,420
It's nothing.

892
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,120
