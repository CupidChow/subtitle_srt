Yumi
A tvN original series

2
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,230
Yumi's Cells

00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,070
Episode 27
The History of "Aegyo*" ( Cuteness, acting cute)

4
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,640
The great encyclopedia of Yumi, volume 32, chapter 12.

5
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,490
Today, to wrap up the year, I'm going to describe Yumi's history of aegyo..

6
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,720
Yumi's history of aegyo.

7
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,990
Primary cell Love is good at everything, the only weakness she has...

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,060
There's nothing better than aegyo to make a relationship easier.

9
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,930
Aegyo? That's the only thing I can't do.

10
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,560
Idiot. If you can't do it, you have to at least try.

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,470
Ask for a teacher.

12
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,410
It's been a while since they started dating. How long are you going to last without aegyo?

13
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,870
A teacher?

14
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,380
Me, Detective, I recommend Ruby as a private tutor.

15
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,090
The technique Lee Ruby, the queen of aegyo, usually uses is...

16
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,070
Oppa Wu Gi!

17
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,970
Oh no, I said "oppa" again.

18
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,530
- Hello!
- Hello.

19
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,400
Uh? Are you giving me this coffee?

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,650
No, this is mine.

21
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,700
Oh, please give that to me.

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,720
The claw of love. A technique used to nag someone.

23
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,410
If you get caught properly, you'll even give up your soul.

24
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,310
I want to drink that.

25
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,650
Ruby, you can just make another cup of coffee.

26
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,890
It's a joke!

27
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,180
A spike serve on your shoulder.

28
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,260
Physical contact and aegyo are a two-in-one technique.

29
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,080
I have mine here.

30
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,370
Uh? Why can't I open this?

31
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,400
The Love drink lid technique.

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
A basic technique using the psychology of men who respond to the lid that doesn't open.

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,410
I guess it's too tight.

34
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,160
- My arm hurts.
- It's not opening? Give it to me.

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,320
It's fine, Ruby can do it too.

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,360
Call yourself by your own name, a dark acting cute technique.

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,260
A secret technique used among cringey couples.

38
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,790
I said Ruby can do it too.

39
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,280
What did you just say?

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,000
You just got goosebumps, huh?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,790
I did it to make you laugh.

42
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,440
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

43
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,790
Watch carefully. She's drawing his attention.

44
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,520
Yesterday, I dreamt of you.

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,150
She's using an unreasonable amount of aegyo.

46
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,020
I'm joking! 
Spike serve on his shoulder.

47
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,850
This is exactly Ruby's killer move.

48
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,850
An infinite loop of aegyo that never ends.

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,420
Oh, I see.

50
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,450
Let's go eat.

51
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,820
Yes, let's go.

52
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,900
Excuse me, Ruby. Are you busy?

53
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,500
- Eonni, how do I look?
- Uh?

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,530
It's my first time trying this.

55
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,250
Isn't it perfect for Ruby?

56
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,260
Ah... You're right.

57
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,870
It's perfect for you. It's pretty, it's pretty.

58
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,070
I completely love it!

59
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,650
- By the way, Ruby, are you busy?
- Uh?

60
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,830
So after starting dating, Love took Ruby, who was once her rival, as a teacher.

61
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,790
She decided to learn how to be aegyo from her.

62
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,800
First of all, there's the 'spike serve on your shoulder' technique for beginners.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,690
- "Spike serve on your shoulder"?
- Yes.

64
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,480
It's not really difficult.

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,970
While giggling, you slap his shoulder.

66
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,690
Next.

67
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,300
How is it? Easy, right?

68
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,800
There's no problem if you use just this one to show your cuteness.

69
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,250
Try it out with your boyfriend. I'm sure he's going to go crazy and say that you're cute.

70
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,690
But, I don't really think that's my style ...

71
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,890
Oh, my. This Eonni is blunt. Is that how you are?

72
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,450
You have to work hard to be aegyo.

73
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,990
Did you think everyone is born with it?

74
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,540
Should we try it now? Should we try it?

75
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,860
Oh but, Wung is wearing a sleeveless shirt today.

76
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,160
Won't it hurt if we do the serve?

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,950
That's true, but it's not polite to hit bare skin with your palm.

78
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,230
- Then don't do it?
- Never, never!

79
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,050
That's right. Don't do it. It's going to be gross if I do it.

80
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,620
What?

81
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,830
If this is hard for you,

82
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,970
then, I'll teach you the beginners' technique called 'Lid of the drink of Love' .

83
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,690
Watch carefully.

84
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,300
Like this, you attract him with your frail side.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,220
Why can't I open it?

86
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,950
That's even harder to do. I don't think that's for me.

87
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,240
There's nothing you can't do. Try it, quickly!

88
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,810
Grab it and...

89
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,270
Yumi are you hot? Do you want some of the Cola we bought earlier?

90
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,880
You have to keep doing it to improve your skill.

91
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,490
Wung! I'll open it.

92
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,270
I think we can do this.

93
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,650
Let's call Right Hand!

94
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,570
So, you're asking me to turn it as weak as possible?

95
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,460
What? Don't open the lid? But pretend to put strength into it?

96
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,570
Why are there so many requests? I got it, I got it.

97
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,600
Hey guys! Open the lid with weak strength but don't open it.

98
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,890
Pretend to put strength into it, but don't open it. Got it?

99
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,630
What the hell? Do we open the lid or not?

100
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,070
Just pretend to turn the lid using a really weak force.

101
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,940
I said to use a really weak force!

102
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,440
- That delicious Cola!
- It's overflowing!

103
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,900
What a waste!

104
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,360
♫ I also wouldn't know my heart ♫

105
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,590
That's cute!

106
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,570
Why are you so cute, huh?

107
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,500
He said that was cute. That was cute!

108
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,290
It's not thanks to "aegyo".

109
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,600
It worked because it was really aegyo. As long as it is aegyo!

110
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,390
But, Detective. I don't think Ruby's aegyo skill is right for me.

111
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,100
Can I change my teacher?

112
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,730
In the end, Love decided to study how to be aegyo on her own.

113
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,530
What about this one? It seems fine.

114
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,990
- Which one?
- The half-tongue technique.

115
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,170
A beginner aegyo technique in which you use only half of your tongue to talk,

116
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,930
it's a long-loved classic technique.

117
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,800
Thank you!

118
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,200
I'll unwrap it for you.

119
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,200
- It's good.
- Yes.

120
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,770
Ah, it's hot!

121
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,060
Love, the moment is now! Let's try it!

122
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,620
Honey, are you hurt?

123
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,790
Wung! Are you hurt?

124
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,140
What?

125
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,540
Are you hurt?

126
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,020
I'll blow on it!

127
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,270
It's a joke.

128
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,070
Joke, joke, joke!

129
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,190
It's weird! It's freaking weird!

130
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,840
Idiot. It's because Yumi didn't pull it off properly.

131
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,340
I feel I'm going crazy.

132
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,410
Silence! What about this one? You don't need to talk with this one.

133
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,140
There's one that doesn't require talking? That's good!

134
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,930
The cat's greeting. Approach the other person and rub yourself on him like a cat.

135
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,500
Meow, meow.

136
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,830
That's crazy. It seems even more difficult.

137
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,820
Let's just try it once!

138
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,320
What's wrong?

139
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,370
What are you doing?

140
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,720
It's static electricity.

141
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,210
Look at this,. My hair is stuck.

142
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,020
It is funny.

143
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,970
Look at this.

144
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,750
I cannot do it.

145
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,590
You are going to give up?

146
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,750
Sorry. Yumi's rigid body cannot handle these skills.

147
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,040
Yumi was born that way.

148
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,320
It will work if you put in the effort. There's no person in the world who's born without aegyo.

149
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,440
There is! That is Yumi!

150
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,560
And that is me!

151
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,810
Love!

152
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,010
I cannot give up.

153
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,070
Wait, Love, wait.

154
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,980
Then, let's at least try this. I really think we can do this.

155
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,820
There is none. There is no aegyo that Yumi can do.

156
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,620
No, this is aegyo for beginners.

157
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,410
It says you can do it even if you can't speak with half your tongue and if your body is stiff.

158
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,120
There isn't anything that is easier than this.

159
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,590
The smart shoulder technique.

160
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,970
It's a beginner technique where you call on the other person by knocking on their shoulder.

161
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,050
The point is to say "Knock Knock."

162
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,900
If we can't even do this, let's give up, Yumi.

163
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,790
Knock, knock.

164
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,550
What? Is something not working well?

165
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,720
This is just...

166
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,870
but what was that?

167
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,420
Knock, knock. It was funny.

168
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,440
This?

169
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,850
Knock, knock.

170
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,820
So cute.

171
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,360
Cute?

172
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,780
Knock, knock.

173
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,920
She did it. Yumi did it without being awkward.

174
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,660
Yes, it was very natural.

175
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
Yumi did it!

176
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,740
Be confident, Love.

177
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:56,140
There are aegyo techniques that suit even someone with a stiff body. You just have to find it.

178
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,180
I think you can let me down now.

179
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,190
Okay!

180
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,380
Knock, knock.

181
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,940
Did you wait long?

182
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,500
Sit down. What is this?

183
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,460
Love finally got the hang of aegyo with the smart knock technique,

184
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,570
and after a lot of trial and error,

185
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,090
she began to develop Yumi's own aegyo technique rather than borrowing it from elsewhere.
[Yumi's Aegyo Techniques]

186
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,410
And now in the present...

187
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,380
Ajeossi, can you go a bit faster? I am very late.

188
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,810
Oh, yes. We are almost there.

189
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,150
What do I do? Wung would be mad.

190
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,900
Wung!

191
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,390
I'm so sorry. You waited long right?

192
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,030
Section Chief Nam would not let me go.

193
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,410
You should have told me sooner if you were going to be late.

194
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,850
He made it seem like it would end fast.

195
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,050
But why were you waiting outside?

196
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,000
They told me to get out because I didn't order anything.

197
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,720
Really? So you were standing outside the whole time?

198
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,230
I didn't know when you would come.

199
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,700
- Let's go in right away.
- No.

200
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,730
I don't like that place. Let's eat something else.

201
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,110
What do we do? What do we do?

202
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,740
Wung usually doesn't get mad but he must be really upset.

203
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,010
Guys, do not worry.

204
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,350
- I can take care of this.
- How?

205
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,380
Yumi has her own special aegyo skills.

206
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,710
Here we go! "Wu Ju Ju"!

207
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:01,430
Yumi's aegyo to melt the other person's heart like a baby.

208
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,720
Aigoo. What do we do?

209
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,610
You were waiting outside even though it was cold?

210
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,180
Wung, should we eat mackerel?

211
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,500
Mackerel?

212
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,880
The mackerel that Wung likes. Do you like mackerel?

213
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,450
I don't think it is working.

214
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,330
Nope.

215
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,380
This is a combination skill. Add one more.

216
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,450
Let's go. Oh gu gu*!
"Oh gu Oh gu" baby talk.
(sounds like the numbers 5959)

217
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,250
Yumi's cute act skill where she shows affection like an older sister.
[Ohgu ohgu]

218
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,510
Ohgu ohgu!

219
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,070
What are you doing?

220
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,860
How cold and hungry our Wung must have been while waiting.

221
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,260
Wung's cheeks are so cold.

222
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,080
You went through a lot. I am sorry, my Wung.

223
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,570
Buy something tasty.

224
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,600
You like mackerel.

225
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,550
Something tastier.

226
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,430
All right. I will buy everything delicious for my Wung. Let's go.

227
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,410
I was so cold.

228
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,180
What if I do this?

229
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,840
It is a bit better.

230
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,390
What about doing this?

231
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,400
I like it more.

232
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,710
The crab walk.

233
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,030
Yumi's cute act of hugging the other person's waist and walking sideways.

234
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,860
Thrilling Static Electricity.

235
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,810
Yumi's cute act of rubbing her head against the person and causing static electricity to make them laugh.

236
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,210
Look at that.

237
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,950
Yumi's aegyo skills, which have grown into her own independent brand,

238
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,070
are expected to further improve next year.

239
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,940
Yumi's history of aegyo is over. Recorded by Reason.

240

Episode 28
Compliment delivery and Cinderella's Potion

241
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,290
Are you drinking coffee?

242
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,890
Yes. I guess the heat is too high. I keep feeling sleepy.

243
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,770
That's right.

244
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,290
Do you want some coffee?

245
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,320
I'll do it.

246
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,410
How was your Christmas?

247
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,800
Yes. What about you, Assistant Manager Yu?

248
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,870
Mine wasn't great.

249
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,390
- You didn't go on a date?
- Reporters are busier at the end of the year.

250
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,020
Our plans were suddenly canceled, so I cooked and ate at home by myself.

251
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,370
I made a tartar sauce with your recipe.

252
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,680
I see.

253
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,130
Aigoo.

254
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,140
- Don't we have to say this at times like that?
- Pardon?

255
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,620
I saw your post. Was it last week? The keyword was "Aigoo."

256
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,270
What? You saw my post?

257
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,650
- Yes, I accidentally found it on an employee's account last time.
- My goodness.

258
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,880
Actually, I'm an enthusiastic subscriber. I press "Like" every day.

259
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,850
Why? I'm just writing down useless things. Don't look at it.

260
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,140
Why? It's fun. You're a great writer.

261
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,530
There is something called the 'compliment delivery'.

262
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,770
Delivery!

263
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,730
Wow, it's the compliment delivery!

264
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,200
If you get a compliment, it is delivered to the cell who made it happen.

265
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,720
And there's a spirit in the delivery box.

266
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,550
Hi! I'll give you a gift.

267
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,710
Wow, a gift! I'm so excited!

268
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,530
The spirit gives a gift to the cells.

269
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,670
Section Chief, this is the data you asked for yesterday. Here you are.

270
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,960
Oh, thank you.

271
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,820
Assistant Manager Kim, you're so meticulous.

272
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,670
Reason, here's a delivery for you!

273
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,230
It's a compliment delivery!

274
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,290
- Here you are.
- Thank you!

275
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,050
I'm excited! I'll have to wish to raise my concentration.

276
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,370
Uh? What's that? Where's the spirit?

277
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,630
Deliveries without spirits are fake ones.

278
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,440
Getting compliment delivery with spirit in it isn't an easy thing.

279
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,590
I don't really know...

280
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,850
If I write well or not.

281
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,760
You do.

282
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,820
Your posts are... How should I put this?

283
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,550
It's difficult to explain, but they seem to be just like you.

284
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,360
What do you mean by just like me?

285
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,210
It's a good meaning.

286
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,950
Compliment delivery!

287
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,620
- It's for me?
- Yes, Writer, that's a compliment delivery for you.

288
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,450
Hi!

289
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,730
Wow, it's a good dream. Is this real?

290
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,060
On that day, we received our first compliment delivery in a while.

291
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,590
Ah... Thank you.

292
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,110
- So I'm wondering, can you write something for me?
- Sorry?

293
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,200
Our marketing department is trying to renew our company's social media account.

294
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,020
I thought it would be nice if you could take charge of it.

295
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,220
- Pardon?
- I think your writing style would fit well.

296
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,980
How could I...? I'm not even from the marketing department.

297
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,990
That's not important. We need someone who writes well and knows the company's products well.

298
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,290
I think Assistant Manager Kim would do well.

299
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,930
I'll give you a gift!

300
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,560
- What's that?
- It's Cinderella's potion.

301
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,480
Cinderella's potion?

302
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,260
It raises your self-esteem to the highest level until midnight.

303
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,560
- Really?
- Then, bye!

304
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,850
Let's see... Cinderella's potion effect is... What?

305
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,560
With the genius talent that is equivalent to Shakespeare,

306
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,010
everything you write touches everyone's heart,

307
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,330
and it's the sort of thing that makes you look forward to a Nobel Prize.

308
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,760
That's the illusion caused by Cinderella's potion.

309
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,070
Do you want to give it a try?

310
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,730
When is it due?

311
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,520
The sooner, the better, but do as you please.

312
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,900
- I'll give it to you by tonight.
- Tonight?

313
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,620
You said it just has to be three or four lines. I'll give it a try. I think I can do it.

314
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,330
See you tomorrow.

315
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,900
I'll get going now.

316
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,900
A light greeting.

317
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,290
He said it just needs to be three or four lines.

318
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,370
It's a three or four line greeting.

319
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:46,200
Since it's 6 o'clock right now, let's finish it by 6:30 and go home.

320
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,590
- 30 min?
- Yes, that's enough.

321
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,930
But it's not our personal account, it's for work. Shouldn't you put more effort into it?

322
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,830
It will take me thirty minutes because I'm putting effort into it. Usually, it wouldn't take more than ten minutes.

323
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,500
- I see. Is there something we might help you—
- No.

324
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,610
I got it. Then good luck, Writer.

325
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,800
So, shall we begin?

326
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:19,080
A cheerful and trendy way of speaking would be great, right?

327
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,040
Should I use greetings that are popular these days?

328
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,130
Followers of Korean Noodles, hi!

329
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,340
Oh, that sounds nice. Since it's 'Korean Noodle'...

330
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,000
Korean Noodle Marketing Department SNS 1Q Promotional Post Draft - Soup Noodle
Guk Hi!

331
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,700
No, since it's 'Daehan'. Dae Hi...

332
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,640
That's not it.

333
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,840
It's our official account,

334
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,090
so it's kind of weird if it's not formal.

335
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,400
Hello.

336
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,570
But 'Hello' is too boring.

337
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,090
- Assistant Manager Kim, good work. I'm leaving.
- Good bye.

338
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,150
I ate everything. I'm hungry.

339
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,450
Reason, let's eat. I'm really hungry.

340
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,020
Oh, it's already past 7 o'clock. Is she not done yet?

341
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,720
Oh, I'm awake.

342
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,220
I'm getting back to my senses. Now I think I can write.

343
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,510
Writer?

344
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,250
Are you done?

345
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,980
I'm all done. Almost...

346
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,020
Really? It's been way more than 30 minutes.

347
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,890
So what?

348
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,410
Is that important? It's an official account, should I just scribble down anything?

349
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,740
Huh? Huh?

350
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,770
You shouldn't, of course.

351
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,890
It'll be done soon. So just wait a bit.

352
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,380
Then, good luck.

353
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,030
Why can't I think of anything?

354
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,640
It's weird.

355
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,780
Why are you like this Yumi? It's only three or four lines, why can't you write it? It doesn't make sense.

356
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,070
It's just three or four lines.

357
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,190
Writer, it's past 9 p.m., but you're still ...

358
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,820
Writer?

359
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,470
Writer, how is it coming along?

360
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,950
Yumi has to eat, go home and go to sleep.

361
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,260
Writer! Open the door!

362
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,640
This isn't an easy task.

363
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,490
It wasn't an easy task.

364
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:26,450
Should I have said I couldn't do it? I'm not even getting paid more by doing this.

365
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,650
Who gave Writer the Cinderella potion?

366
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,240
You should have declined in the first place. Why would the assistant manager of the accounting team be writing?

367
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,480
I'm hungry!

368
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,590
I'm dying!

369
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,870
When are we going home? Yumi still hasn't even washed up yet.

370
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,850
She'll ruin her skin.

371
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,460
She has to do laundry.

372
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,000
If she doesn't put her clothes in the washing machine today, she won't have underwear to wear tomorrow.

373
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,530
What?

374
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,790
Everyone!

375
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,320
We got a message from Wung.

376
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,070
What?

377
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,770
Yumi, are you home?

378
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,740
No, I'm still at work.

379
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,450
Oh. Why? Are you working overtime again?

380
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,020
Yes. I still have some work to do.

381
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,850
I see. I was thinking that if you were home, I could stop by to see you for a bit.

382
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,900
We have to see each other. Everyone, let's go see Wung.

383
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,330
- Yeah!
- Let's see Wung and get something to eat.

384
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,120
We have to do laundry, so let's order delivery.

385
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,070
Let's go home quickly!

386
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,690
Wait! You can't!

387
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,020
Why not!

388
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,350
Writer drank the Cinderella potion,

389
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,790
so we can't do what we want until the potion wears off.

390
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,530
That's not fair!

391
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,140
Writer! Stop and give up.

392
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,810
We have to go meet Wung!

393
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,700
I'm almost done! Just wait a little bit longer!

394
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,480
When are you going to be done?

395
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,040
Ten! Just give me until ten o'clock.

396
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,970
I just thought of something.

397
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,940
You're sure you'll be done at ten right?

398
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,330
Yes. 10 p.m. 10 p.m.

399
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,560
Wung, I think I'll be done by 10 p.m.

400
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,920
Yes.

401
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,550
Should we meet at 10:30?

402
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,800
Oh. There? Sure.

403
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,600
Got it.

Wung.

412

Why did I agree to do this?

When the clock rung midnight, the effects of the Cinderella potion wore off.

Assistant Manager Yu. You're probably asleep, so I am leaving you this message.

00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,550
I'm sorry. You recommended me,

The department head said since what you are doing right now is outside of normal work hours,

462
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,190
he's going to give you extra pay.

463
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,800
Extra pay?

464
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,420

Yes. I think you'll get quite a bit.

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,070
Stop!

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,740
There's no better motivation than compliments.

477
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,750
I'm done.

478
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,810
Episode 29
We Need to Have Courage

479
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,450
January

480
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,710
Here, a new year begins.

481
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:40,390
The first day of a new year. On the first day of the year, something interesting happens in the village.

482
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,940
I wonder who it'll be this year.

483
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,230
I hope it's me, please.

484
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,830
Don't you think it'll be me this year?

485
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:50,850
Writer, I also think it's you. It definitely you.

486
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,880
One of the already existing cells increases in size for three days.

487
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,510
Woah, I'm getting bigger!

488
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,110
Last year, and the year before that, it was the diet cell.

489
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,150
- Wow!
- You look cool!

490
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,700
I'm going to lose 3 kilograms this year for sure.

491
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,780
If you can't, you're not even human, Kim Yumi.

492
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,330
This year's motto is to be frugal.

493
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,550
Nobody even think about spending money.

494
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,280
Man, why does it have to be Stingy? I have to buy clothes.

495
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,760
Three years ago, it was the stingy cell.

496
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,880
This year, I will use my accounting book. I won't ever forget to use it.

497
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,650
However, this phenomenon disappears on its own after three days.

498
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,900
Huh?

499
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,950
Hey Stingy, it's been three days. Today is January 4th.

500
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,980
Yumi, let's go buy clothes!

501
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,710
So frustrating!

502
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:10,170
What the heck?

503
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,580
Oh, gosh. What is this?

504
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,740
Am I getting old?

505
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,020
I'm getting bigger!

506
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,220
Right. I made up my mind.

507
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,810
This year, I'm going to use one facial pack a day.

508
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,770
I'm so big! This is so exciting!

509
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,440
Look at Face Wash Up!

510
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,870
I'm going to buy 365 facial masks!

511
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:46,820
I'm even going to get massages! I'm going to sign up for coupons.

512
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,780
Face Wash Up! Will you calm down and hear me out?

513
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,360
No! I'm going to buy some facial packs!

514
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,370
I'm out of packs?

515
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,810
When did I run out?

516
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,320
This is why I look so old.

517
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,800
No, you can't buy facial packs.

518
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,010
She's going to turn back to normal within three days anyway!

519
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,100
We just need to last three days. Just have her buy three.

520
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,250
What did you say?

521
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,670
I will also join the one-pack-a-day campaign. Please let me go.

522
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,580
- Are you telling the truth?
- Of course.

523
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,230
Did I buy too many?

524
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,790
No, I need to stock up so I'm motivated not to waste it.

525
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,630
Hey, Wung. Are you done with work?

526
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,020
Yeah, I'm at home.

527
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,740
Really?

528
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,360
Wung!

529
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,680
What is that?

530
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,540
Those years of humiliation are finally over!

531
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:50,160
This year is the year of hair! I'll raise them like a beast.

532
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,160
How could the worst one be picked?

533
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,800
Let's stay calm. We only need to wait three days.

534
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,630
It's only three days anyway.

535
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,820
What is that, Wung?

536
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,550
Are you growing a beard?

537
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,730
You noticed.

538
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,020
It would be weirder if I didn't notice.

539
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,500
It's been a while since I've grown it out, I thought I'd give it another go.

540
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,990
I mean– Why?

541
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,430
- It's my New Year's resolution.
- What kind of resolution is that?

542
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,370
- It's cool.
- It's not cool at all.

543
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,540
- Don't you get sick of always seeing the same face?
- I don't.

544
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,430
I always want to show you something new.

545
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,670
I like new things, but I don't like new things like that.

546
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,420
- Why are you laughing?
- Kim Yumi, after you've been going out with a genius comedian for a year,

547
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,990
- your comebacks have greatly improved.
- Wow.

548
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,030
Yumi, you can't stop me.

549
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,110
I have a house that even a carpenter can't fix.

550
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,890
What? House?

551
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,560
Stubbornness*.
(The second Korean character of stubborn is the same as house)

552
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,070
Another resolution is to make one joke per day. I can check off today!

553
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,710
Aigoo!

554
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,320
What do you want to drink? Hot chocolate?

555
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,730
Yeah, hot chocolate.

556
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,060
I'd like to order.

557
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,660
I'll take your order.

558
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,630
Could I have one hot chocolate?

559
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,240
Happy new year, Assistant Manager Yumi.

560
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,960
Happy new year to you as well, and I hope you accomplish your resolutions this year.

561
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,150
Did you know that the company account already surpassed 5,000 followers?

562
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,320
Wow, really?

563
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,690
It's only been a couple of days.

564
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,220
Really?

565
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,830
It's only been a couple of days. Wow, I'm so glad.

566
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,080
The department head asked to meet with you on Monday.

567
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,150
Department head?

568
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,960
Marketing Team Department Head Seo Yeon Wu.

569
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,810
She wants to meet me? Why?

570
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,800
I don't know.

571
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,560
The interest in it is high, but more importantly, the responses are very positive.

572
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,690
The company's internal reactions are good too.

573
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:32,140
It's a good response if we talk about it at the executive meeting, right?

574
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,300
Ah, yes.

575
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,050
It's all thanks to you, Assistant Manager Kim. I asked many people but I didn't like anything they brought.

576
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,150
I thought about it because Assistant Manager Yu recommended you.

577
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,850
You did a great job.

578
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,870
Ah, no. I also enjoyed it.

579
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,950
I liked Assistant Manager Kim's writing because it was witty.

580
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,490
- Right?
- Yes.

581
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,170
How should I say it? There's a warm feeling to it.

582
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,180
I think it fits well with our noodles.

583
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,050
What's important is the sensibility, not filling stomachs.

584
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,190
Thank you.

585
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,570
I don't really know if I have sensitivity or not.

586
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,980
You do. I told you so.

587
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:20,580
Assistant Manager Kim, so how about moving to the marketing department?

588
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,600
- Pardon?
- If you say yes, I think I can make it happen.

589
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,070
Oh...

590
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,560
Think about it. I highly recommend it.

591
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,230
- I'll get going.
- Goodbye.

592
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,420
You were surprised, right?

593
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,810
What happened?

594
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:54,400
I was surprised too. I guess your post really suits her taste.

595
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,990
Was the department head sincere right now?

596
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,010
Of course. Say you'll do it. What more do you need to think about?

597
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:06,690
Well, I was so flustered. It's something I've never thought about.

598
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,970
The marketing department is the most popular department in our company.

599
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:14,460
So, it's a good thing. I don't think you need to think about it more.

600
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,950
That's right. It's a good thing.

601
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,120
Of course, I must go to the marketing department.

602
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,550
But why am I hesitating?

603
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,690
Financial Statements. The financial statements described in comment 6... It's a good thing. Of course, I must go to the marketing department. But why am I hesitating?

604
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,310
I'm a little scared...

605
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,390
The courage to start anew...

606
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,680
Do I not have courage?

607
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,870
No, we have courage.

608
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:14,750
I had buried a jar of courage here...

609
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,230
It's here!

610
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,790
Okay.

611
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,720
When did you bury this?

612
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,090
It was a while ago. We didn't need courage until now.

613
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:29,090
I think there should still be a lot left.

614
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,340
Really? There are only two bowls left?

615
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,890
Isn't two bowls enough?

616
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,610
I don't think so. Look at this.

617
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:44,960
The amount of courage required for each move is as follows.

618
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,020
Summer, 2019, two years ago

619
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,230
Two bowls to watch a horror movie.

620
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,250
Summer, 2017, 4 years ago

621
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,360
I have to leave now.

622
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,680
Four bowls to drive on the highway

623
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,810
Oh my god!

624
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,090
Five bowls to catch a cockroach

625
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,250
- Eonni.
- Yumi.

626
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,680
Take care.

627
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,940
Don't leave Ruby behind.

628
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,590
What to do...

629
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:43,350
What do you mean? We'll work overtime.

630
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:47,470
It's seven bowls of courage to change departments.

631
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,500
We need seven bowls of courage to change department. What should we do?

632
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,940
Don't worry. If we don't have enough courage, we can borrow some.

633
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,880
- Really?
- Yes.

634
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,700
First, let's borrow some from Section Chief Nam.

635
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,920
Really?

636
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,100
Department Head Seo suggested that you move to her department?

637
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,670
Yes.

638
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,780
You must be really good at writing. I haven't read your posts yet.

639
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,430
I was curious about what you think about it, Section Chief.

640
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,230
You can't. You can't.

641
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,230
You can't hesitate like this.

642
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:27,050
If you like the idea, what's there to hesitate? Isn't it a great opportunity?

643
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,550
- Should I do so?
- Of course!

644
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,910
Everyone else wants to go to the marketing department.

645
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:39,880
That's good. As expected, competent people recognize everything.

646
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,080
Good, let's borrow some from Yi Da too.
Courage +1

647
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,750
What? Really?

648
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:48,090
That's awesome! Really!

649
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,490
Be quiet.

650
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,120
Hey, you got scouted. You've been amazing since the beginning of the year.

651
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,740
You're amazing.

652
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,190
But, I don't even know if I would do well.

653
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,400
What are you talking about? Of course you will.

654
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,660
After all, you weren't the one to request it. It's because they need you there.

655
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,970
You did well.

656
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,360
Of course you did. Courage +1

657
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,510
That's really great.

658
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,490
We already gathered a lot, right?

659
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,810
We only need one more now.

660
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:21,020
- We can get one from Wung.
- Yes.

661
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,370
Courage Courage Courage Courage Courage Courage

662
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,590
You're going to the marketing department?

663
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:46,230
Yes. I was wondering why the department head wanted to see me

664
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,990
and she suddenly made the offer.

665
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,770
- So you're going to go?
- I haven't decided yet.

666
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,250
I just told her I'm going to think about it.

667
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,440
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

668
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,780
Yes, do you think it's a good idea for me to go?

669
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:08,750
I think it's not really a good idea.

670
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:12,840
- What?
- Starting new work is good, but it's something you've never done before.

671
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,080
I think it's better to keep improving on what you're good at now.

672
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,480
6 Bowls of Courage - 1 bowl

673
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:25,250
Of course, but the marketing department is a place everyone wants to get into.

674
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,910
Just because everyone wants to go there doesn't mean it will work out for everybody.

675
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:33,440
If you go, you might end up not doing the work you thought.
Five bowls of courage - 1

676
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,180
That may be.

677
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,010
- But still–
- It's something you're not familiar with.

678
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,820
You said that you were stressed all day writing a few promotional lines for them.

679
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,760
- Right.
- Can you do that every day?

680
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,960
Four bowls of courage - 1

681
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,140
But won't there be some good aspects? It's a department everyone wants.

682
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:00,820
What if you have good expectations and it's different from what you expected? What if it's hard for you to adjust?

683
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:05,390
Do you think I won't be able to adjust well?

684
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,730
Life doesn't go the way you want.

685
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:13,870
I think we should always prepare for the worst.

686
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,950
Three bowls of courage - 3

687
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:27,770
It cracked. What do we do?

688
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:33,190
Prepare? What kind of preparations?

689
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:38,060
Prepare for not even trying? Are you talking about that?

690
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,350
Don't put it sarcastically like that. That's not what I meant.

691
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,560
Let's stop talking about this.

692
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:04,620
What should we eat?

693
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,810
What should we eat?

694
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,950
You're busy. I can eat at home.

695
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:18,020
- You're not going to eat?
- I'm not really hungry and you said you were busy.

696
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,550
We said we would only see each other for a second.

697
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,140
Yumi.

698
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,630
Are you mad?

699
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,210
I'm leaving.

700
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,410
Yumi.

701
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,720
Auntie.

702
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,760
- Do you have spicy tteokbokki?
- Of course, I do.

703
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,780
No, really spicy tteokbokki like super spicy.

704
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,990
Of course.

705
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,760
Yumi's crying! Why is she crying?

706
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,580
Yumi's stressed, so she's eating spicy food.

707
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:44,480
It seems like she's getting more stressed because it's so spicy.

708
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,420
So spicy.

709
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,360
She's purposely adding more stress onto her stress.

710
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,100
Why? Because once her stress reaches its peak...

711
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,510
ENDORPHIN

712
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,960
Guys, Endorphin is here!

713
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,070
♫ I'm so angry, I keep crying ♫

714
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:10,630
♫ I'm so frustrated I feel like going crazy♫

715
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,580
♫ While feeling joy, when you want to bury yourself in♫

716
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,680
♫ the peaks of past pleasures, call me ♫

717
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,300
-Shout!
-Shout!

718
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,770
♫ Leave behind your sad anger ♫

719
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:28,020
♫ Raise your head and look at me. ♫

720
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,240
♫ I'm singing a powerful song in my head ♫

721
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,780
♫ Sing it Oh yeah oh, oh ♫

722
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:40,850
♫ Get rid of your stress.
The only thing that's left is the tension ♫

723
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:44,250
♫ Oh yeah oh, oh ♫

724
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:49,310
♫ The one getting challenged is my past self ♫

725
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,000
Yumi's cells love Endorphin's concerts.

726
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,070
We love you Endorphin!

727
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:10,150
You asked for it spicy but I must've made it too spicy.

728
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:13,420
No, I like that it's spicy.

729
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,690
Even though you're crying?

730
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,240
I like that. It relieves stress.

731
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,480
Everyone, how was that? Is everyone feeling relieved?

732
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:29,150
- Let's promise to always be happy!
- Yes!

733
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:33,850
To the cells who promised me, make a circle over your head!

734
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:38,070
Let's meet again on days Yumi is pissed off!

735
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:42,820
Until now, we are Endorphin!

736
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:47,080
It's been a while since we've had a cool concert.

737
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,090
I wish Yumi gets pissed again.

738
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:56,610
- Thank you for the meal.
- Come again.

739
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,270
Did you get home safely?

740
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,600
Yes, where are you?

741
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,860
I'm home.

742
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,350
Did you eat?

743
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,950
Yes, a little.

744
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,540
I feel better now, I was really down before.

745
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,890
Should we make up with Wung too?

746
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,060
Right now?

747
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:36,110
I think it'll be better to make up with him quickly. Let's not hold on to bad feelings.

748
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,030
Auntie.

749
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:49,750
- Can I have two servings of tteokbooki to go?
- Sure, wait a second.

750
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,030
- With fishcakes and fritters too!
- I'll give you a lot.

751
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:15,800
Why are there so many delivery handouts?

752
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,310
Wait, wait.

753
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:21,340
Isn't it normal for the handouts to fall on the floor when you open the door?

754
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,360
There are too many on there.

755
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,700
Don't you think they put them there after Wung went in?

756
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,280
This many in such a short amount of time?

757
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:53,210
What is this? Did he fall asleep already?

758
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:06,060
Hey, Yumi.

759
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,330
Were you sleeping?

760
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:11,000
No, I'm not sleeping yet.

761
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,860
- Where are you?
- I'm home.

762
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:34,630
Wung, I'm in front of your house right now.

763
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,420
What?

764
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:42,740
You're not home, are you?

765
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,430
Where are you?

766
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,640
Wung. What's going on?

767
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:09,230
♫ Ling Ling don't make a sad face ♫

768
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:16,790
♫ Without my being vigilant in my heart there is no suspicious intent ♫

769
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:21,580
♫ Ling Ling don't try to be understanding ♫

770
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:30,340
♫ Aside from minor quirks I am usually such a person ♫

771
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:46,630
Yumi Cell's
Preview

772
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:50,070
Why do you always keep secrets from me whenever something important happens?

773
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:54,050
Master, the village isn't doing well right now. Something big happened.

774
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,450
Stop what is about to happen to Wung and come.

775
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,850
Well, just because you have a clear goal, it doesn't mean you will be successful.

776
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:04,730
I don't know, but after trying it, I might like it,

777
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,800
and you might have a new goal while trying it.

778
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,280
Of course, there might be difficulties, but I don't want to know them now.

779
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,470
After spending time with him, I realized that Wung is a better person than I thought.

780
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,920
Let's ask Wung if he has thoughts of marriage.

781
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,490
Wung.
