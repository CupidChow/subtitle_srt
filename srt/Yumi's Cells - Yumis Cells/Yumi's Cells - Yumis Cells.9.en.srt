Yumi's Cells

Episode 29
Sae Yi doesn't know...

4
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,060
Episode 29
Sae Yi doesn't know number four

5
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,500
You should at least buy your own wine glasses.

6
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,310
- Yumi.
- We met in the elevator.

7
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,640
She didn't know that I moved.

8
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,700
Thank you for this.

9
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,100
Thank you.

10
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,440
- See you later, Yumi.
- Good bye.

11
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,390
Oh, right.

12
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,710
Yumi, I'm planning a housewarming party. Please come.

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,750
Sure, invite me. I'll come.

14
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,120
Then, have a good time. Good night.

15
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,540
Yumi.

16
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,570
How are you here all of a sudden? You said you were going to bed.

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,990
Come in.

18
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,050
Come in, Yumi.

19
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,960
Come in.

20
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,510
Yumi.

21
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,060
Seo Sae Yi said she moved here.

22
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,280
Ah, that? I guessed she moved in since we were doing a lot of overtime work these days

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,590
and it was hard to commute. I didn't know either.

24
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,040
You didn't know but she comes to borrow a wine glass at this time?

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,620
I found out later.

26
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,280
- When?
- A few days after she moved in.

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,570
She said she moved in last month.

28
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,500
So, you didn't tell me until now? While you knew all along?

29
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,970
I forgot. I guess I forgot.

30
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,790
It's not like Sae Yi moving in is something important.

31
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,440
Come in for now. It's nice to see you all of a sudden.

32
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,630
Don't try to let this pass again. You said you forgot?

33
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,500
Don't talk nonsense.

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,120
Last week, I asked you to meet me at your house and you said you'd meet me outside, right?

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,870
You were afraid that I'd bump into her because she was here. Isn't it? It was like that the week before, too.

36
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,180
I was nearby and said I was going to go up for a bit and you came out instead saying that I didn't need to.

37
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,560
But still, you forgot? You deceived me on purpose!

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,170
- I didn't deceive—
- You did! Why are you lying?

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,140
Because I thought you would be like this.

40
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,800
- What?
- You've always been sensitive when it comes to Sae Yi.

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,350
I didn't say it because it bothered me, too. I was afraid it would come out like this.

42
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:04,420
I never told her to move in here. And, I don't have the right to tell her not to either. That's up to Sae Yi.

43
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,070
I can't kick her out.

44
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,540
I knew you would be sensitive.

45
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,620
Did he just say sensitive? That it was because Yumi is sensitive? This is really...

46
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,510
This is really disgraceful. I can't stand this either!

47
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,720
Let's curse him out. Guys, bring the curse bomb!

48
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,810
No, we have to get him and torture him with facts.

49
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,010
What... torture?

50
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,830
We need Yumi's great encyclopedia.

51
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,570
In a case like this, nothing is left out and recorded.

52
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,710
- Copy it and give it to everyone.
- Understood!

53
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,500
- Just extract the parts about Wung and Sae Yi.
- All right!

54
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,140
It's not because Yumi is sensitive.

55
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,050
- We have to prove it.
- Found it! Sae Yi's strange behavior.

56
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,280
On July the 21th, the yuja syrup incident!

57
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,560
You didn't make it yourself, right?

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,120
Oh, this?

59
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:13,600
- Someone gave it to me.
- Wung lied. And eventually, we confirmed that Sae Yi gave it to him.

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,760
We have some yuja syrup here, too. The one I made.

61
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,760
I found something too! There was also the bombing incident on social media, on August the 6th.

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,060
- That's right! That!
-We're working overtime again. Three Eagles, bravely working.

63
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,710
What the...? Why is she posting this picture on her own account?

64
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,000
It's weird, right?

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,430
Yes, the intention is impure. Why did she post it, even though she knows he has a girlfriend?

66
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,140
- What's her name?
- Seo Sae Yi.

67
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,200
Even her name is strange, the way she's acting is strange. She is strange.

68
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,020
Is there anything else?

69
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,650
Another one! Pretending to know Wung's tastes in everything.

70
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,380
You don't like dongdongju?

71
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,140
- Well, it's not that I don't like it—
- Dongdongju is Wung's favorite.

72
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Wung doesn't really like yubuchobap. He's more of a kimbap guy.

73
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,600
I think Yumi's birthday was the cherry on the cake.

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,250
That necklace. We picked it out together.

75
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,980
He said it was your birthday. He kept picking weird things, so I picked that for him.

76
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,710
It looks good on you.

77
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,520
The yuja syrup. You lied about that at first.

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,970
And also made a quick excuse.

79
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,280
What about Seo Sae Yi?

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,210
Whenever I see her, she pretends to know all your tastes and tell me about them every time.

81
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,530
She posted a couple picture on her social media without any permission,

82
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,660
and just as if it wasn't enough to pretend to be your girlfriend now...

83
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,440
she even moved downstairs.

84
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,070
She comes to your home at this time under the pretext of borrowing things.

85
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,540
And it doesn't look like it's the first time you two exchanged things.

86
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,790
You said that I am sensitive? No.

87
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,800
This is absurd, Wung.

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,100
Anyone will say it's strange, if you ask them.

89
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,440
Don't you think so?

90
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,850
About that...

91
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,460
She has always been like that.

92
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,040
- She has always been like that?
- There's nothing I can do about it. Her personality is normally like that. Doing whatever she wants.

93
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,320
- That's why—
- I'm supposed to move on because she's that kind of person?

94
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,940
Because she's your friend? Because she has always been like that?

95
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,810
That's not right.

96
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,670
You have a girlfriend now. You have me!

97
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,890
It's different from before!

98
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,720
Then you have to cut it off. You could have cut it off.

99
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,410
But you didn't and kept lying to me.

100
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,180
Yumi...

101
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,170
Emergency. Emergency. Yumi is burning with anger.

102
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,820
I've never seen Yumi this angry. What should we do?

103
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,730
But what did Wung do so wrong?

104
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,890
- What?
- We've been doing our best.

105
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,910
Whenever it got difficult, we turned into Bear mode every time.

106
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,390
You should have told me earlier

107
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,580
We did everything.

108
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,170
We even tried to stop her from moving here.

109
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,930
Ah, Wung. I've been visiting homes when you were on vacation.

110
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,950
Homes? You're going to move?
- Yes.

111
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,650
The taxi fare is getting too high, I can't keep doing it.

112
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,220
- It's better to move near the office.
- That's more convenient.

113
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,240
The officetel where you're living is nice. The location too.

114
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,220
- Where I'm currently living?
- Yes.

115
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,950
It was the best place nearby.

116
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,910
It's too expensive there.
It's all overpriced.
It's facing north, so there is little sunlight.

117
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,280
The water pressure is too weak. The poop won't go down.

118
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,940
Poop, unclog, poop, unclog. Do you want to live like this? You can't.

119
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,140
You're saying your toilet's water pressure is weak? At your place?

120
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,030
It's not. His toilet flush is like a waterfall, really.

121
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,690
This place's water pressure is great.

122
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,460
But what can we do about her moving however she wants?

123
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,360
That's right. We've never been distracted in front of Sae Yi. This is a bit unfair.

124
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,270
Let's explain this well to Yumi so that she understands.

125
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,420
Let's run the algorithm!

126
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,170
Wung's algorithm is running starting from now, .

127
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,460
Yumi, first let's sit down and hear me out—

128
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,990
Sae Yi is actually acting like your girlfriend pretending to be your friend.

129
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,680
But why are you accepting it all?

130
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,210
- I've never accept—
- You are right now!

131
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:49,270
You said I have a sensitive personality, right? That's not it. You're the one who isn't careful.

132
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,810
Neither Sae Yi nor you are careful,

133
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,760
and you don't have the least consideration toward me.

134
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,540
Next step, relieving Yumi's ang—

135
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,120
Yumi's ang— Yumi's ang—

136
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,960
Yumi's—
What's going on? What's happening?

137
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,520
Look at that!

138
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,450
- What is this?
- This can't be!

139
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,210
What's going on?

140
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,640
We're in trouble. The Ice Gu Wung state has been activated!

141
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,400
When Wung gets angry, everything freezes!

142
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,050
Am I wrong?

143
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,550
I was taking care of it in a way that wouldn't make everyone uncomfortable.

144
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,080
Does keeping it a secret from me take care of it?

145
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,930
Sae Yi is just a friend to me.

146
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,290
Isn't that all that matters?

147
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,030
That's not my point right now.

148
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,300
Why do I have to explain every single time? That's she's just a friend.

149
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,020
What is that? Is he getting mad right now?

150
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,930
Isn't he the one who did something wrong? He should be begging on his knees!

151
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,420
How dare he be mad at us?

152
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,620
Shouldn't you be apologizing rather than explaining?

153
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,040
I have nothing to apologize for.

154
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,450
You have nothing to apologize for?

155
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,220
I don't.

156
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,610
I'm so mad at you.

157
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,140
But you have nothing to apologize for?

158
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,410
Fine, I got it.

159
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,070
I'll leave.

160
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,080
♫ I want to smile for you ♫

161
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,190
Wait! Is it right to leave?

162
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,900
We didn't solve anything.

163
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,980
♫ If you meet my eyes first ♫

164
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,920
Yumi left. She just left!

165
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,240
No! Stop her!

166
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,690
Like an awkward confession

167
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:21,390
♫ I want to be comforted ♫

168
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,320
Is he stopping her? No way. He is, right?

169
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,390
No. Yumi left. We should do something!

170
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,230
This is not right. Every function is frozen!

171
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,730
♫ I want to smile for you ♫

172
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,470
♫ I want our eyes to meet again ♫

173
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,250
♫ Today again, after a long time ♫

174
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,350
Stop her. Please!

175
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,740
♫ It finally returned ♫

176
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,580
♫ Finally it returned. ♫

177
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,670
♫ I want to hang onto you ♫

178
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,740
♫ Before we get further apart ♫

179
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,770
♫ On top of my pillow ♫

180
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:17,820
♫ our beautiful times ♫

181
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,210
♫ keep falling. ♫

182
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,260
How can he do this?

183
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,060
How can Wung do this?

184
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,920
I thought he'd hold onto us and apologize.

185
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,390
I've never seen him so cold. I was a little scared.

186
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,280
He'll probably call, right? If he does, let's forgive him for now.

187
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,490
And we can make him promise not to let this ever happen again.

188
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,240
Yes, let's do that.

189
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,480
Missed call - Mom

190
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,620
Hello? Mom, you called.

191
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,560
Yes, I'm on my way back.

192
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,540
What's up?

193
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,930
He's not even calling. Isn't he even worried if she made it home safely?

194
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:10,950
He'll at least text, right? No way he wouldn't.

195
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,410
Wake up!

196
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,790
Wake up!

197
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,340
Wake up!

198
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,940
Wake up!

199
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,680
Until this morning, there was no text or call.

200
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,120
This has happened for the first time ever since we started dating Wung.

201
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,960
Therefore, I think everyone should acknowledge this is a very serious situation.

202
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,770
Then I'll set the breakup alarm as of 11 o'clock last night.

203
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,220
- Breakup alarm?
- What's that?

204
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,890
It's a new machine. Breakup alarm.

205
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,490
Usage manual.

206
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,290
If there is no contact for 24 hours after the fight, it will be considered a breakup.

207
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,020
Hold on! 24 hours is too short! Can we make it 36 hours?

208
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,850
She's right. When you date, it's possible to fight.

209
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,990
How about we make it 48 hours so it's easy to calculate?

210
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,670
Yeah, let's make it 48 hours.

211
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,560
48 hours is good.

212
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,260
- We can't.
- Why not?

213
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,560
We can only set it up to 24 hours by default.

214
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,560
Since we left Wung's place at 11:11pm last night...

215
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,940
- Eonni.
- Yes?
- I've made the report.

216
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,560
- Thank you.
- Please check it over.

217
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,520
All right.

218
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,410
- Yumi, good morning.
- Good morning.

219
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,130
Yeah.

220
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,560
- Hello.
- Good morning.

221
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,490
If, until 11:11 tonight,

222
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,620
we don't hear from Wung, this relationship is over.

223
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,260
- Good morning.
- Hey.

224
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,630
You're all early. You must be tired.

225
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,630
Hey, you call 11 early?

226
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,100
What's this? Coffee?

227
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,090
Yes, I got some coffee.

228
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,890
Ice latte for you, right?

229
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,370
Wow, I'm so thankful. I was feeling lazy to go out to get some milk—

230
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,600
I knew it. You're the best.

231
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,500
Iced Americano for Wung.

232
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,170
Wung, have some coffee.

233
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,090
- Are you all right?
- What do you mean?

234
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,860
I mean ... I was just worried.

235
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,420
We ran into each other at the apartment yesterday and Yumi seemed flustered.

236
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,400
I didn't know you didn't tell her.

237
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,900
- Is it still not working?
- It's totally messed up. Nothing works.

238
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,230
- What's that?
- Huh?

239
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,840
What is that? I didn't press that.

240
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,440
I know about Wung very well.

241
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,030
Isn't that Sae Yi's voice?

242
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,270
I know Wung very well. So from now on, I will take him over.

243
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,460
- It's a virus!
- What?

244
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,200
A Sae Yi Virus infiltrated through the broken circuits!

245
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,670
Should I tell you what kind of a person Wung is?

246
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,770
You didn't have a fight with Yumi by chance, right?

247
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,840
Omo! Did you really fight?

248
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,560
Number one, Gu Wung can't hide his feelings.

249
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,880
W-where's my coffee?

250
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,530
I put it over there.

251
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,440
Coffee's the best after a good poop.

252
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,510
Enjoy.

253
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,230
So his face shows all the information.

254
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,740
I should have made a stronger password for the gate of his heart, like Yumi.

255
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,110
The security system must have been too lax.

256
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,460
And for Wung, himself is always his top priority.

257
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,610
Top 10 priorities: #3 Mother
#2 Yumi
#1 Gu Wung

258
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:01,180
Then whose side would he take if #1 and #2 fights?

259
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,430
Yes, Seonbae.

260
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,640
Yes, yes. Pardon?

261
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,510
Just a moment.

262
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,990
Now, should we make #1 push #2 out?

263
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,590
I don't want to get involved in people's dating lives, and I'm careful before saying anything.

264
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,070
I don't really know your situation as a couple,

265
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,980
so it's not easy to say, but I don't want you to be too stressed.

266
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,120
I'm worried that you're not happy dating, that you're just getting stressed out.

267
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,190
No matter what anyone says, the most important is yourself.

268
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,730
Don't you think?

269
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,140
You're right. I think so, too.

270
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,370
You get close because you can understand.

271
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,440
But I don't think you should be understanding and condone everything just because you're close with that person.

272
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,820
No, no. Wung, get back to your senses! You shouldn't be fooled by a virus!

273
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,470
You're right. If you don't match with someone, trying to force it to work out is only going to give you stress.

274
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,380
No matter how good it is or how much you've grown attached,

275
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,350
when people don't fit each other, you'll forever not fit each other.

276
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,300
I think so, too.

277
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,920
So you aren't going to make up with Miss Yumi?

278
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,590
- What do you mean?
- Hmm?

279
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,540
I'm talking about you right now.

280
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,240
Your actions make me uncomfortable.

281
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,030
I think there is a limit to me understanding everything because you're close.

282
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,750
Your actions are stressing me out right now.

283
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,890
My actions? What did I do?

284
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,810
Is it because I moved to your apartment building?

285
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,150
You guys fought because of that and now you're taking it out on me?

286
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,770
I can't believe it. I mean what am I supposed to do when work is close by?

287
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,330
Do I have to consider those type of things between friends?

288
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,220
Is that really your point of view?

289
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,290
And not Yumi's point of view?

290
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,830
Are you talking as my friend or Yumi's boyfriend?

291
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,570
Gu Wung, aren't we friends?

292
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,400
Longer than your dating relationship at least?

293
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,320
Number three, word 'friend' is a weak spot for Gu Wung.

294
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,780
Argh! This won't do.

295
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,130
I haven't changed a bit. It's you who's changed.

296
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,350
I'm the one that should be hurt.

297
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,160
You did change ever since you started dating Yumi.

298
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,540
People tend to get similar when they date for a long time and I'm worried that might happen to you, too.

299
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,050
Like someone. All twisted.

300
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,740
Transmitting to all cells! #2 is being attacked currently!

301
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,480
All Wung's cells, wake up!

302
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,280
Sae Yi knows Wung very well, but she doesn't know the fourth principle, yet.

303
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
I 💝Yumi

304
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,800
When you look with a twisted view, even friendship can look weird.

305
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,760
Hey, Seo Sae Yi.

306
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,390
Watch what you say.

307
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,950
Episode 25 : Hidden Card

308
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,780
Daehan Noodles

309
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,010
Eonni, summary of Dongseo Corporation.

310
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,350
Eonni, are you not feeling well?

311
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,060
No.

312
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,090
Yumi, cheer up.

313
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,160
It's only five o'clock.

314
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,180
But a great flood started.

315
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,060
No, not yet!

316
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,420
Yumi, it's not 11 yet.

317
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,130
Why are you like this already?

318
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,530
No!

319
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,550
Just like one human can't stop natural disasters,

320
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:14,460
one cell cannot stop the emotions rushing in.

321
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,600
In the end, the flood engulfed the village.

322
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,680
Wung never contacted me.

323
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,970
Not even once.

324
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,020
- Good morning!
- Hello.
[That winter]

325
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,280
- Yumi, good morning.
- Good morning.

326
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:58,570
I thought he'd send me at least one text after a while.
[Next Summer]

327
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,880
But he didn't.

328
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,570
- Hey!
- Where do you get these things from anyway?

329
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,900
I didn't contact him either.

330
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,990
Since it wasn't my fault, back then,

331
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,470
I thought I shouldn't be the one contacting him first.

332
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,620
Winter again

333
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,760
One day after four years, this suddenly came to my mind.

334
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,240
What if something happened to Wung that day?

335
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:42,240
I searched for his blog or social media, just in case.

336
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,000
And I ended up finding it.

337
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,230
How was he doing?

338
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,520
He was doing well.

339
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,660
Five years later.

340
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,570
The end. I talked too much about me.

341
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:12,460
Awesome. I didn't know you had such a love story!

342
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,940
It's just a common story.

343
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,660
But don't you think things would've been different if you had called first back then?

344
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,360
Do you think so?

345
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,010
If you were to go back to then, do you think you'd contact him?

346
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,610
Probably?

347
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,150
Section Chief!

348
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:35,200
Then I will time warp you to five years ago, so you should go contact him.

349
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,490
Goodness. Did you just wake up?

350
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,660
It's so sad. Why did they break up?

351
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,200
Sure, thanks for the thought.

352
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,340
You should time travel and ask him to date you again.

353
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,240
What?

354
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,130
What was that just now?

355
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,780
That skill was 'You're writing a scenario'!

356
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,010
- Huh?
- How did that happen?

357
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,850
That's Writer's skill.

358
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,790
Writer is dead.

359
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,300
I resurrected her!

360
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,410
It's been a while since I wrote a scenario.

361
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,780
Good job, Writer.

362
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,450
Thanks for resurrecting me.

363
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,630
I'm the one who should be thankful. Thanks to your scenario, cells' minds were changed.

364
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,420
When you imagine the future, you can know what conclusion to form in the present.

365
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,460
What Yumi really wants becomes clear.

366
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,210
Yumi's cells, everyone assemble!

367
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,580
Yumi's rules come before dating rules!

368
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,380
Let's go to Gu Wung.

369
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,970
Yes!

370
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,500
I'm late. I'll get going.

371
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,260
See you tomorrow.

372
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,350
Wung.

373
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,640
Earlier in the morning, I think said something I shouldn't have.

374
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,310
It wasn't to make you mad but it seems like you're being misunderstood.

375
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,320
It made me upset, so I just said it without knowing.

376
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,030
I'm sorry.

377
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,170
It's fine. Let's not talk about it anymore.

378
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,680
No, I really think what I said earlier was a mistake.

379
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,850
I'm sorry. I'll be careful from now on.

380
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,410
I think I was a bit harsh too. Forget about it.

381
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,340
No, no. You said what you had to.

382
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,340
You want to eat pajeon before you go? I'm hungry.

383
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,750
Let's eat next time.

384
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,110
You're leaving now?

385
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,130
Yeah, I think I need to leave early today.

386
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,960
No, if he's leaving now that means he's going to Yumi.

387
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,850
Then it's back to square one.

388
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,980
We can't go back to square one.

389
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,950
I'm leaving first. I'll see you tomorrow.

390
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,420
Wung.

391
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,160
What?

392
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,500
Wung, we used to have a very special relationship.

393
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,980
If I get married it'll be Gu Wung, right?

394
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,010
If I get married, it's going to be Gu Wung.

395
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,430
I have something to say, Wung.

396
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,480
I—

397
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,240
I thought you were friends.

398
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,790
- Yumi, how—
- Wait.

399
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,430
I need to talk to Sae Yi first.

400
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,570
You said you were friends, so what are you doing right now?

401
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,530
- You said you were just friends.
- Yes.

402
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,580
But, Yumi, according to you, friends can't even hold hands—

403
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,930
No, they can't.

404
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,550
- Then I—
- Yes, don't.

405
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,030
- What did I—
- Don't do anything.

406
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,250
- Well, you—
- No, I don't understand, so don't do it.

407
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,840
Wait!

408
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,610
You won't even let me get a word in.

409
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,610
- What did I even do that you keep telling me I can't–
- All your actions up until this point.

410
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,820
Don't do those things again from now on.

411
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,410
My actions? What did I do?

412
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,950
I don't have any idea what you're saying right now. I don't.

413
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,850
- Don't you know?
- No, I don't.

414
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,590
- Stop it.
- There's no way you don't know.

415
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,700
No, I really don't know at all.

416
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,600
Your Respectful Honor, since she keeps insisting she doesn't know, let's make sure she knows.

417
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,170
Listen up, Seo Sae Yi, as of now I'm going to make my judgment.

418
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,100
I heard you have a cold. Make this at home for breakfast and dinner.

419
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,560
Gifting yuja tea syrup and writing a memo that could confuse a guy.

420
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,490
Violation of the Prevention Act on Love for improper solicitation.

421
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,770
Violation
Get well soon, Wung

422
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,480
Intentionally posting on social media pretending to be a couple.

423
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,130
Violation of the Law on Insinuating Relationships on social media.

424
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,660
Taking a piece of thread off his shoulders.

425
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,000
Infringement of ownership regarding one's boyfriend's thread and eye booger.

426
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,880
Dongdongju is Wung's favorite.

427
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,890
Violation of the Act on trying to prove that she knows more about Wung,

428
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,060
And the Act on the Protection of My Man's Personal Information.

429
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,660
Moving to Wung's officetel.

430
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,690
What?

431
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,480
Going to Wung's house frequently,

432
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,010
Violation of the Special Law on Access Restricted Zones.

433
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,320
Acknowledging all these crimes, I have made a judgment.

434
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,540
Yumi is innocent, Seo Sae Yi is guilty!

435
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,870
Therefore, Seo Sae Yi can get lost!

436
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,850
Geez.
[I love Yumi]

437
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:41,200
Now do you understand why your actions are wrong?

438
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,430
If you were Wung's friend, you shouldn't put him in difficult situations as a friend.

439
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,710
If you sincerely cherished him as a friend. Isn't that so?

440
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,950
That's what I would do.

441
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,280
- If you were really my friend.
Yumi, that's enough.

442
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,510
Put yourself in my shoes and think about it.

443
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,450
- Think about how the other person would feel.
- Yumi.

444
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,030
- Would you be happy if you were in my shoes?
- Yumi!

445
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,730
That's enough.

446
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,070
Stop it already.

447
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,330
Yumi.

448
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,660
Yumi come to your senses!

449
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,370
What's wrong? Guys!

450
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,080
Judge! Your judgment was counterproductive.

451
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,850
Yumi can't say anything!

452
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,100
It's because Yumi can only choose to lose now.

453
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,000
What?

454
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,960
Yumi doesn't intend on breaking up with Wung at all.

455
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,670
If she doesn't have any intention of breaking up, then it doesn't matter how much they fight,

456
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,970
ultimately, she'll have no choice but to give in.

457
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,170
Show me the card you have.

458
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,090
Surrendering
surrender no matter what

459
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,100
The remaining card is Surrender isn't it?

460
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,920
- Yes.
- Here.

461
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,870
Throw that card away and take this.

462
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,950
This is-

463
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:42,010
The Breakup card. It's a card that should always be kept with you when you're in a relationship.

464
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,890
We've never had this before.

465
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,710
Without this, Yumi can't do what she wants.

466
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,460
From now on, Yumi will use the Breakup card.

467
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,690
Breakup
'Let's break up'

468
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,670
Just by obtaining the Breakup card,

469
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,960
Yumi will be able to do whatever she wants now.

470
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,360
Yumi's Priorities: First Place Gu Wung
Second Place Yumi
Third Place Mom

471
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,130
First Place Yumi (1△)
Second Place Gu Wung (1 ▽)

472
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,390
Yumi, are you listening?

473
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,880
Wung.

474
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:37,810
No matter what you think of me, I have to say this.

475
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:44,620
You may not see it in your eyes but the way I see it, that person

476
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,330
is not a good colleague or friend who's worth defending.

477
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,470
Don't keep someone like that by your side, Wung.

478
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,690
You're a good person.

479
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,620
Yumi.

480
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,800
Wung, every time you find someone you care about,

481
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,070
your friend will act out again as she is now.

482
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,640
Whoever you meet, that is.

483
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,110
I'm leaving.

484
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,410
I don't have the power to push aside Seo Sae Yi.

485
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,800
I also can't control Wung the way I want.

486
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,890
But it's my choice to not see him if I don't want to, or to keep seeing him if I want to.

487
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,010
Of course, that would be the same for Wung.

488
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,730
New post

489
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:20,030
Episode 26
Aigoo.

490
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,220
Today I'm going to introduce what I do in a day.

491
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,320
Wake up!

492
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,800
So noisy! The alarm sound!

493
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,790
Wake up!

494
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,930
Gosh!

495
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,560
Why am I the only one who hears that noise?

496
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,770
Wake up!

497
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,030
♫ With only dust flying under the light bulb ♫

498
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,030
Wake up!

499
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,190
Wake up!

500
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,910
Wake up!

501
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,770
My busy day starts with Yumi turning off the alarm.

502
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,660
♫ When rain pours ♫

503
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,990
♫ without respite. Once more ♫

504
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,800
In the morning, there's a lot to do.

505
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,190
Hey, wake up! Guys, wake up!

506
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,250
We have to go to work.

507
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,030
Hey! What do you think you're doing, you crazy jerk!

508
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,070
So cold!

509
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,350
Good morning!

510
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:19,810
It's also my job to wake up Fashion cell and Face Wash cell.

511
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,290
♫ A holiday where through the leaves there is a small boat. ♫

512
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,230
What should I wear?

513
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,050
I wore this yesterday.

514
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,000
I wore that all last week.

515
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,480
There's nothing to wear. Nothing. Kim Yumi needs to buy clothes.

516
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,260
How on earth am I supposed to—

517
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,890
Choose quickly! We don't have time!

518
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,730
Let's just wear that.

519
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,840
- Good morning!
- Yi Da, good morning!

520
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,850
What's this?

521
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,520
Thank you!

522
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,210
When Yumi comes to work, I usually roll the millstone.

523
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:04,210
Maybe it's because the weather's nice but there are no cells helping out today.

524
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,200
The weather's so nice today.

525
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,470
You're supposed to go on picnics on days like this, right?

526
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,500
Right.

527
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,620
The only one who helps me is Stingy cell.

528
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,860
Thanks, Stingy.

529
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,680
I want to make Yumi rich.

530
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,200
Huh?

531
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,250
You're going to make her rich by saving her salary?

532
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:42,000
Yes!

533
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,370
Fortunately, there is also a break time.

534
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:49,230
Hi guys! What should we eat for lunch?

535
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:53,480
♫ the more the night slips away ♫

536
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,500
So good. It tastes so good.

537
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,410
Eonni, look at the part time worker.

538
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:04,800
It's him, the flower boy*.
(Refers to handsome men)

539
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,030
It's so good, isn't it?

540
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:11,640
From 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. we get to rest thanks to Hunger.

541
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,120
I'm so happy.

542
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,790
Eonni, what happened?

543
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:19,500
- What?
- You fought with your boyfriend last week.

544
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,390
♫It's a holiday where through the leaves there was a small boat and me.  ♫

545
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,290
What? She's asking a sensitive question again.

546
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,350
Wait! I'll answer that!

547
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,410
I also have to go during important conversations.

548
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,600
What do you mean fight? Who?

549
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,800
It was so obvious. What happened? Did you two make up?

550
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,160
No.

551
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,350
- Your coffee is ready.
- What? You broke up?

552
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,070
What are you two talking about?

553
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:27,380
Nope. We didn't fight.

554
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,310
What's she saying?

555
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,540
They must have made up.

556
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,910
Let's raise it a little to the right.

557
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,320
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,560
That's good, that's good.

559
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,860
-Good?
-Yeah.

560
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:50,620
Remembering the important memories in Yumi's life is a part of my job.

561
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,760
It's so beautiful.

562
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,380
As the sun sets, Sensitivity wakes up from her sleep.

563
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,620
Someday I will go to Africa.

564
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,140
Africa!

565
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:23,520
We'll run through the grasslands with a herd of buffalo and greet the magnificent sunset, right?

566
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,160
When Sensitivity wakes up, we can consider the millstone work for the day is over.

567
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,870
Goodbye.

568
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:31,740
Goodbye!

Should I come get you?

572
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:45,370
I try my best to stay out of dating-related issues.

How about we respond like this? I was thinking...

575
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,990
Because that is Love's job.

576
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,580
Love, can you add a P.S.?

577
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,520
What?

578
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,920
Wung, do you know what underwear I wore today?

579
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,500
Hey Naughty! Stop it right there!

580
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,400
But because of Naughty, I can't fully rest.

581
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,560

Since Yumi's writer cell was revived, she started to write again.

596
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,880
Writer, it's not "I go"

597
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,080
it's "I'll go"
(spelling error)

"I'll go"

599
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,390
It's not that "personality was wrong", but it'd be better to say "personality changed"

600
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,250
Just something to note. Work hard!

Hey Louis. Coffee.

What are you so worried about?

624
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,600
Deciding to do it ourselves without Sae Yi, there is no end to this. No end.

625
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,230
I mean, we haven't been able to go home for days. What is this?

626
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,920
Sae Yi worked so fast. I didn't know her absence would feel this big.

627
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,870
We've put an announcement, so I'm sure we'll get contacted soon.

628
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,540
I talked to Sae Yi earlier,

629
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,410
she decided to go into the company that scouted her.

630
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,710
She seemed to be really angry at you.

631
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,670
- Really?
- So why did you two fight so much?

632
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,170
It's only been a day or two since you two fought.

633
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,450
Are you not going to see her ever again? Not even once?

634
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:52,440
Wung, we all worked together for so long. You don't feel sad at all?

635
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,290
I'm not sure.

636
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,260
What do you mean you're not sure?

637
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,470
I don't really know.

638
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,890
Wung's sky isn't in the book?

639
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,470
Let's see. Regular sky is yellow, that's not it.

640
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,380
Isn't it the sad sky?

641
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,880
No no, look at it carefully. The color is different.

642
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,420
It's not the sad sky.

643
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,300
That's true.
 Illustrated Book of Wung's Skies

644
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,910
Oh wait! Could that be a mix of moods?

645
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,360
Look! When he's sorry, it's green. When he's mad, its a red sky.

646
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,200
When he is feeling regret, it's purple.

647
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,340
If you add all of those colors, it becomes this poop color!

648
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,720
So he's sorry, mad, and regretful?

649
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,430
Wow. This is not good.

650
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:40,280
I feel sorry because it's my fault,

651
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,840
and feel mad about why she ended it this way,

652
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,370
and feel regretful because Sae Yi isn't here anymore. I guess it's like that.

653
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,360
Couldn't you meet her and make up?

654
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,530
No. I don't think that's right.

655
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,270
- Why?
- It's something that was brewing for some time.

656
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,890
It was bound to happen some day.

657
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,170
I'll tell you honestly.

658
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,880
It's not that I didn't know.

659
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,930
I was just pretending not to know.

660
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:07,630
What?

661
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,690
How you felt about me all this time.

662
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:19,930
Too precious to give to anyone else, but too much to have for yourself. That's how you've been feeling.

663
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,980
I've known this, all along.

664
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,980
- Wung ...
- I pretended not to know,

665
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:32,450
because it wasn't that important to me. But I don't think I can do that anymore.

666
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,450
Don't think of me as your backup, Sae Yi.

667
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:39,670
There is no chance at all of that happening.

668
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:47,390
You have to promise me that ... So that I can be able to work with you again.

669
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:55,840
Hey. Gu Wung. You think you can make whatever judgments you want,

670
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:01,410
come to whatever conclusions you want, and reject me however you want?

671
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,630
- I can't believe this.
- I'm not the same Gu Wung from college, Sae Yi.

672
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,930
Someone who did whatever you wanted because he was immature.

673
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,980
So?

674
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,310
- What?
- Are you going to marry Kim Yumi?

675
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,610
You made a promise to each other, huh?

676
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,630
It hasn't been that long since you two started dating.

677
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:22,660
And me? It's been over ten years for us.

678
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,250
It's been over ten years. With the same goals, until now.

679
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,550
Sae Yi, this has nothing to do with Yumi.

680
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,260
This is about the relationship between you and me.

681
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:39,370
Whether we are even truly friends. Or if we mistakenly ended up here.

682
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,470
I'm sure she'll do well. She's really talented.

683
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,300
I really don't know.

684
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,430
Everything will be fine over time. Let's get to work, okay?

685
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,450
It's ... it's not okay.

686
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:15,070
Snow. It's going to be hard when I get off work.

687
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,650
Assistant Manager Yumi.

688
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,040
Kim Yumi!

689
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,470
Here.

690
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,170
Take a coffee with you.

691
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,330
All right.

692
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:44,450
But, did you call me Kim Yumi just now?

693
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,590
I'm sorry, it seemed like you didn't hear me when I called.

694
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,670
What would you like?

695
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,980
Then, a hot latte...

696
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,610
One hot latte please.

697
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,260
Thank you.

698
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,310
You don't seem to be working out these days.

699
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:05,190
I stopped working out after the race.

700
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,540
The race is over already?

701
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,670
Yes, two weeks ago.

702
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,060
Which place did you get?

703
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,140
What matters is that I participated.

704
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,390
Yes.

705
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,020
I'll guess on my own.

706
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,030
Your latte is ready.

707
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,150
Thank you.

708
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,660
Here.

709
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,580
Thank you.

710
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,540
Isn't the snow ...

711
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,440
- so nice?
- It makes me worried about getting home.

712
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,100
I'm sorry.

713
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,380
I am not romantic.

714
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,160
I don't really like winter to begin with.

715
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,720
It's cold, and it snows.

716
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,760
- Even Christmas?
- Christmas?

717
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,320
What are you doing for Christmas?

718
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,580
I'm not sure.

719
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,640
I don't think I'll know until then, because my boyfriend is busy.

720
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,920
Me too. Making plans is meaningless because of my girlfriend's schedule.

721
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,230
Oh, by the way, I made the tartar sauce you taught me back then.

722
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,730
Really?

723
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:15,100
It's different from buying one, it tasted better.

724
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,620
Right? I developed that.

725
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,040
I'm good with sauces.

726
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,920
They say when you are good at making sauces, you are a master of cooking.

727
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,890
I'm not, I just have some interest.

728
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,640
I like looking for good restaurants.

729
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,140
You can go ahead, I have to buy something first.

730
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,860
Yes.

731
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,760
- Ah, right.
- Yes?

732
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,440
I wanted to ask you something...

733
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,830
What is it?

734
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,640
I'll ask you later.

735
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,990
Yumi!

736
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:58,710
Wung!

737
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,760
Did you wait for long?

738
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,920
No, but it's really cold now.

739
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,500
My hands are freezing.

740
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,300
Your hands are freezing?

741
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,460
If your hands are freezing...

742
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,790
Hey, I'm fine. There are so many people, what are you doing?

743
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,760
Docking right hand, left hand.

744
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,440
Success.

745
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,040
Now, there's no way for the warmth to escape.

746
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,640
It's the best.

747
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,180
Let's go.

748
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,790
Tell me if your feet are cold, I'll do your feet too.

749
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:43,210
How would you do the feet?

750
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,130
Wung, you can have all this.

751
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,260
I am full.

752
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,800
But, today you...

753
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,420
What?

754
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,700
There's no way.

755
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,000
What? What?

756
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,790
You're pretty.

757
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,840
You scared me.

758
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,850
Make that compliment more ticklish*.
(In a more obvious or embarrassing manner)

759
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,020
- Ticklish?
- Yes.

760
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,980
Pretty.

761
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,790
Not this kind of tickling.

762
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,700
Pretty.

763
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,110
That tickles!

764
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,920
So noisy!

765
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,510
Look. It's starting now.

766
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,970
How was the movie?

767
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:01,060
It was fun, why are the reviews so bad?

768
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,580
I liked it too. If you have finished drinking, give it to me.

769
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,810
No.

770
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,060
I'll throw it for you, give it to me.

771
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,550
No it's okay, there is still some left.

772
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:13,640
There is? Then give me some.

773
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,360
I've been wanting to try the milk tea.

774
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,290
Wow.

775
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,140
Thank you.

776
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,390
Is it good?

777
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,060
It's really good. This is how it should taste.

778
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,440
Let's go.

779
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,690
You should have told me earlier.

780
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,820
Ah, I guess I like milk tea.

781
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:42,100
After the end of the year, Wung and I will have been dating for two years.

782
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:48,080
At this point, the excitement decreased, but there was something else instead.

783
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,550
We have to wait at least ten minutes.

784
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,840
Shall we sit down a bit?
 Bus Route Map

785
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,480
Wait.

786
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,620
I'm good. You don't have to do all that.

787
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,270
You also sit.

788
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:10,330
Wow.

789
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:15,730
It's hard to explain exactly what that is.

790
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,690
I said sit.

791
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:26,720
♫ What's changed is the person I love. ♫

792
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,930
But at that moment, you say "Aigoo."

793
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,190
Are you having fun?

794
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,850
Yes, today was also fun.

795
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,440
If you're having fun, then I'm having fun too.

796
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,890
Is that so?

802
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,860
Yes, Wung. Did you get home?

803
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,700
No, I haven't slept yet.

804
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,110
I was writing.

805
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:19,740
Our story.

806
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,180
There's something like that.

807
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,240
You can see later. It's embarrassing.

808
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,840
But, what took you so long to get home?

809
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,620
It's snowing?

810
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,600
It's snowing a lot.

811
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,980
How do I go to work tomorrow?

812
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,770
But it's still pretty.

813
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:53,210
It really feels like winter.

814
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:01,130
When it snows like this, you have to build a snowman or have a snowball fight.

815
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,230
I did that a lot when I was a kid.

You saw my post?

826
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:54,530
Yes, I stumbled across it through an employee's account.

827
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,520
How should I put this? It's hard to explain but they seem just like you.

828
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,210
What do you mean by just like me?

829
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,860
Think about it carefully, I highly recommend it

830
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,820
The department head suddenly suggested it. What do you think?

831
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,560
- 30 minutes?
- It will take me thirty minutes because I'm putting effort into it.

832
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,310
Usually it wouldn't take more than ten minutes.

833
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,430
I see.

834
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:19,350
You said it just has to be to three or four lines. I'll try it. I think I can do it.

835
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:22,620
I can't even write three or four lines? That doesn't make sense.

836
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,540
It's only three or four lines.

837
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,680
I must be crazy.

838
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,160
♫ When that happens will you say to me "you did well" and "good job"? ♫
