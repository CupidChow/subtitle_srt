Going on a trip
Episode 15
At Yumi's home

4
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,980
Hello everyone in Wung's village. Did everybody sleep well?

5
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,720
It's a morning that reminds me of this kind of phrase.

6
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,580
Happiness always comes with trials.

7
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,390
It was like that yesterday.

8
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,030
But did you have to pick out the necklace with Sae Yi?

9
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,950
Why couldn't you tell me that Sae Yi was the one who gave you the yuja syrup?

10
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,710
I'm hanging up. Enjoy the dongdongju. Goodnight.

11
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,560
Wait... Hello? Hello?

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,980
♫ Except for my being vigilant in my heart there is no suspicious intent ♫

13
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,400
It was our first time seeing Yumi angry.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,600
♫ Ling Ling Don't try to be understanding ♫

15
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,570
♫ Aside from minor quirks I am usually such a person ♫

16
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,600
Please give me that one.

17
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,730
We were afraid that Yumi's birthday would be the last day we saw her.

18
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,790
It also took courage to go find her at her place. But...

19
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,550
♫ Even if you are looking for something new, ♫

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,530
♫ I'll keep remembering the past, ♫

21
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,200
♫ We're going to fall. ♫

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,840
- It's Yumi.
- What do we do? What if she wants to break up?

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720
♫ Even so it's better than being dizzy. ♫

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,130
- Is that all?
- Yes.

25
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,250
Is that what you call an explanation?

26
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,740
Since that's all there is to it.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,900
♫ There isn't anyone who loves you as much as I do. ♫

28
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,360
She laughed. Yumi laughed!

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,440
What's going on? Is it not over?

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,100
♫ Ordinary things don't suit you at all. ♫

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,250
Come up. Let's eat it together.

32
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,110
♫ My crush. ♫

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,700
♫ You will always be my crush. ♫

34
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,860
We did it! She told us to come up.

35
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,190
We're going inside Yumi's place!

36
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,890
That's right. Happiness isn't just something that comes to you.

37
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,620
Happiness comes with trials.

38
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,510
Hit the drums! Hit the drums!

39
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,720
It's the beginning of love.

40
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,480
Error! Error! Error!

41
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,280
- It's here.
- Oh.

42
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,020
Guys, let's calm down! What should we start with once we're inside?

43
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,100
- What about a back hug now?
- A back hug?

44
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,850
Oh, back hug! It's good timing for that. Do you like it too?

45
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,830
- Wung, come in.
- Okay.

46
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,660
What's that? Heart, stop.

47
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,110
Mic test. Mic test. Can you hear me?

48
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,090
Isn't that the colon cell's voice?

49
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,400
This is Colon speaking. To all the village cells,

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,660
due to a stomachache, I'm going to release that 'thing' soon.

51
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,290
Can you hear me well?

52
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,340
I need to go poop.

53
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,630
What are you talking about? Are you saying you're going to poop at a time like this?

54
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,750
Colon, are you crazy?

55
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,690
Yes, that's right. Happiness always comes with trials.

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,190
I guess there's no way for there to just be happiness.

57
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,320
I cleaned up everything and aerated the room.

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,360
Wung!

59
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,190
What are you doing, Wung?

60
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,690
Why isn't he coming in?

61
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,030
- What were you doing?
- Huh?

62
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,060
Come in.

63
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,400
We decided to face the ordeal confidently.

64
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,910
Who knows if there will be another chance to come to Yumi's house.

65
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,460
However ...

66
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,600
My house is a bit small, right?

67
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,460
No, it's cozy and nice.

68
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,250
Let's eat the cake.

69
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,170
Yes, let's.

70
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,330
Wow, it's pretty. I really like strawberry cheesecake.

71
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,330
- Wung, what are you doing?
- Huh?

72
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,900
Come here, let's light the candles.

73
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes.

74
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,150
Should we turn the lights off and sing?

75
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,100
All right.

76
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,650
The button is over there.

77
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,490
Emergency! Emergency!

78
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,360
'That' is being released from the colon now.

79
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,900
No!

80
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,120
It's the first time coming to your girlfriend's house. Try to hold it in at any cost!

81
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,860
Can you hold it in?
No.

82
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,790
Is it too difficult, even for one minute?
Yes.

83
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,790
You need to run to the restroom right now.

84
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,460
Damn it! Is there no other way?

85
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,630
- There is one.
- What is it?

86
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,720
Searching

87
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,070
- You can do it in your pants.
- What?

88
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,870
You have to sing for me, Wung.

89
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,560
Wung, sing!

90
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,360
- Huh?
-Aren't you going to sing "Happy birthday" for me?

91
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,420
Ah... That's right. The song...

92
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:33,620
♪ Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, ♪

93
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,790
♪ Happy birthday dear Yu— ♪

94
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,660
- The restroom...
- Huh?

95
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,790
Where is the restroom?

96
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,020
- Huh?
Where is the restroom?!

97
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,460
It's over there.

98
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,500
- The door isn't opening, Yumi.
- You have to push it! Push it!

99
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,400
Push it?

100
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh no.

101
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,530
Splash

102
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,430
Mission clear. 'That' has been released.

103
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,690
We're doomed. We're doomed.

104
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,990
I can't believe he pooped

105
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,800
right after coming to his girlfriend's house for the first time.

106
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,500
This is embarrassing.

107
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,220
Was there something wrong with the pasta I ate earlier?

108
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,810
Why all of a sudden...

109
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,170
- Wung.
- Yes?

110
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,830
Are you sick? Do you have a stomachache?

111
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,140
No, no!

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,930
Should I blow the candles? They're all melting.

113
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,070
No, don't! Just wait a minute. I'll be right out.

114
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,960
All right.

115
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,060
Love, let's forget what's already happened.

116
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,630
Our cute Yumi will understand that much.

117
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,030
That's right. We can start over now, right?

118
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,960
What should we do now?

119
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,970
Let's set the mood by giving Yumi a congratulatory kiss when she blows the candles! What do you think?

120
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,430
- Right?
- A congratulatory kiss sounds good.

121
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,130
What's the problem now?

122
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,460
We shouldn't have faced this trial,

123
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,540
instead we should have gone home earlier.

124
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,630
No. Please don't do this.

125
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,630
Is the toilet clogged?
Yes

126
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,560
Do you need tools?
Yes

127
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,900
Unsuitable

128
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,350
Ask Yumi for help.

129
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,330
I can't.

130
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,160
I can't do that.

131
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,280
I can't wait any longer.

132
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,290
Why isn't he coming out?

133
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,510
Is he showering?

134
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,150
Shower?

135
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,690
Why is he showering?

136
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,350
Wung, I was wondering why you weren't coming out.

137
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,430
Yumi.

138
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,110
Yes. What's wrong?

139
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,790
- Do you have ...
- Yeah?

140
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,250
that thing at home?

141
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,120
That thing?

142
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,550
Yes, I need that thing.

143
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,430
What thing is that thing?

144
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,960
You know. There's that thing.

145
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,660
If you don't have it, I'm going to go buy it right now.

146
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
Oh.

147
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,630
That thing.

148
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,210
Do you have it?

149
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,410
I don't.

150
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,990
You don't?

151
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,220
- You don't have the thing to unclog toilets?
- What?

152
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,490
The toilet is a bit clogged, so I need it.

153
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,130
- The toilet. The toilet is clogged!
- A little bit.

154
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,220
- I have that.
- You do?

155
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,880
And here I was, thinking he meant something else.

156
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,960
Wung.

157
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,530
- Here.
- Thank you.

158
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,450
But isn't it better if I do it though? I've done it many times.

159
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,010
No. Thanks, but no thanks.

160
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,470
I'll take care of my business myself.

161
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,420
This is so embarrassing.

162
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,870
Did it work?

163
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,360
This is bad!

164
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,920
- Wung.
- Yes.

165
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,120
Why? Isn't it going well?

166
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,130
No, it's fine. I'll be right out, just wait.

167
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,810
I'll do it. Open the door.

168
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,230
It's all done.

169
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,680
You can start eating the cake.

170
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,290
We should have gone home.

171
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,820
We should have gone home as soon as

172
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,160
we got the signal.

173
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,700
- Hello?
- Yes, hello?

174
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,190
- Colon!
- Reason, I'm sorry,

175
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,650
but I'm calling since I need to send that out again.

176
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,930
What did you say? Are you crazy? You're out of your mind!

177
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,990
Do you know where we are? We're not at home, we're at Yumi's place!

178
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,490
There's nothing I can do, though.

179
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,860
It's an automatic discharge system, as you know.

180
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,360
The problem must have been the cream pasta we ate earlier.

181
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,030
You punk! The toilet is clogged! The toilet! And you're going to poop more? More?

182
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,260
Why are you angry?

183
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,320
Seriously.

184
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,960
My stomach.

185
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,570
Does this make sense? At my girlfriend's place?

186
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,750
I'm so embarrassed I could die. Why isn't this unclogging?!

187
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,860
Wung. Are you all right?

188
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,270
I unclogged it

189
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,100
and I cleaned it up neatly.

190
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,860
You didn't have to clean up.

191
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,020
I'm sorry this happened as soon as I got here.

192
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,160
- What about the cake?
- I put it in the fridge, since you were taking so long.

193
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,970
- Do you want to eat it?
- No, never mind.

194
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,860
I think the cream upset my stomach.

195
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,090
Yumi, I'll just go.

196
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,730
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

197
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,760
No. I think I just need to go home and rest.

198
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,700
Drink this. It's plum tea. It's good for upset stomachs.

199
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,370
It's all right. I think it's better if I go home as soon as possible.

200
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,530
Go after you feel better. What if you get a bellyache on your way home?

201
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,690
What else can he do? He'll just poop in his pants. Why does it matter?

202
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,260
He's ruined anyway.

203
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,620
No. I'll be fine.

204
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,060
Yumi, hurry up and go to bed. I'll just go home—

205
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,560
Come here.

206
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,760
Lie here. I turned on the heating mat.

207
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,490
Isn't this your bed? No, I'll just go home–

208
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,230
You have to warm up your body. Just lie down.

209
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,390
Lie down comfortably.

210
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,190
Drink this and stay a little longer. It's going to calm your insides.

♫ I had an unexpected day ♫

212
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,800
♫ You sang to me ♫

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,900
♫ Song song song ♫

214

- Do you want me to give you medicinal hand therapy?
- Medicinal hand therapy?

215
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,230
♫ Can't think a word that ♫

216
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,830
This is very effective. You'll probably feel better.

217
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,160
♫ You sang to me ♫

218
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,760
Yes. It's true that happiness comes with trials.

219
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,960
Wow. You have a lot of books. Have you read all of them?

220
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,500
- Of course, I have.
- That's an unexpected hobby.

221
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Why? Didn't I tell you?

222
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,810
I once wanted to be a writer.

223
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,150
- Really?
- Yes.

224
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,390
A romance novelist.

225
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,320
I gave it up early, though.

226
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
Why did you give up?

227
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,380
I didn't think I was that talented.

228
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,330
Why? It suits you.

229
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,520
Writer Kim Yumi.

230
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,620
What about you? Was it your dream to become a game developer?

231
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,760
No. My dream was to play games for the rest of my life,

232
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,670
but it turns out you can't live on just playing games.

233
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,950
It sounds like something you would say.

234
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,630
Is that your mother?

235
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,520
Yes. My mom. And that's my dad.

236
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,580
And that's my maternal grandmother.

237
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,420
I lived with my grandmother until high school.

238
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,310
Although she passed away,

239
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:04,330
whenever I got a bellyache, my grandmother would do this for me.

♫ Baby has a potbelly, Grandmother has a healing hand.

241

This isn't a potbelly.

242
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,830
Babies have potbellies. Cute potbellies.

243
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,500
Wung!

244
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,780
- Aren't you late?
- I still have time.

245
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,080
Then, should we eat something before we go?

246
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,430
Sure. But is your stomach feeling better?

247
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:56,210
Absolutely fine. Now that it's all out, I'm starving.

248
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,980
Let's go.

249
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,690
- It's really good!
- It is.

250
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,420
It's even better because we're eating together.

251
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,680
Should we go on a trip?

252
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,470
- A trip?
- Over the weekend, for three days and two nights. What do you think?

253
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,730
Sounds good.

254
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,560
Where should we go? The mountains?

255
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,390
- The sea?
- The sea? Yes.

256
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,610
The sea.

257
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,520
I think we'll remember this morning for a long time.

258
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,200
- This means that Colon did a great job.
- Busan?

259
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,160
Thank you, Colon cell.

260
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,040
Then Sokcho.

[A trip to Sokcho that couples must do.]

263
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,080
Wow, it is nice.

264
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,650
It is. What's with the beach first thing in the morning?

265
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,890
- Just because.
- Are you planning on going with Wung?

266
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,370
Wow, how did you know?

267
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,780
I saw you used your vacation right after the weekend.

268
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,570
- You saw that?
- Yes I did.

269
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,990
Where are you going?

270
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,430
He wants to go to Sokcho and Yangyang.

271
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,550
Looks like you're going to visit the sea.

272
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,270
Must be nice, Kim Yumi. You're going on a trip with your boyfriend.

273
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,690
Yes, it's so nice. If you're so jealous, you should go too.

274
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,950
How can you say that to your lonely friend?

275
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,500
I hope it pours.

276
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,400
I'll still be happy.

277
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,190
So, what are you going to do in Sokcho?

278
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,640
I don't know. Wung said he would make the plans.

279
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,260
You should plan your trip together. Why are you leaving it all to him?

280
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,840
- Really?
- Yeah.

281
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,950
But it's been so long since I went on a trip, so I have no idea where to start.

282
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,560
Did you know? It's my first trip since that time.

283
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,220
When?

284
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,670
That trip to Phuket we went to, two years ago.

285
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,330
Seriously?

286
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,150
- You haven't gone on a trip since then?
- No.

287
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,530
Well, I didn't have a boyfriend to go with.

288
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:54,390
And weirdly, I didn't want to travel much after that.

289
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,190
Maybe it's because I'm getting old.

290
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,570
It was not because she was getting old.

291
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,100
It was because the travel cell was no longer with us.

292
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,650
Travel cell

293
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:14,050
You didn't even get to show your amazing abilities. You left us too early.

There is a graveyard in the village for the cells that have died because they have not been active for too long.

After the Phuket trip that cost three months of her salary two years ago,

297
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,360
Yumi never went on a trip again, so Travel was buried here.

298
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,670
It was a shame you had to go like that.

299

You know, when Yumi gets an awesome boyfriend someday,

300
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,500
I'm going to send her on the most spectacular trip. You'll help me when that happens, right?

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,880
Of course!

This is the moment you've always dreamed of.

It would've been so nice if you were here.

Although I lack experience, I'll do my absolute best for you!

Okay, I'll try to put that in the schedule.

You can do that in the day too, right?

320
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,330
No! It has to be white sand at dawn which nobody has stepped on!

321
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,510
It won't be easy, but I'll try to fit that on the schedule.

322
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,820
Reason!

323
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,420
I want to go on a makguksu* tour.
(buckwheat noodles in a chilled broth

324
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,970
Makguksu?

325
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,490
If you pour

326
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,820
the cold dongchimi* broth directly over the buckwheat noodles,
(water kimchi made with Korean radish)

327
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,500
then put a piece of boiled pork on it, and take a bite,

328
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,080
It's rather good. What's your rating?

329
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,710
I like everything ... But the sourness of the dongchimi is a little too intense.

330
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,650
So I'm giving it a 4.5.

331
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,330
You have a sharp palate, Kim Yumi. Let's eat.

332
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,830
It's my dream to meet the seventh master of makguksu in Gangwondo.

333
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,890
I don't think we'll have enough time.

334
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,250
I'll write it down for now.

335
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,870
What? A makguksu tour?

336
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,290
Face masks? Beach? Makguksu?

337
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,690
Are you guys joking right now?

338
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,290
Then what about you, Naughty?

339
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:28,740
Forget all that. The essence of a couple's trip is

340
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,830
a hot, passionate night!

341
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,910
♫ I need to get hit

342
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:41,450
♫ with the club of love

343
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,480
Yumi, what kind of accommodation would you like?

344
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,740
Accommodation?

345
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,620
Hotel, pension, condominium, shared house, etc. Do you have a preference?

346
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,980
My preference?

347
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,520
I'm not sure. I'm fine with anything.

348
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,570
Then what do you think of this place?

349
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,630
Julie Hotel is considered one of the most beautiful hotels in Gangwon-do. Enjoy the refreshing breeze blowing from Mt. Seorak to the East Sea.

350
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,320
Wow.

351
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,520
It's right by the beach. What do you think?

352
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,850
I like it. I like it a lot but it looks expensive.

353
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,870
If you like it, then I'm making a reservation.

354
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,410
All right.

355
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,860
It's nice.

356
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,730
I think I'd be so happy if we laid there and did a face mask together.

357
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,580
There is a white sand beach right in front. We can take a walk early in the morning.

358
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,320
On top of that, that place is only five minutes away

359
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,990
from the best makguksu place in Sokcho. Awesome!

360
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,740
I got it. I got it. Then we'll do this on the first day.

361
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,050
They'll check in, have makguksu for dinner, put on face masks to relax—

362
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,580
Forget it. Don't bother making a schedule.

363
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,800
There's no need for one. Because Yumi...

364
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,190
has no reason to leave their bedroom.

365
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:25,660
They'll just be stuck to the bed saying, "Oh that's too much."

366
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,290
Yumi will be satisfied with just one bed.

367
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,360
Gu Wung

368
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,150
Hello? Hey, Wung. Did you make the reservation?

369
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,450
- No, not yet.
- Why not?

370
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:04,010
The hotel server went down so we can't make reservations online. They said we can only make reservations by phone at 12 o'clock.

371
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,970
Really?

372
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,160
But I have an investor meeting to go to.

373
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,270
- An investor meeting? Isn't that important?
- Yes.

374
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,250
So I was wondering if you could make the reservation for me.

375
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,550
All right, I'll do it.

376
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,360
- Wung, let's go.
- Yes.

377
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,780
It's Julie Hotel. I'll send you my credit card number and their phone number.

378
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,820
You'll probably have to call them right at 12. It's pretty popular so we won't get it if we're late.

379
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,090
All right, I'll make sure to do it.

380
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,020
Don't worry, just trust me.

381
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,170
Bye.

382
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,370
What time is it?

383
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,800
11:00

384
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,040
All right, let's go eat.

385
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,050
If we don't go now, we'll have to stand in line again.

386
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,590
Somewhere in my office?

387
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:56,560
Section Chief. Can we eat out today rather than at the cafeteria?

388
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,110
I'm sick of the cafeteria food.

389
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,570
Let's do that then. Let's eat out.

390
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,030
You're the best.

391
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,570
Assistant Manager Kim, what are you doing?

392
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,600
I don't feel like eating, so please go ahead without me.

393
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,290
- Aren't you going to eat?
- No.

394
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,520
I have some things to do.

395
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,430
Oh, all right.

396
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,950
What was that?

397
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,420
You exchanged some looks just now. What is it?

398
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,440
We didn't. Let's go.

399
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,100
What is it that she has to do? Ruby is curious.

400
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,550
- It's nothing.
- Is it a secret from me?
- There are no secrets.

401
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,950
Enjoy your lunch.

402
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,100
Eleven thirty.

403
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,780
Assistant Manager Kim, aren't you going to eat?

404
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,430
No, I'm all right.

405
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,420
Enjoy your lunch.

406
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,490
I'm nervous. Why am I so nervous?

407
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,670
Five.
[The current time is 11:59:55, July 27th, 2020.]

408
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,320
Four, three,

409
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,380
two, one!

410
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,780
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

411
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,120
- Hello. This is Julie Hotel with the best views in Sokcho.
- They answered.

412
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,990
Please press the number after the beep.

413
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,720
One for reservations.

414
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,070
This is Julie Hotel, always trying our best, what can I help you with?

415
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:43,600
Hello? I'd like to reserve a room for August 1st and 2nd.

416
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,500
Yes, ma'am, what kind of room would you like?

417
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,470
An ocean-view, double-bed room, please.

418
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:54,020
Ma'am, I can't really hear you very well. Can you speak up a little bit, please?

419
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,110
Which room are you talking about with an ocean view?

420
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,600
A double-bed room.

421
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,000
Excuse me?

422
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,290
A double... double

423
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,600
One big bed.

424
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,870
Oh, you mean a double-bed room, right?

425
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,800
But currently for the ocean-view...

426
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,720
we only have twin-bed rooms left for August 1st and 2nd.

427
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,890
Sorry?

428
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,780
Well, that can't be helped. Then it'll be an ocean-view, twin-bed room—

429
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,530
No! Are you joking?

430
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,940
How can there be two beds?

431
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,120
That can't happen on a couple's trip. It has to be a double-bed, no matter what!

432
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,710
It's cold. So cold.

433
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:55,300
It doesn't have to be an ocean-view room.

434
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,760
Do you have any other rooms with a double bed?

435
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,940
A double bed room that's available for reservation currently is...

436
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,970
one with a parking lot view. Would that be all right?

437
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,300
A view of the parking lot?

438
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,070
It's unfortunate but we'll just take the double-bed room with a parking lot view—

439
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,260
No! No way! Why would you go all the way to the beach and look at the parking lot?!

440
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,850
You're up?

441
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,780
Good morning.

442
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,750
Good morning.

443
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,980
But Wung, the view is so...

444
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,160
shitty, right?

445
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,250
It really is shitty. I cannot give up the ocean view.

446
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,760
I don't really like the parking lot view.

447
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,730
Are those two my only options?

448
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,600
We do have one ocean-view double bed room but customers usually don't take it.

449
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,230
Which one is that? I'll take that one.

450
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,660
It's a full-glass bathroom. Would that be all right?

451
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,150
You can make a reservation for that room.

452
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,330
A full-glass?

453
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,230
Should I wash up first?

454
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,020
All right.

455
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,670
Okay, then.

456
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,480
It can't be helped.

457
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,950
That's it. Let's take that.

458
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,920
Do you really want to do this one?

459
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,930
It has the view that Sensitivity likes and it has a double bed. What's the problem?

460
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,310
I think the view would be nice in many directions.

461
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:06,200
Let's take it. Let's take it. It's a chance given by the heavens.

462
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,470
Then we'll reserve this one—

463
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,760
No way! No!

464
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,910
Etiquette.

465
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,160
Are you in your right mind?

466
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,130
There are rules and there's etiquette in this world. How can you take

467
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,930
that outrageous full-glass bathroom for the first trip with a man?

468
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,810
So indecent!

469
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,960
Etiquette, there are no other rooms—

470
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,150
No way. Never! Then just go on a day trip.

471
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,800
What? You wench!

472
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,920
The full-glass bathroom is a little

473
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,720
overwhelming.

474
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,240
I will think about it a little more and get back to you.

475
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,500
Thank you.

476
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,310
What should I do?

477
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,550
Should I ask Wung?

478
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,600
I should. I'll tell him to make the decision.

479
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,370
That'll make it simple.

480
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,120
The puppy character can be customized by the player

481
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,800
to make their own unique character.

482
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,360
As you can see, you can even choose hair types.

483
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,170
There are thirty different hair colors regardless of long hair or short hair.

484
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,250
And their patterns can also be customized. Spots...

485
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,440
What should I do?

486
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,640
- A double bed!
- Let's just take the parking-lot-view with a double bed.

487
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,710
Do you want to die? Then we can't see the ocean!

488
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,960
I said it's better to do a day trip.

489
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,020
All right. I've made up my mind.

490
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,360
Whether it's big or small, we can just use one bed.

491
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,890
This is Julie Hotel with the best service always. What can I help you with?

492
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,880
This is Kim Yumi, I just called.

493
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,230
I'll just take the ocean-view, twin bed room.

494
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,600
I'm sorry, but that room's been taken.

495
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,940
Sorry? Already?

496
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,470
It hasn't even been five minutes yet. Then what about other rooms? Are they all booked?

497
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,880
The double-bed room I mentioned earlier is the only one left.

498
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,430
You said you didn't want the full-glass bathroom–

499
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,900
It doesn't matter! I like full-glass bathrooms! Please give me the full-glass bathroom!

500
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,000
All right, ma'am.

501
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,470
What did she just say that she likes? What kind of bathroom?

502
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,830
A full-glass bathroom. I heard it.

503
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,610
That's not what I said.

504
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,930
I'm having my shower booth redone at home.

505
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,530
I'm on a call. Did you enjoy your lunch?

506
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,600
Yes.

507
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,450
She did say she's remodeling.

508
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,900
It's fine. I'll just take the room with the full-glass...

509
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:34,430
I mean, I'll go with the double room.

510
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,280
Yes. Yes. I'll pay with a credit card.

511
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,620
I can't believe it, this is indecent.

512
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,350
Since we won, you should get lost, please.

513
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:51,430
We're going to see the full-glass bathroom.

514
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,540
It's the end of the world.

515
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,630
I don't know what Wung is going to say.

516
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,300
Wung wanted to choose an ocean-view double bed room from the start.

517
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,020
We just did what Wung asked us to. What's the problem?

518
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,180
That's right. We've booked lodging. Let's plan the trip itinerary.

519
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,170
That's right. We need to prepare for the next step.

520
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,420
Is it finally my turn? I need to start preparing lingerie.

521
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,280
I think it's going to be a really romantic night.

522
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,830
Where are you all going? What about the other travel plans?

523
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,120
Guys, this is a trip. We're not just going to sleep!

524
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,840
♫ Are you paying attention to me? Or is it meaningless? ♫

525
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:37,900
♫ Do our eyes keep meeting. Or were you just looking at something behind me? ♫

526
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,360
♫ It's busy inside my head all day long ♫

527
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:48,350
♫ I'm going to continue to hide it so you won't know how I feel. ♫

528
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,630
Yumi.

529
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,530
- What's up with the car?
- I borrowed it from my friend.

530
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,150
We're going to have fun, so we should at least set the mood.

531
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,170
♫ You are smiling ♫

532
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,460
- This looks cool.
- I'll take this.

533
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,140
♫ I have my hunch that ♫

534
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,290
♫ I care about you. ♫

535
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,100
I'll take you there safely and carefully.

536
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,690
Thank you, Driver Gu.

537
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,720
Put on your seat belt.

538
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,950
♫ I want to hear your heart ♫

539
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,970
Here. Morning coffee.

540
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,730
Thank you.

541
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,960
- It's refreshing.
- Today's weather is great too. I think we picked a great day to go on a trip.

542
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,800
You're right.

543
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,390
- Let's go to the hotel first. We can go out after we've put away our luggage.
- Sounds good.

544
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,190
I heard it's really hard to book Julie Hotel's ocean-view rooms. Good thing we were able to book one.

545
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,150
Thanks for your hard work, Kim Yumi.

546
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,450
Don't mention it.

547
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,030
There's something I haven't told you yet.

548
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,860
Oh right! I heard Julie Hotel has some bizarre rooms.

549
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,240
Do you know they have rooms where the bathroom walls are all glass?

550
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,920
- What?
- You can see people taking care of their business and showering. Isn't that totally bizarre?

551
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,270
Why would they design such a room in a high-end hotel?

552
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,880
Who would reserve that except for perverts?

553
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,560
Perverts would probably like it.

554
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,960
If you reserve one, it's like proving you're a pervert. Who would reserve those rooms?

555
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,190
We're departing. Go go.

556
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,570
Go.

557
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,960
Error

558
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,300
Episode 17
Here comes the Great Majesty

559
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,070
The weather is so nice.

560
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,110
It is.

561
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,470
Yumi. Aren't you hungry?

562
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,890
I'm fine for now.

563
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,640
Then let's go a little further and stop by a rest area. I heard the view is really nice there.

564
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,570
Sounds good.

565
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,560
♫ Leave our tired hearts behind ♫

566
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,490
♫ And think of someone ♫

567
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,710
♫ I've been wasting my thoughts ♫

568
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,190
♫ On these things that have nothing to do with me ♫

569
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,040
Gyoyang Rest Stop
 ♫ In these times ♫

570
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,420
♫ That I always spend the same way ♫

571
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,880
Are you not getting out?

572
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,730
I'm just going to stay here and listen to music. Is that okay?

573
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,860
- Don't you need to go to the restroom?
- I'm fine.

574
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,510
Then should I buy mini potatoes and sotteok-sotteok*? You like those.
(sausage and rice cake skewer)

575
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,170
- Yes. Sounds good.
- Okay.

576
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,410
Answer, answer. Hurry up and answer.

577
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,240
Hello. This is Julie Hotel with the best views in Sokcho.

578
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,510
Please press the number for the service you need.

579
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,070
This is Julie Hotel, always trying our best–

580
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:29,440
Hello? I need to modify my reservation. It's under Kim Yumi.

581
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,190
I made a reservation for two nights starting today, but I want to cancel it.

582
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:37,620
It's not possible to get a refund if you cancel on the day of your arrival. Would you still like to cancel?

583
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,560
- You won't refund anything?
- That's right. We can't refund if you cancel on the day of the reservation.

584
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,040
Then can I switch to a different room? The view doesn't matter.

585
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,140
Parking lot views or twin beds are good too.

586
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,010
Julie Hotel.
Sokcho

587
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,370
All the rooms are booked for today.

588
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:02,040
I really need to change the room. Any room is fine. Please.

589
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,180
It's not possible for now, but I'll contact you if any bookings get canceled.

590
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,020
Just in case there isn't any, I have a situation,

591
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,850
so I'll just cancel the reservation.

592
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,100
We can't refund you. Is that all right with you?

593
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,170
- Yes, there's no other—
- It's non-refundable!
- No!

594
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:30,500
Do you know how much that room costs? If you're going to cancel, then kill me first.
Non-refundable

595
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,810
Would you like me to cancel your reservation?

596
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,780
No. Never mind. I understand.

597
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,940
Thank you.

598
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,110
Non-refundable

599
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,240
What should I do?

600
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,550
There's no other way. Given the situation,

601
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,870
- We have no choice but to deny it.
- Deny it?

602
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,070
We have to deny it. Say we didn't know about the full-glass bathrooms.

603
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,770
We can't become a pervert.

604
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,380
We've arrived. Julie Hotel. Can you see it?

605
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,810
Yes. It looks nice.

606
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,210
- What's the name the reservation is under?
- Kim Yumi.

607
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,080
You've reserved an ocean-view double room for two nights.

608
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,970
Yes, that's right.

609
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:46,740
Here you are. Enjoy your stay.

610
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,820
- Let's go.
- Yes.

611
00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:00,060
If it's on the 19th floor, the view must be really nice. Good choice, Kim Yumi.

612
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,510
Julie Hotel

613
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,970
Let's go in.

614
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:21,310
Look at that view. That's a real ocean view.

615
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,140
Wow.

616
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,910
What is that?

617
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,970
What is this?

618
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,440
What's wrong?

619
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,480
Yumi, look at this. The bathroom.

620
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:45,780
Oh my goodness. Is this the bizarre room you mentioned earlier?

621
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,700
What's going on?

622
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:55,280
There are probably blinds or something. There's nothing.

623
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,680
- There's really nothing?
- There's really nothing.

624
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,040
What is this? Is there no other bathroom?

625
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,980
Wait a moment.

626
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:19,910
I wonder what happened? I just booked a double-bed room with an ocean view as you told me to.

627
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,950
It's an ocean-view double room all right.

628
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,740
- Did they tell you the bathroom is like this?
- No.

629
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:34,120
That's ridiculous. They should've told us in advance. How can we shower here?

630
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,110
You're right.

631
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,050
This is absurd.

632
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:47,070
But the view is so nice. Let's just forgive them because the view is nice.

633
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,740
Are you really fine with this?

634
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,580
I'm not fine, but what can we do? It's happened already.

635
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,550
Can't we just take turns leaving the room when the other person is showering?

636
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:04,150
Still. How can we—

637
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,840
I'm fine with it, Wung.

638
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,980
I'm really fine with it.

639
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,620
Well, if you're fine with it then...

640
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:18,220
I'm happy just to be able to stay at Julie Hotel.

641
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,350
Thank you, Wung.

642
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,510
It worked. It worked. He believes us.

643
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,680
Our acting was so great. Now we can have a great time!

644
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,110
Look at that. It's the ocean.

645
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,850
It's so nice. Wung, this view is really amazing.

646
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,070
I really like this place.

647
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,690
Wung, come out and take a look.

648
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,630
Wung!

649
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,130
Where did he go?

650
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,210
Wung!

651
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,700
Yes, Yumi!

652
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,350
Wung, where are you?

653
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,040
- I'm going to the lobby.
- Why?

654
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,100
I'm going to make a complaint. I can't just let this pass.

655
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,080
Why? The room is nice. I told you I'm fine with it.

656
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,650
No, I have to say what I have to say. Just relax.

657
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,280
Wung! Wung?

658
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,660
All right. Yes, understood.

659
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,210
How can I help you?

660
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,500
We just checked in a little while ago.

661
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,760
I see. Is there a problem with your room?

662
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,880
- There is.
- What's the problem?

663
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,840
The bathroom is full-glass.

664
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:05,570
Pardon? Oh, that room has a special full-glass bathroom.

665
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:11,360
That's the problem right now. We made a reservation for a standard ocean-view double bed room.

666
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,790
Excuse me, but how can we use the bathroom if we're embarrassed?

667
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:18,020
Don't you need to notify us in advance when we make the reservation?

668
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:22,390
I'm pretty sure we did inform you. There are exactly three such rooms in our hotel.

669
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,490
If the customer doesn't ask for that sort of room first, we have a rule of not giving it.

670
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:31,070
I'm complaining because I got that room when I didn't want it.

671
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,710
That's not possible.

672
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,230
Where did he go?!

673
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,750
Hello?

674
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,780
Wung, where are you? I don't see you in the lobby.

675
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,730
I'm in the hotel's office.

676
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,280
The hotel's office?!

677
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,800
They keep saying they informed us in advance and are blaming you for it.

678
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,190
So I got upset and came to meet the reservation manager.

679
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:04,470
They could have just apologized, but they kept saying that it isn't their fault.

680
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:10,110
I said let's hear the recording then and they said let's hear it.

681
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,150
What did you say? No, Wung. Stop.

682
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,690
We came here to have a good time, what are you doing? What's the point of listening to the recording?

683
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,420
I'm just asking for my consumer's rights.

684
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,630
When I'm mad, I see things to the end.

685
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:26,990
Sir! You said you made the reservation on the 27th at 12 o'clock, right?

686
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,850
Yes.

687
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:31,330
Yumi, hold on.

688
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,320
Wung, no!

689
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,400
He—Hello?

690
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,710
What is this? You said it would be fine if we just denied it.

691
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:45,100
What? Who knew Wung was such a persistent guy?

692
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,760
Why in the world is this happening?

693
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,330
Excuse me.

694
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,080
- Where is the reservation office?
- Excuse me?

695
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,350
The reservation office.

696
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,380
Oh, you have to go that way.

697
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,630
Thank you.

698
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:07,320
Listen to this. This employee talked to Kim Yumi on the phone twice.

699
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:13,570
This is Julie Hotel with the best service always. What can I help you with?

700
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,230
I'd like to reserve a room for August 1st and 2nd.

701
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,650
Yes, ma'am, what kind of room would you like?

702
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,200
An ocean-view, double-bed room, please.

703
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,700
See? An ocean-view with double-bed room! Right?

704
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,530
When is she asking for a full-glass bathroom?

705
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,150
Then what about other rooms? Are they all booked?

706
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,480
The double-bed room I mentioned earlier is the only one left.

707
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,790
You said you didn't want the full-glass bathroom–

708
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,400
- Yumi, when did you—
- Let's go.

709
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,340
Wait. Wait a moment. I haven't heard it all yet.

710
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,520
I- I asked them to give me that room. I was the one who asked them to give me that room.

711
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,370
What?

712
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,180
I asked them to give me that room. Let's go now.

713
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,510
Wait—

714
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:06,590
It doesn't matter! I like full-glass bathrooms! Please give me the full-glass bathroom!

715
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,190
All right, ma'am.

716
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,990
We're screwed.

717
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,100
What do we do?

718
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,220
We're screwed. We're screwed.

719
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,590
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

720
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,590
We're screwed.

721
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,890
What's wrong with him?

722
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:43,480
I told you I was the one who asked for that room.

723
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,580
I told you, right?

724
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,060
Have a nice day!

725
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:01,360
There were no other rooms left.

726
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,320
I see.

727
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,890
Then, shall we go?

728
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,730
Yes.

729
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:19,220
♫  What is obvious while looking at me today  ♫

730
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,180
Have a nice time in our hotel.

731
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,790
♫ Although there aren't enough clues, I have my hunch that ♫

732
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,130
♫ I care about you ♫

733
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,360
♫ I want to hear your heart ♫

734
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:40,510
♫ Are you paying attention to me? Or is it meaningless? ♫

735
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:43,880
♫ Will I continue to be conscious of the smallest hint? ♫

736
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,580
Where should we go?

737
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,000
♫ I'm so curious it's driving me crazy ♫

738
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,720
Are we going to our room?

739
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,250
Huh?

740
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,500
Or...

741
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,450
Shall we go out?

742
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,810
Huh?

743
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,970
You're hungry, right?

744
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,800
Let's eat first.

745
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,670
All right.

746
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:10,660
Yes. All right.

747
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,170
Let's go.

748
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:25,290
What did I say? What did I say?

749
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,780
We're screwed.

750
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,960
Didn't I say that we shouldn't get the full-glass bathroom room?

751
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,660
You went too far after listening to Naughty, that lewd devil.

752
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,110
Now we are so humiliated.

753
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,660
Etiquette, would you mind being quiet?

754
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,160
Reason has lost his mind right now.

755
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,140
Whatever will be, will be.

756
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:55,340
Try the suyuk* too.
(boiled pork)

757
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,040
It's good, right?

758
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,480
Yes.

759
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,020
Where should we go after we're done eating?

760
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,930
Anywhere.

761
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,340
What should we do about the room?

762
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,260
It's a little uncomfortable, but the view is nice. Should we just use it?

763
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,190
It's the weekend, so it'll be hard to reserve anywhere else.

764
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:33,290
You told me to reserve an ocean-view, double-bed room.

765
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,410
That's why I did it.

766
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:40,210
- I know.
- That was really the only room left.

767
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:44,110
- All right.
- It wasn't because I like the full-glass bathroom.

768
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,560
I got it.

769
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,120
Why are you laughing? Are you laughing at me right now?

770
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,710
Do you think I'm a pervert?

771
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,140
No, it's not that, it's because you're cute.

772
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:03,340
Cute? You always say cute when you don't know what to say.

773
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,000
- I thought it was funny so I just–
- What's so funny?

774
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,990
I'm serious right now.

775
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,670
The situation is kind of funny.

776
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:14,760
I never laughed when you came over to my place and had diarrhea all night.

777
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,900
Compared to that, this situation isn't even funny, don't you think?

778
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,130
Just a sec! That was a little harsh. How can she bring up diarrhea?

779
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:30,180
Woah. She's just saying that because she's so embarrassed by this situation.

780
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,850
We need to be understanding right now.

781
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,670
Hey!

782
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,910
Out of the way!

783
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,030
The great king is coming!

784
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:42,230
Who is that?

785
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,790
He is... it can't be!

786
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,490
- He's the second son of Prince Angry. They say when he comes, he stays for three years. He's ...
- He's...

787
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,930
He's King Salty!

788
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:01,240
The king's feeling uncomfortable. Everybody out of the way!

789
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,770
No!

790
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,770
Your Majesty!

791
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,770
I apologize for saying this but you can't be salty right now.

792
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,470
Yumi is very embarrassed and ashamed by the situation.

793
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:15,370
We need to be understanding. Please be sympathetic.

794
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,880
What? Don't tell me he's already salty?

795
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,820
His personality is horrible.

796
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,540
Ppoong!

797
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,630
Is that so?

798
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,890
Yes, well...

799
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,440
I guess you're right.

800
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:04,580
Put yourself in my place, how you would feel?

801
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,820
I don't think I'd feel good.

802
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,750
Then what should we do? Should we just go back home?

803
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:18,860
We can just cancel the hotel and go home. Do as you wish.

804
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,000
- Now?
- If you want to go, we have to go now.

805
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,820
Even if we leave now, we'll get home at night.

806
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,270
How can we go back home? We don't have to go this far.

807
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:33,600
Please stop being salty, your Majesty.

808
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,330
Ppoong!

809
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:42,970
I don't really care.

810
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,560
I'm just worried it might be too hard for you to drive.

811
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,790
I'm fine.

812
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,130
- Yeah?
- Yes.

813
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:53,540
Then well... whatever. It doesn't matter to me.

814
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,320
Then let's go.

815
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,000
- I'd like to pay.
- All right.

816
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,300
We're going back home?

817
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,730
Good thinking.

818
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:11,710
Let's go home rather than be treated as a pervert.

819
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:16,440
No! We came all the way here. What are you saying?

820
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,530
Eonni Makguksu

821
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,020
Let's go.

822
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,420
Can I turn on some music?

823
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,790
[Holiday]

824
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,590
I thought you were canceling the hotel.

825
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,520
I should.

826
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,150
Shouldn't you do it now?

827
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:10,250
It's non-refundable anyway. I can do it at a rest stop.

828
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:21,140
Oh, the bags! We left the bags in the room. What do we do?

829
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,550
We can just go get them.

830
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,720
Look at the ocean.

♫ A holiday where through the leaves there was a small boat and me. ♫

♫ Spread your arms and follow the wind's path. ♫

835
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,810
Can you go up and grab the bags?

836
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:38,730
I'll cancel the room since I'm here.

837
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,090
What can I help you with?

838
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:55,150
I'd like to cancel my room. Room 1920.

839
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:59,050
I will check and help you with that. Just a moment.

845
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,970
Why do we have to go home when it's this romantic?

846
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:47,200
I don't want to go home. You said we'd take a walk on the beach early in the morning.

847
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,970
I wanted to do a face mask together on that bed.

848
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:55,270
We still have six more makguksu restaurants left.

849
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,780
You know how much that room cost? Although I wasn't the one to pay for it,

850
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,920
still this is crazy!

851
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,470
Be quiet! Everybody stop crying.

852
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:08,760
We need to stand firm if we want to rebuild our broken dignity.

853
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,670
What is she saying?

854

01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,680
Why did you come up?

858
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,850
To help you with the bags.

859
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,540
- Are you going up?
- Yes, I'm going up.

860
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,550
Excuse me.

861
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:48,660
Did you cancel?

862
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:53,090
Are they really not refunding even a little bit?

863
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,210
That's so mean. I'm never coming back here.

864
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,980
I didn't cancel.

865
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,940
- You didn't?
- I didn't yet.

866
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,080
I wanted to ask you first.

867
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,650
Why? You said you were canceling.

868
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,640
- It felt like a waste.
- You said it was fine.

869
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,420
Not the money.

870
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,360
I don't want to waste this moment.

871
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,890
Should I cancel?

872
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:34,710
Do as you wish. It's your credit card.

873
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,260
Yumi.

874
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,670
Let's not cancel.

875
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,240
I like that full-glass bathroom.

876
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:00,650
- What?
- I actually like full-glass bathrooms.

01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:08,050
There you go again! No! You have to maintain your dignity—

Dignity or whatever, get lost!

How insolent! Let me go right this moment!

880
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:17,610
How long are you going to be salty like that during this important moment?

881
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:19,650
We caught King Salty!

Yumi, you have a boyfriend? She claims that she has one, but there's no proof.

Wung, you're my boyfriend.

You need to come to my friend's wedding as my boyfriend.
