Episode 30
What's wrong, Wung?

4
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,000
What's wrong?

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
What's wrong?

6
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,880
What's wrong?

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,440
What's wrong?

8
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,990
What's wrong?

9
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,320
I am Wung's training cell.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,380
I practice saying "What's wrong?" all day long.

11
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,260
What's wrong?

12
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,200
What's wrong? What's—

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,870
What's wrong?

14
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,100
But, I don't really know when to use these words.

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,720
What's wrong?

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,580
What's wrong?

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,700
It's my duty to learn the tradition that has been passed down and spread it to future generations.

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,530
What's wrong?

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,290
What's— Damn it!

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,030
Tradition or whatever. I'm sick of it!

21
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,270
What are you doing not practicing?

22
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,810
Master, I want to do something productive like other cells.

23
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,940
Not useless things like this.

24
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,840
You rascal!

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,940
It is also important to train to say "What's wrong".

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,660
Why aren't you immediately getting back up?

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,260
What on earth does "what's wrong" mean?

28
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,740
What's so important about it that I have to train like this?

29
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,120
"What's wrong" is something Wung's mom passed onto him.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,500
His mom?

31
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,640
That's right. When Wung's mom said "what's wrong" softly,

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,400
Wung's sharp dad

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,780
used to melt like snow.

34
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,250
"What's wrong" isn't a useless technique.

35
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,840
It's the greatest one ever.

36
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,170
When someday Wung finds himself in a critical situation,

37
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,560
that would be the day

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
you can go down the mountain.

39
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,350
Please do it as quickly as possible.

40
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,180
Yes, don't worry.

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,020
- I'll contact you.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,300
I put my apartment up for sale.

43
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,260
You're going to sell your place to get funds?

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,650
What are you going to do?

45
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,480
There's no other way.

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,840
I don't even have money to pay the monthly rent for the office starting from the new year.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
Still, selling your house...

48
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,380
I was going to tell you to try to contact Sae Yi.

49
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,150
Why would I?

50
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,410
Sae Yi's company said they were interested in our game.

51
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,150
So if it doesn't work out, you should consider selling it to th—

52
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,280
According to whom? I'm never selling it.

53
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,210
Since you don't have money.

54
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,760
I told you I selling my house. You don't have to worry about it.

55
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,800
I didn't know this would be this hard.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,200
It's really not easy to start up a company.

57
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,450
Why aren't things going the way we want?

58
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,990
Honestly, I don't have any money to contribute so I can't really say much,

59
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,330
but don't you miss those days

60
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,280
when we used to get paid monthly and ate warm meals?

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,560
This is the last box. Please check that there isn't anything left.

62
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,670
All right, thank you.

63
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,170
♫ I looked forward to your heart ♫

64
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,590
That's fabric softener!

65
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,020
♫ It finally returned. ♫

66
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:20,820
♫ I want to be comforted ♫

67
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,740
SLW Studio

68
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:51,770
♫ I was looking forward to your heart ♫

69
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,200
♫ It finally returned. ♫

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,140
♫ I want hang onto you ♫

71
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:15,780
♫ Before we get farther apart ♫

72
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,730
Did you make it home safely?

73
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,150
Yes, where are you?

74
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,690
I'm at home.

75
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,990
Did you eat?

76
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,920
Yes, a little.

77
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,690
Hey, Yumi.

78
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,000
Were you sleeping?

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,390
No, I'm not sleeping yet.

80
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,050
Where are you right now?

81
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,730
I'm home.

82
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:20,000
Wung, I'm in front of your house right now.

83
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,110
What?

84
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,070
You're not home, are you?

85
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,510
Where are you?

86
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,770
Wung, what's going on?

87
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,640
Yumi.

88
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,770
You sold your apartment?

89
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,890
Yes.

90
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,780
When?

91
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,680
About a month ago.

92
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,050
Did you sell your house to develop your company?

93
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,530
I ran out of funds.

94
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,960
I had no other choice.

95
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,170
And you didn't tell me that something this big was going on?

96
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,420
It's not a big deal. It's something everybody encounters when starting up a company.

97
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,370
How can this be not a big deal,

98
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,020
when you're living without a home like this?

99
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,710
Look at yourself. With your beard and your sleeping bag.

100
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,800
What the hell is this...

101
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,020
I'm growing my beard longer on purpose, so it doesn't count.

102
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,190
You're joking at a time like this?

103
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,220
I'm asking if you are joking at a time like this?

104
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,790
Am I really your girlfriend?

105
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,810
Why do you always keep secrets from me whenever something important happens?

106
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,760
Master!

107
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,260
Master, something serious is going on in the village right now.

108
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,770
Something big must have happened.

109
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,710
The time has come for you to go down the mountain.

110
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,150
Go stop what is about to happen to Wung and come back.

111
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,280
Pardon? Are you talking about me?

112
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,930
How?

113
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,960
It's cold.

114
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,370
Use "what's wrong?".

115
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,180
What?!

116
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,450
'What's wrong?' isn't a technique to calm or appease people.

117
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,130
It's a technique telling that our relationship is very precious.

118
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,680
So the true 'what's wrong' technique,

119
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,000
should contain fear.

120
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,520
The fear that she could leave him.

121
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,260
Send that feeling to her.

122
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,320
Seriously but not bluntly.

123
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,410
Softly but not lightly.

124
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,230
With the fear that

125
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,710
this precious relationship might break.

126
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,030
What's wrong?

127
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,750
Yumi, what's wrong?

128
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,370
What's wrong?

129
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,400
Seriously...

130
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,390
What's wrong? Huh?

131
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,810
I stopped it. I stopped it!

132
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,430
Master! "What's wrong?" worked!

133
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,780
I stopped it!

134
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,000
Gu Wung, seriously you...

135
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,800
What should I do with you?

136
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,750
What the hell is all this?

137
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,540
This place isn't too bad. I can save commuting time.

138
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,380
So this is why you told me that

139
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,120
I shouldn't jump into new things so carelessly.

140
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,460
Starting new work is good, but it's something you've never done before.

141
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,360
I think it's better to keep improving on what you're good at now.

142
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,240
Life doesn't go the way you want.

143
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,900
I think we should always prepare for the worst.

144
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,570
It's not easy.

145
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,180
I'm telling you from experience.

146
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,790
I left a stable, well-paying company.

147
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,770
But a lot of things happened, that I hadn't foreseen when I left .

148
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:41,090
So, since you regret doing it, you think I'll regret transferring, too?

149
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,740
I don't regret it because I will succeed in the end.

150
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,380
But there are too many obstacles.

151
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,320
So I meant that it'd be hard to endure unless you are really determined.

152
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,310
I like what I do, so I can endure it, but you're not sure

153
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,540
if you really like marketing.

154
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,780
That's what I meant.

155
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,300
Think about if it's something that you like so much that you won't regret it

156
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,440
even if something were to happen.

157
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,520
Okay.

158
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,030
I got it, so let's go to my place for now.

159
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,020
You can't live here like this.

160
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,870
I don't want to.

161
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,190
Why not?

162
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:42,830
I don't like the idea of moving in with my girlfriend because I have nowhere to go.

163
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,890
It's a fact that you have nowhere to go.

164
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,560
I didn't go broke or fail, I just chose to be uncomfortable for a little bit for the sake of my dream.

165
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,140
It's a choice I made.

166
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,060
Please understand.

167
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,130
Gu Wung, you seriously ...

168
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,480
- He's proud, even though he has no other plan.
- Still, he has a sense of responsibility.

169
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,130
Let's just go. We have to think about his pride too.

170
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,340
Does pride feed you? Provide shelter?

171
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,200
How can we just leave after seeing this?

172
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,380
Wung is right. We can't just move in together without thinking about it.

173
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,290
We don't know what obstacles we'll face when we live together.

174
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,580
And we might regret it later. But at that point we won't be able to tell him to leave.

175
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,730
He said you won't regret it if it's something that you like.

176
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,640
Don't we like Wung?

177
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,630
Then why are you worrying in advance that we might regret it?

178
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,180
You're good with your words.

179
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,080
Let's go.

180
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm not going, Yumi.

181
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,160
You're really not coming?

182
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,600
I'll just stay here until I find a place. It's really comfortable here.

183
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,910
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,320
Even if you won't see me again?

185
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,430
- What?
- Even if this moment is our last moment together?

186
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,040
What the heck? Are you threatening me?

187
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,810
Even if it's not a threat and I really mean it?

188
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,140
- Yumi, what's wrong?
- Stop that now.

189
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,910
"What's wrong" isn't working anymore.

190
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,350
Maybe it doesn't work twice in a row? What should I do?

191
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,020
I will be back, Master.

192
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,090
- Hold on. Let me teach you another killer move.
- What?

193
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,520
Wung's mom's killer move is 'what's wrong'.

194
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,510
And this is Wung's dad's killer move.

195
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,990
If there is a crisis where 'what's wrong' doesn't work,

196
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,240
then say your name at the last moment.

197
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,340
I'm not just saying this.

198
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,320
Pack up now.

199
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,500
Wung (Okay).

200
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,730
You're coming with me?

201
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,760
Wung (Yes).

202
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,300
Obedience is the only way to survive.

203
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,440
Let's shave your beard first thing when we get home.

204
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,070
Wung (Okay).

205
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,750
Let's go.

206
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,270
But I'm really growing my beard—

207
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,850
Wung (Okay).

208
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,560
With the superior genes of the Gu family, Wung safely averted the crisis.

209
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,390
But there is still a long way to go.

210
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,720
Wung's hardships will continue on in the future,

211
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,210
and my training won't stop either.

212
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,610
Wake up!

213
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,760
Wake up!

214
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,240
Wake up!

215
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,470
Wake up!

216
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,090
Shoot! I'm late!

217
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,260
You should've woken me if you were up already.

218
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,550
I did wake you but you said you can sleep more.

219
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,720
That was sleep talking!

220
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,500
What do you want for breakfast?

221
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,310
I don't know! I'm not eating.

222
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,090
Yumi, eat this before you go.

223
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,300
No, I'm late.

224
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,840
You're not late yet. I'll get a cab and drop you off on my way. It'll only take 20 minutes.

225
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,810
You're broke. What cab?

226
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,570
What do you mean? I'm rich in cash because I sold my place.

227
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,000
- I can ride the cab hundreds of times.
- Aigoo.

228
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,720
Sit.

229
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,770
But Wung, I'm going to transfer to the marketing department.

230
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,310
I made up my mind.

231
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,700
Did you give it a lot of thought?

232
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,460
Not a lot but I want to try it.

233
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,070
I'm not responsible if you regret it.

234
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,600
Well, just because you have a clear goal, it doesn't mean you will be successful.

235
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,890
I don't know, but after trying it, I might like it,

236
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,920
and I might have a new goal while trying it.

237
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,570
Don't you think?

238
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,290
You're right. Eat.

239
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,750
Actually, many important things in life often start unexpectedly.

240
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,140

244
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,090
They won't kick me out.

245
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,540
You never know. You might be the first one to make the record of being kicked out.

246
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,440
Watch it.

247

Then let's have dinner together. I'll have it ready.

Oh, right. I have something to tell you.

What is it?

267
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,870
I'll go to the marketing department.

Although I'm a little scared.

269
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,710
You made a good decision.

270
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,700
It is, right?

271
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,500
Of course. I'm really glad.

Sorry?

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,960
What are you doing? Are you looking for a certain book?

325
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,400
No, its not that.

326
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,300
How are you categorizing these books?

327
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,940
Categorize? I just put them in.

328
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,970
You don't have a system?

329
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,480
It looks like all of the books here are romance novels.

330
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,420
Yes. I really love romance novels.

331
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,350
You have romance and not romance.

332
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:46,250
I think it will be much better to separate romance by author and then organize it alphabetically.

333
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,130
- Huh?
- Then it'll be much easier to find books.

334
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,740
It would be easier. But when would I have time to do that?

335
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,940
Or do you want to do it for me?

336
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,650
- Really? Can I?
- What?

337
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,610
Should I organize them? I'm really good at things like this.

338
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,480
Sure, you can do it. That'd be good for me.

339
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,040
Thank you! I'll organize really well!

340
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,340
You don't really need to thank me..

341
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,140
Since there are six shelves,

342
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,770
if we distribute three consonants for each shelf, then it'll be just right.

343
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,340
ABC, DEF, GHI, JKL... YZ!
(The Korean alphabet has 14 consonants and no name begins with a vowel)

344
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,080
And then the rest...

345
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,400
What's with him? Why does he like it so much?

346
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,770
What's with him? Why does he like it so much?

347
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,490
Does Wung like house chores?

348
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,500
Oh, so that's why his house was always so clean.

349
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,100
No wonder.

350
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,430
What are Wung's cells like? I bet its so different from our Housework cell.

351
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,940
Are you guys talking about me?

352
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,740
Yes, you! I want to see how different his cell is compared to you!

353
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,790
All right!

354
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,030
Even when Wung came over the first day,

355
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,570
Thank you.

356
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,270
Let's go.

357
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,810
I turned off the heater before leaving, so it'll be cold.

358
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,190
- Wait Reason ... did we clean?
- Clean?

359
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,500
This is the first time bringing Wung in without us preparing.

360
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,880
We probably cleaned, right? Because I'm worried.

361
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,080
When we left in the morning I think everything was–

362
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,720
That! The laundry on the drying rack!

363
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,120
You didn't take in the laundry? What were you even doing on your day off?

364
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,040
Sit, sit.

365
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,150
Reason, we're in trouble. That is not all!

366
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,800
Is there something else?

367
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,640
Oh no! Where did Housecleaner go?!

368
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,370
Agh! What were you doing not folding the laundry?

369
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,950
I was going to do it tomorrow. I guess I'll do it now!

370
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,730
You're going to fold the laundry while Wung is here?!

371
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,540
Then I guess I'll do it tomorrow!

372
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,730
You need to hurry and figure it out, Wung is already here!

373
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,810
Really? Then I guess I just need to do a little laundry kick!

374
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,440
Let's go ... laundry kick!

375
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,390
Finishing it off well!
Laundry kick: Technology to send laundry to the 4th dimension

376
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,550
Are you satisfied?

377
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,500
That's...still not everything.

378
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,450
Look at the pillows ... the drool marks.

379
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,580
What are we going to do about the hair?!

380
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,800
I told you to wash the pillowcases more often!

381
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,970
You did, you did. I was going to do it next week.

382
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,170
- Why I ought to...!
- It's all right!

383
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,410
I know a method that makes them look good as new.

384
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,670
You just got to turn the pillows 180 degrees.

385
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,990
Now they look clean, right?

386
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,820
It's not something to be proud of.

387
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,510
And, that!

388
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,140
The snack you were munching on yesterday. Why didn't you clean it?

389
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,070
♫ Even if I walk carefully ♫

390
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,780
♫ My heart is far away there ♫

391
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,110
♫ Even at night when everyone else is asleep ♫

392
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,980
♫ It's racing wide awake ♫

393
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,580
That's not a problem. The answer is there!

394
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,210
You just got to hide it as one of the books.

395
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,570
Doesn't that look natural?

396
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,960
Oh my goodness.

397
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,070
Now it's time for me to sleep! Goodnight!

398
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,610
♫ Even if I spend a day when nothing happens ♫

399
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,350
We've always lived like this.

400
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:19,020
But.. look at Wung. Look how different he is.

401
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,150
Wung, coffee.

402
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,780
♫ Even if I knew I can't do anything with my heart ♫

403
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,950
Wung, should I help you?

404
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,620
There are too many Lees. There are too many Lees.

405
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,520
- Huh?
-You have a lot of books by the author Lee Dong Gun.

406
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,650
Yes, I like the author Lee Dong Gun.

407
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,610
And that is why there isn't enough space for the third consonant. There are too many Lee's.

408
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,210
Ah ... what should I do?

409
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,880
Wung, it doesn't matter to me if the books are in alphabetical order.

410
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,680
Oh?

411
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,320
Oh?

412
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,450
This isn't a book.

413
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,660
These are crackers! Why is this here?

414
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,820
Oh wow. You're right. How did this ... get there?

415
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,780
That's it! Now if I put these last books in there ...

416
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,740
It's done! Book shelf, success! Success!

417
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,740
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

418
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,910
Good job. Now come and eat this! It's all cooled now, so it won't be as good.

419
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,910
There's a lot of dust on the floor, so I think I'll clean it first.

420
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,510
I'll clean it. You come eat.

421
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,010
No, no. Where is the mop?

422
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:49,140
The length of this ... 40 cm.

423
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,460
And the floor is...

424
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,240
from the bookshelf to the bed, 160 cm.

425
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,770
Can I wipe it all perfectly, in just 4 sweeps?

426
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,290
Let's do it.

427
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,800
Look at this! It fits perfectly.

428
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,920
Look at it. This is it!

429
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,590
It's so thrilling.

430
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,410
Thrilled ... while cleaning?

431
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,850
It's my first time seeing someone get so excited by cleaning.

432
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,390
On top of that, that person being my boyfriend,

433
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,040
is even more surprising.

434
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,020
Before we lived together, I didn't know...

435
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,540
What?

436
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,310
What is it? What are you looking at?

437
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,510
Yumi.

438
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,300
- Yes?
- Can you get up for a sec?

439
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:34,510
The poster is too far to the left in relation to the bed.

440
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:39,300
- What?
- It's too late to put in a new nail.

441
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,620
I have to push the bed.

442
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,790
So as to line up the poster with the middle of the bed. Okay.

443
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,720
Is this good? Yumi, take a look.

444
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,200
- Is this good?
- Hmm? Yes ...

445
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,290
I think it's good.

446
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,320
Is it?

447
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,760
Okay, it's good.

448
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,930
Now I feel better.

449
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,680
- Yumi, what do you think?
- Huh? I like it.

450
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,140
Wung loves to keep things organized.

451
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,040
Perfect.

452
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,700
This is impressive.

453
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,220
You hung the pots by their size.

454
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,650
I couldn't just let it go.

455
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,940
Your nickname from now on is neat freak. It's confirmed.

456
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,450
At this rate, you're going to organize my underwear drawer.

457
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,260
Why aren't you answering? Did you already do it?

458
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,110
- I didn't yet.
- Not "yet". Don't do it!

459
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,640
But I can do it really well.

460
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,320
- No. Don't do it. No way.
- I got it.

461
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,800
I won't do it. Okay. Sit.

462
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,060
- You won't do it, right?
- Right.

463
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,680
Enjoy your food.

464
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,360
Gosh.

465
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,960
You're a lot cleaner than I thought.

466
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,140
I didn't know you like organizing this much.

467
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,130
It's not that I like organizing.

468
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,510
I like finding the continuous regularity of an arrangement.

469
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,770
Cleaning is a kind of a mathematical process.

470
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,530
If you make a clear algorithm for cleaning, you can apply it anywhere.

471
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,990
And I'm neat because of that.

472
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,430
That's so impressive. He's diligent and efficient.

473
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,220
He even has scientific reasoning. He's at a master's level.

474
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,630
Hey, don't you feel anything?

475
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,910
I do. Wung's great!

476
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,070
Not that. Don't you think you should learn from him?

477
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,230
What do I need to learn?

478
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:41,020
The person who loves doing it should just do it. I'm off to get some rest.

479
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,080
Should I kill her?

480
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,520
Wung's housework cell?

481
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,440
Yes. Since you've been to Wung's village, you've probably seen him.

482
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,210
I want to learn their technique and pass it down to our housework cell.

483
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:01,820
Well... from what I can remember, Wung didn't have a housework cell.

484
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,970
What? How can he be so good at housework when he doesn't have a housework cell?

485
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,050
Instead, he has a huge artificial intelligence cell.

486
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,300
An articial intelligence cell?

487
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,690
Run the algorithm now.

488
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,370
Running the algorithm.

489
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,640
- There is such a thing?
- Yes.

490
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,590
When there was a problem, that was what solved everything.

491
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,030
Housework is probably determined there, too.

492
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,810
I'm jealous. I'm really jealous.

493
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,200
How efficient and scientific!

494
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,210
You don't even have to nag at the lazy housework cell.

495
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,130
And my work would be reduced so much!

496
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,080
That's the very world I've been dreaming of.

497
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,110
- Love, I have a favor to ask you.
- A favor?

498
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,090
Love wormhole opens pretty often these days.

499
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,630
Yeah, I guess.

500
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,510
When the wormhole opens today...

501
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,160
Yumi, coffee.

502
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,010
It's hot.

503
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,880
Wung, look over there. Isn't the moon exceptionally yellow today?

504
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,360
- Is it?
- Yeah, look over there.

505
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,370
- No, look at me.
- Hmm?

506
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:33,510
Send me to Wung's village.

507
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,640
Now!

508
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,450
Reason, be careful.

509
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:46,640
I'm not scared, Love. I'm so excited.

510
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,320
I'll learn a lot!

511
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,640
Wow, I'm finally here. So this is Wung's world.

512
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,980
A world ruled by science and logic. A world where reason is the most valuable.

513
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,220
What is that?

514
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,230
No!

515
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,250
No! Don't come to me!

516
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,820
Right, Naughtysaurus is probably on the loose right now.

517
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,980
Would Reason be all right?

518
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,550
No, let me down!

519
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,280
Yumi is so sexy!

520
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,670
I can't hold it in anymore!

521
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,840
I want to go home!

522
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,570
Wung's world was a world of chaos, where scientific logic and the madness of a beast coexist.

523
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:16,870
Let me down!
After that, I never dreamed of that place again.

524
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,760
Episode 32: Cake and Keyboard

525
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,140
Daehan Noodles

526
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,270
Assistant Manager Yumi.

527
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,490
Oh, Assistant Manager Yu.

528
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,890
Are you on your way home? I'm jealous.

529
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,780
- Are you not going home?
- I'm working overtime today.

530
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,790
- You know you're starting at marketing department starting next week, right?
- Yes.

531
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,850
If you have any questions regarding the transfer, let me know.

532
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:55,470
- Questions?
- Yes, don't you have any?

533
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,460
I do have a question.

534
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,680
The marketing department has a higher salary compared to other departments.

535
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,140
So is Yumi getting that much as well?

536
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,690
- Ask this, Yumi.
- What if she isn't?

537
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,760
It not, she shouldn't go. Why bother to transfer?

538
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,530
Stingy, you said you'll be my best supporter—

539
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,080
Go ahead and ask Yumi. Tell him no if they aren't.

540
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,780
Umm, I do have a question.

541
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,270
- What is it?
- By chance, my sal—

542
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,910
Sal?

543
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:35,640
Never mind. It's nothing. It's nothing.

544
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,940
I'll ask you when I think of something.

545
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,780
Sure. Have a great weekend.

546
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,240
You, too, Assistant Manager Yu.

547
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,980
Why is it so hard to talk about money?

548
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,450
- Oh, right! Assistant Manager Yumi.
- Yes?

549
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,380
Did you hear about your salary?

550
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,780
What? No.

551
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,210
You'll get a raise, too. I'll let you know the exact amount some other time.

552
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,330
Oh, sure.

553
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,950
Goodbye.

554
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,180
Stingy

555
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,050
Let's work hard, Writer.

556
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,910
Daehan Noodles

557
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,470
Hello? Wung, where are you?

558
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,810
I just left the office.

559
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,560
I just left, too. Wung, let's stop by the grocery store first.

560
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,490
We don't have any food at home. Let's make something yummy.

561
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,900
Yumi.

562
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,040
Yumi!

563
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,370
Wung.

564
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,340
I got here really fast, so I started shopping.

565
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,120
Why did you get so much stuff?

566
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,140
Wung, they said I'm getting a raise.

567
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,820
- Really?
- Yeah.

568
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,020
Marketing department always has the highest salary at my company.

569
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,340
And I guess they'll match that. I think I'll get a big raise.

570
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,490
That's good.

571
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,910
It is good.

572
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,480
So we can splurge today.

573
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,920
Hey, mandu are 'one plus one.'
(mandu: dumplings | 1+1= buy one, get one free)

574
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,210
Wait! That's a little...

575
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,820
It's not a lot. We can freeze it.

576
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,700
That's not what I meant.

577
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,040
This is tastier than that.

578
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,950
Yeah? But that's not one plus one.

579
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,940
That's two 400 grams, two of them 800 grams for 8,000 won (≈$7).

580
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,280
And this is 5,500 won (≈$5) for 500 grams.

581
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,590
That's 1,000 won per 100 grams but this is 1,100 won per 100 grams.

582
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,800
It's only a 100 won (less than 1 cent) difference. Shouldn't we go with the taste?

583
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,620
You're fast with calculation, Gu Wung.

584
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,660
I am pretty fast.

585
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,490
Then, pan-fried mandus for dinner tonight?

586
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,070
How about pairing them with bibim-ramyeon?
(Spicy instant noodle without broth)

587
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,000
Your culinary sense is no joke either, Gu Wung.

588
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,640
Let's go.

589
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,200
Did we get too much?

590
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,170
No, this won't even last one week.

591
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,170
Wung, I have to go to the bathroom.

592
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,010
All right. We don't need anything else, right?

593
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,240
No, there isn't.

594
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,110
Okay. Hurry and go.

595
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,000
- Wung, my credit card.
- It's fine.

596
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,390
No, I was going to buy today...

597
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,920
to celebrate my raise.

598
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,210
It's fine. Hurry and go. I'll wait outside.

599
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,030
Go ahead.

600
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,910
I was going to pay.

601
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,110
It's 182,840 won (≈$155).

602
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,350
Here you go.

603
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,050
Sir, I'm sorry. Do you have another card?

604
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,010
- Sorry?
- It says it's over the limit.

605
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,540
Hold on.

606
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,630
Try this one, please.

607
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,240
- One payment?
- Yes. Actually...

608
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,150
Three-month plan, please.

609
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,030
Three months...

610
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,390
Thank you.

611
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,970
Have a good day.

612
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,310
I suddenly had a tummy ache.

613
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,240
Are you all right?

614
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,580
Yes, I'm fine.

615
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,060
Wung, it was a lot, right?

616
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,060
No, it wasn't.

617
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,140
How much was it? Let me pay for some. I got a lot of stuff.

618
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:13,240
Yumi, do you know what money they use in Australia?

619
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,910
Huh?

620
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,770
Australian money.
(Pocket and Australia are homonyms)

621
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,570
Yes! One joke per day has succeeded. Let's go.

622
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,530
- Give me a bag.
- No.

623
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,380
- Give me one.
- No way!

624
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,680
Let's hurry. Hurry!

625
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,160
Okay, there won't be any spots left later.

626
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,810
What's going on?

627
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,170
There are so many.

628
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,210
Let's stick it here so we can see better.

629
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,420
Everybody feels the same. I really hope it works out.

630
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,180
I'm so excited.

631
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:01,350
Let's get married and eat all three meals together.

632
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:06,310
Let's please put on a wedding dress.

633
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,910
Gosh, these guys!

634
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,810
- Yumi.
- Yeah?

635
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:24,720
Should we... do it?

636
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,820
It?

637
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,000
You know it...

638
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:40,960
We're in the middle of washing dishes. What are you saying?

639
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,450

That's too loud.

802
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:42,390
Happy, happy birthday!

803
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:51,300
I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?

804
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,730
He's here.

805
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:17,160
He's coming. He's coming.

806
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:27,000
Guys, when Yumi walks out of the closet, what do we say?

807
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,480
Surprise!

808
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,510
Here we go!

809
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,290
Ten! Nine! Eight!

810
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,420
Seven! Six!

811
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:43,130
Five! Four!

812
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:46,370
Three! Two!

813
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,320
One!

814
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,650
Go!

815
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,820
Surprise!

816
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,030
Hold on! Hold on!

817
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,070
Guys, hold on! We have an unexpected situation.

818
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,520
What's going on?

819
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,110
What the?

820
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:45,670
Did he leave? Why?

821
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:50,550
Is he really salty?

822
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,970
What is that?

823
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,490
Bluetooth mechanical keyboard

824
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,820
It's a keyboard.

825
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,440
Hello?

826
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,560
Wung, where are you going?

827
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,260
Huh?

828
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,870
Why did you come home then leave right away?

829
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:50,430
I'm going back to the office because I have things left to do.

830
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,570
But how did you know that?

831
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,190
Are you home? I just left.

832
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,620
What is this keyboard?

833
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,970
You saw? It's a present.

834
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,690
- A present?
- It's your first day at the marketing department tomorrow.

835
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,540
That's the best mechanical keyboard there is.

836
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,190
Famous writers all use that.

837
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,900
My first day of work present?

838
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,080
I want you to write good things.

839
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,830
What's going on?

840
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:27,200
Why are they like that?

841
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,780
- What's going on?
- Do you know?
- I have no clue.

842
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,530
I think I'll have to work all night so I just stopped by to drop that off.

843
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,970
I should be the one giving you a present.

844
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,100
Give me a present? Why?

845
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,790
It's your birthday.

846
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,530
Today?

847
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,200
- Is it?
- Didn't you know?

848
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:56,420
I didn't know. I totally forgot.

849
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:01,870
You remembered my first day of work and yet you forgot your birthday?

850
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,690
I'm kind of off these days.

851
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:11,110
When did you get home? I just left.

852
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,330
Hello?

853
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,770
Wung!

854
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,600
Come back.

855
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:32,000
Come home and eat. I made you a birthday dinner.

856
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,380
Happy birthday.

857
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:59,140
You made all this?

858
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,200
I'm so happy.

859
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,010
Let's cut the cake later.

860
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:09,890
Did you make this, too?

861
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,010
This is so touching, Kim Yumi.

862
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,690
Thanks for the food.

863
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,170
This is good. You made the seaweed soup so well.

864
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,200
- Wung.
- Yes?

865
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,000
Should we ... get married?

866
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,480
♫ Like the star ♫

867
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,740
♫ Always be at my side ♫

868
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:46,310
♫ Like a star shining in the dark night ♫

869
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:52,980
♫ always shine brightly by my side ♫

870
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,190
♫ Like a Star ♫

871
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:59,610
♫ while looking at me smile brightly ♫

872
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:05,920
♫ You who are so precious to me ♫

873
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:12,700
♫ Always by my side, remain at my side ♫

874
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:19,210
♫ Sometimes I sleep tightly curled ♫

875
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,830
♫ Hiding a lot of pain ♫

876
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,840
Yumi's Cells
♫ inside a lonely room ♫

877
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,090
- You two look so close.
- We just ran into each other a few times.

878
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,220
Of course I know. It's well-known.

879
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,650
While you are working out, you catch someone's eye.

880
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,680
Have you eaten dinner? Should I buy you a consolation dinner?

881
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:44,070
I think there is something between Ba Bi and Yumi.

882
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,310
What is with this combination?

883
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,840
Excuse me.

884
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,960
Hello. I'm Yu Ba Bi.

885
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,950
That action is a little weird!

886
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:57,400
No! There is a jerk giving his jacket right in front of the boyfriend!

887
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,800
♫ while looking at me smile brightly ♫
