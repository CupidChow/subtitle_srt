Episode 09
Frog

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,600
The lights came on!

5
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,720
- Sensitivity, are you all right?
- I'm all right.

6
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,670
What is this?

7
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,080
Isn't this snow?

8
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,010
- What is this?
- Why is it suddenly snowing?

9
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,030
Wow, it is sweet.

10
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,790
It is sweet!

11
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,250
- It's sweet!
- I'm mad!

12
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,990
Is it sugar snow? How is this happening?

13
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,990
Yumi didn't eat anything, though.

14
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,620
That's not it, Reason.

15
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,480
Then?

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,890
Why are you standing in the rain?

17
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,600
You'll catch a cold like that.

18
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,390
There are so many other sweet things in the world besides sugar.

19
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,870
Excuse me, hello.

20
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,590
Excuse me, Oppa Wung.

21
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,360
Hello, I'm Ruby.

22
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,310
Oh, yes.

23
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,110
Did you come to see Eonni? I was really surprised.

24
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,510
- Let's talk later.
- Ah, all right.

25
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,720
- Where are you going?
- Home.

26
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,660
Let's go. I will take you home.

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,960
There's something different about him from the last time I saw him. Why does he look so neat?

28
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,850
Taxi!

29
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,530
Because of the rain, there seems to be no available taxi. I can't even request one.

30
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,820
But...

31
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,080
Why did you come here?
- Huh?

32
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,020
Why did you come here at so late in the day?

33
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,750
Oh ...

34
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,460
I had something to do nearby.

35
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,950
Something to do?

36
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,420
Well ...

37
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,610
To be honest ... I was curious,

38
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,330
since you didn't reply.

39
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,990
I was curious why you didn't reply.

40
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,690
My phone was broken, so it is at the repair shop.

41
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,520
Really?

42
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,260
Ah, so that's what happened!

43
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,680
I thought...

44
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
I got rejected.

45
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,630
It has been a while since sugar snow came down like this. right?

46
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,710
True, I think it's been years since I last saw it.

47
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,690
That's right.

48
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,520
Who are you?

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,650
Gatekeeper cells, hello! I came from Wung's village.

50
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,750
Wung's cell? But why did you show up here?

51
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,610
I want to visit Yumi's village. What is the password?

52
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,560
What?! Do you think a man can easily get into Yumi's heart? Do you?!

53
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,260
This door has a password that is twenty-eight digits.

54
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,350
Twenty eight? Why is it so long? Wung's village password is only four digits.

55
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,370
If you know now, leave. For the past three years, nobody has been able to get through this door.

56
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,930
- Yumi is not an easy woman.
- That's right.

57
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,570
Can you just let me in? The mood is great right now.

58
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,240
- Get out!
- Why, I ought to...!

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
Searching for an available taxi.

60
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,860
Miss Yumi, the requests keep getting canceled. Should we go somewhere nearby--

61
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,110
Miss Yumi?

62
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,990
Miss Yumi?

63
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,650
It isn't rain. It is sweat.

64
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,310
Her temperature seems to be around 38 degrees Celsius.

65
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,630
It is an emergency! It is an emergency! Everyone focus

66
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,380
The goal from now on is to make sure we take Yumi to the hospital safely!

67
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,030
We don't have much time! Run the algorithm!

68
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,330
Loading

69
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,820
We will start running Wung's algorithm.

70
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,450
Start

71
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,930
Is there a hospital nearby?

72
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,820
Yes or No

73
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,600
Miss Yumi, wait a sec.

74
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,650
Is there a hospital nearby? Yes or No.

75
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,920
Is there a hospital nearby?

76
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,700
YES

77
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,300
Is it a distance where you can run and carry her there?
YES

78
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,660
Are you in a relationship where you can carry this princess?

79
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,670
NO

80
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,690
Is this the time to nitpick over that?
NO

81
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,500
It isn't.

82
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,490
Use skills to carry the princess.

83
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:52,220
Complete 100%
Use skills to carry the princess.

84
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,260
Can you carry the umbrella?

85
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,740
NO

86
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,630
Forget about it

87
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,020
Starting now, all the carbohydrates stored in the body will be released.

88
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,790
Wung Sprint Mode. Start.

89
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,770

Wait! Please take a look at her she's an emergency patient!

100
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,870
She's an emergency patient. Hurry!

106
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,160
Guardian.

107
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,430
You are the guardian, right?

108
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,660
Are you Kim Yumi's guardian?
NO

109
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,570
Although you are not the guardian, do you want to be her guardian?

110
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,330
YES

111
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,630
Yes, I am the guardian.

112
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,400
Her fever went down, so she just needs to get some IV fluids.

113
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,490
All right, thank you.

114
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,640
But since the patient's clothes are all wet, I think it would be good to prepare a change of clothes.

115
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,060
It takes about an hour to get all the IV fluids.

116
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,430
All right, thank you.

117
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,960
The situation is over. Mission clear.

118
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,540
Starting now begins self-admiring mode.

119
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,040
Self-admiring mode

120
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,010
- Hello?
- Where are you?
[Self-admiring]

121
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,550
Why aren't you coming? We're eating pajeon*. Where are you?
(Savoury Korean pancake with green onions)

122
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,610
- The hospital?
- The hospital?

123
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,380
Why are you at the hospital?

124
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,210
Miss Yumi? Why?

125
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,190
You punk, I wondered where you went. You went to her office?

126
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,570
If I hadn't gone, it could have been a disaster.

127
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,900
She had a high fever and she fainted.

128
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,080
How were you able to take an unconscious person to the hospital?

129
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,640
I carried her and ran. Of course, it definitely wasn't easy.
[Self-admiring]

130
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,390
I ran while holding her for about ten minutes.

131
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,830
You ran carrying her for ten minutes? You really have strong arms.

132
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,080
They're still numb.

133
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,350
Miss Yumi is light. She's light as a feather. I wonder why my arms are numb.

134
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,180
- Give it to me.
- You just wait! Hold on.

135
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,820
Say something.

136
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,360
Hello. You went after a woman who didn't reply to your message?

137
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,080
No, it turned out she broke her phone and left it to be repaired.

138
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,740
What is she supposed to say to someone who came to find her? It was an excuse.

139
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,950
An excuse?

140
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,820
You idiot.

141
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,920
- Well, so what? She's ill.
- You're hopeless.

142
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,720
- I just followed my algorithm.
- What?

143
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,250
According to my algorithm, this was the right choice.

144
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,270
You two have dinner on your own. I'm going to take miss Yumi home when she wakes up.

145
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,230
See you tomorrow.

146
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,650
Does he not have a brain? Why would he go there?

147
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,950
He's completely smitten with her.

148
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,440
He's just completely smitten with Kim Yumi.

149
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,200
It would look good on her.

150
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,260
Are you awake?

151
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Your boyfriend left this for you.

152
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,250
My boyfriend?

153
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,920
Your boyfriend went through a lot of trouble, getting soaked in the rain.

154
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,810
I was afraid he might catch a cold, but he went out to buy some clothes.

155
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,600
Your old clothes got all wet, so you should change into this.

156
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,220
- Stay put for a moment.
- All right.

157
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,480
It's a dress.

158
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,790
It's cute.

159
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,920
Should we have just let in Wung's cell?

160
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,590
But the password is so long.

161
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,340
True, true. Yumi's heart isn't easy to reach.

162
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,330
- It's not easy. It's not easy.
- Of course not.

163
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,050
Hey! Who are you?!

164
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,750
It's a frog. What should we do?

165
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,310
Should we let it in? Cute things can enter without a password.

166
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,880
That is true, but ... hold on.

167
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,420
The things that Yumi thinks are cute are puppies,

168
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,630
cats, chicks,

169
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,370
panda bears, and ... Oh! Frogs aren't on the list.

170
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,960
So what? Let's just open the doors, it looks cute anyway.

171
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,250
- Should we?
- Ribbit.

172
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,480
All right, why not.

173
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,920
On a rainy day, a frog

174
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,650
made its way into Yumi's heart.

175
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,120
- Who are you?
- Ribbit.

176
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,690
The frog that entered Yumi's heart like that, saved us cells.

177
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,930
It successfully sutured Hunger's taste buds back on.

178
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,400
He cleaned the village that had become polluted from stress,

179
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,270
and built a fence so Hysterius couldn't come back.

180
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,750
Love, look! Someone's coming!

181
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,920
He even found Love and Inner Feelings who had been stranded on a deserted island.

182
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,920
The frog did all of this by himself.

183
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,430
Although we just met, thank you so much, Frog.

184
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,990
- Love, I'm actually not a frog.
- What?

185
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,720
I played a small trick so I could enter Yumi's heart.

186
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,650
The password to Yumi's heart is too hard, you see.

187
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,430
Then, who are you?

188
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,230
Hi, Yumi's Love cell.

189
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,530
- Who are you?
- I am Wung's love cell!

190
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,170
- What?
- What?

191
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,570
- It's cute.
- Wung's love cell disguised himself as a frog

192
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,090
and entered Yumi's heart.

193
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,800
Oh! You're up.

194
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,460
How are you feeling?

195
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,760
Even Yumi didn't know

196
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,800
when he came into her heart.

197
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,460
Are you still feeling unwell?

198
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,270
No. I'm fine.

199
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,990
But ... where did you buy this?

200
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,560
Somewhere nearby. I chose it as best as I could because I didn't know your size.

201
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
You don't like it?

202
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,590
I do like it.

203
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,970
You do?

204
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,490
Yes. I like it.

205
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,560
It reminded me of the frog festival.

206
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,570
Exactly, it's cute.

207
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,200
You wearing that is cuter.

208
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,230
You're really good at flattery.

209
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,860
It's not flattery. I told you I can't lie.

210
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,710
I'll go pay the bill.

211
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,460
Do you want to have dinner with me?

212
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,800
You didn't eat yet, right?

213
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
Let me repay you. I'll buy you something good.

214
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,670
Repay?

215
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,430
Yes, because I'm grateful.

216
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,340
There's nothing to be grateful for. Anyone would've done what I did—

217
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,060
To tell the truth, I'm trying to ask you out on a second date.

218
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,440
Eat dinner with me.

219
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,550
Oh.

220
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,100
Are you rejecting a second date?

221
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,820
No, not at all. It's just that it's so late, so I think most places are closed.

222
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,070
They'll still be open until 9 pm.

223
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,170
9 pm? What time is it now?

224
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,920
What time is it? It's Seoul*.
(*T/N: Seoul the city sounds the same as Seoul time.)

225
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,790
I'm sorry.

226
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm a gentleman*.

227
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,850
*(This sounds the same as "I am Sim Sa Im Dang," a Korean artist from the Joseon Dynasty. She is on Korea's 50,000

228
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,070
That was good.

229
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:21,060
Episode 10
Bulletin Board

230
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,910
When Yumi is asleep, in the middle of the night,

231
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,320
the Dream Theater starts its late-night screening.

232
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,760
Wow, what's going to happen today?

233
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,190
It reminded me of the frog festival.

234
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,210
Exactly, it's cute.

235
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,300
You wearing that is cuter.

236
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,580
Must be nice.

237
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,280
Today's screening is a romantic comedy production.

238
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,950
It's over there.

239
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,450
- That house?
- Yes, I live on the fourth floor there.

240
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:12,320
Thank you for today and also for taking me home.

241
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,880
- Get some rest and make sure to take your medicine.
- All right.

242
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,560
I'll go now.

243
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,870
Text me when you get home.

244
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,920
Text you?

245
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,930
Because it is very late now.

246
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,700
But it will take more than thirty minutes.

247
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,520
It's all right.

248
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,190
But you don't have your cellphone.

249
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,350
Oh, right.

250
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,210
Good night.

251
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,040
I have my laptop. I can use Messenger on it.

252
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,120
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

253
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,760
Is it all right for me to wake you up?

254
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,140
I'm telling you that it's fine.

255
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,450
I'm not perceptive, so if you tell me to do it I really will do it.

256
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,120
Please do.

257
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,130
Go inside now.

258
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,710
To be continued

259
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,750
Dream Theatre

260
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,110
Wow! Every scene was good today.

261
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,560
After the late-night screening is over and all the cells are asleep,

262
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,210
there is a cell that starts working only then.

263
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,420
When the cells post their thoughts on the bulletin board throughout the day,

264
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,930
- Ruby is so annoying! - Wound Documenter
- There's a lot of expenses lately. - Stingy

265
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,820
We need more masks. - Anxiety cell

266
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,020
Those thoughts have an impact on Yumi's life the next day.

267
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,180
What exactly is love? - Sensitivity cell

268
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,830
The Bulletin Board cell throws away the useless stories.

269
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,850
The dongaseu* restaurant we ate at today was the best! - Hunger
*(Pork cutlet)

270
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,850
Wung lives in Jeongbalsan. - Reason

271
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,770
And he moves the stories that she has to remember to the top of the bulletin board.

272
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,480
Huh? What is this?

273
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,650
Sometimes he finds old thoughts that he doesn't even know when they were written.

274
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,660
Since when has this been here?

275
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:22,590
This is anonymous too. If these are left on here, Yumi gets stressed.

276
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,790
Chae Wu Gi is your destiny?

277
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,700
Destiny does not exist. It's all a choice.

It's because I couldn't get a taxi. Didn't you fall asleep yet?

Everyone has their own bulletin board. Of course, Wung does too.

305
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,490
Yumi is cute.

306

Yumi likes dongaseu.

307

Kim Yumi looks cute in short hair.

308

The hoodie dress looks good on Yumi.

309

Yumi's house is on the fourth floor.

She is Gu Wung's type.

Hello. Did you just get home?

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,490
You guys are still eating?

322
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,840
What happened?

323
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,220
- What?
- You said Miss Yumi was sick.

324
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,430
- Is she all right?
- Yes, she got better.

325
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,470
That's good. And?

326
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,700
And, what?

327
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,090
And, did you ask her to meet you again?

328
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,930
Yes. It wasn't an excuse that her cellphone was broken.

329
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,120
She probably felt sorry and agreed to go on a second date.

330
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,290
No, she was the one to ask me to go on a second date.

331
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,620
- No way.
- I'm serious.

332
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,930
Oh! Gu Wung is finally dating?

333
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,790
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

334
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,590
I was going to call you anyway. Come and take Louis back home.

335
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,990
- Why?
- He's totally knocked out.

336
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,480
Wake him up.

337
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,850
He won't wake up, no matter what I do.

338
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,170
All right.

339
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,840
Welcome.

340
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,060
You're here?

341
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,360
Did you drink a lot?

342
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,220
A little?

343
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,080
- Why?
- Since you got a girlfriend.

344
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,760
Louis, let's go. Get up

345
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,390
Sit down.

346
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,260
We should go. It is past midnight.

347
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,900
There is still some of this left. It would be a waste. Let's go after we finish it.

348
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,330
Thank you.

349
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,240
Ma'am, please give us another pajeon.

350
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
All right.

351
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,610
- We are going to leave soon, though.
- You like the pajeon from here.

352
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,480
I'm buying, so don't worry and drink.

353
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,180
Are you happy now that you're dating?

354
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,780
I've only met her twice until now.

355
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,760
That's why it is good. What a thrilling second meeting.

356
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,960
It was worth shaving off the beard you'd been growing for three years.

357
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,140
- I suddenly thought of that.
- What?

358
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,310
Sitting here with Louis is sleeping and while were drinking dongdongju*,
(Traditional rice liquor)

359
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,390
doesn't make you think of the past?

360
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,070
That dongdongju place in Hapjeong-dong.

361
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,800
You remember the dongdongju place

362
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,710
where we used to go to often, right?

363
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,010
Danger detected! Danger detected!

364
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,830
Danger sensed! Sae Yi is trying to talk about the past.

365
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:10,760
- No, when Sae Yi drinks and talks about the past, there's always a hidden motive.
- That's right!

366
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,870
It is dangerous. From now on Wung will be in defense mode.

367
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,440
Understood.

368
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,370
Wung is switching to defense mode.

369
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,830
Changing to bear mode.

370
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,340
Starting now, Wung will be a bear.

371
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,480
Someone who doesn't understand what you're saying and has no perception.

372
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,330
He will be dull and won't be able to remember the past.

373
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,220
Okay, this is good!

374
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,230
Back at that dongdongju place, when I was really drunk,

375
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,610
there was a time you came to pick me up. You remember, right?

376
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,280
- I did?
- You know, the day it was snowing a lot!

377
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,770
It snowed?

378
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,350
You came to pick me up and saw that I was drunk, so you got really angry.

379
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,900
Why were you so angry back then?

380
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,130
When?

381
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,760
When you were working at a company.

382
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,020
- Company?
- When you were living in Hapjeong-dong, there was a dongdongju place nearby. You don't remember?

383
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,520
Dongdongju place in Hapjeong-dong?

384
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,340
Where is that?

385
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,240
Nevermind. Forget about it.

386
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,430
Defense successful.

387
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,350
You used to like me, right?

388
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,750
That's right!

389
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,760
The cold wind keeps coming in. Is it all right there?

390
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,720
The second attack is about to start.

391
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,160
Sae Yi's ulterior motive: I want to sit next to you.

392
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,080
Should I move over there? It is cold.

393
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,560
Okay.

394
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,330
You should have told me sooner.

395
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,500
I was really hot, this works out.

396
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,660
- I wasn't asking you to change seats...
- Huh?

397
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,350
Nevermind.

398
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,920
Defense successful.

399
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,110
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

400
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,970
It looks good.

401
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,790
Aren't you going to eat?

402
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,020
I'm full.

403
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,060
This is a lot.

404
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,820
Wung...

405
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,520
The third attack is about to start.

406
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,970
Sae Yi's ulterior motive: Saying the truth while drunk

407
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,530
Should I tell you a secret?

408
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,120
- No.
- Why not?

409
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,160
It is a secret, so why would you tell? You don't have to tell me.

410
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,600
You know that I had a crush on someone when I was in college, right?

411
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,910
Do you know who that guy was?

412
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,940
- Seonbae Jin Su?
- What?

413
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,850
- Seonbae Jin Su.
- No, I really didn't like him.

414
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,690
- It is right! It was Seonbae Jin Su.
- I told you it wasn't!

415
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,560
I had such a hard time because there were rumors that I liked him.

416
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,810
Everyone knows that it was Seonbae Jin Su.

417
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,050
It isn't! Who started that rumor?

418
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,900
I did.

419
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,870
I'm right! It was Jin Su. It is a truth that everyone knows–

420
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,360
That's right.

421
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,830
- Louis is awake. Louis, let's go.
- It's a feast.

422
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,730
- It's smells good.
- Get up.
- Hi Wung.

423
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,520
But there's still some pajeon left.

424
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,720
- Ma'am, can you please wrap this up for me?
- All right.

425
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,000
- Wrap it up please.
- I'm full. Let's go.

426
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,650
Let's go.

427
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,210
Hey, bring this with you.

428
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,440
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

429
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,550
Defense successful.

430
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,330
It is so hard to grab a taxi today.

431
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,540
It's chilly now that it's the evening.

432
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,590
- The fourth attack is about to start.
- Again?!

433
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,120
Sae Yi's ulterior motive:

434
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,940
Physical contact

435
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,900
It's cold, right?

436
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,320
- Is it that cold?
- Yes.

437
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,230
Let's link arms, since it's cold.

438
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,230
Try this. You will be less cold.

439
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,640
Defense successful.

440
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,810
Don't stay up all night and go home. See you tomorrow.

441
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,550
You are not going to the office?

442
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,210
I'm tired. I want to go home. Good luck!

443
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,140
Mission clear. Turning off bear mode.

444
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,390
Everyone has a bulletin board in their hearts.

445
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,530
The same goes for Sae Yi.

446
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,490
Become the best Art Director! Let's be a legend in the game world!

447
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:54,100
I can do it! We are the eagle trio!

448
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,390
I'm never going to get married!

449
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:07,380
But if someday I get married ...

450
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,900
I am never going to get married!

451
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,910
But if someday I do get married, it will probably be to Gu Wung.

452
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,810
Episode 11
Naughty versus Naughtysaurus

453
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,230
It is 9 o'clock?

454
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,740
Crazy! Why did the alarm go off at 9 o'clock? What do I do?

455
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,100
Yumi, today is Saturday.

456
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,430
Ah...That's right, today is Saturday.

457
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,760
Yumi, today is the day of your date with Wung.

458
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,670
Yes, it is today.

459
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,570
Sleeping again? Are you all sleeping?

460
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,990
Fashion, the date is at 12 p.m. We can sleep more.

461
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,980
Are we not going to shop? I don't even remember the last time I did some shopping!

462
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,060
Do you want to meet Wung in the same old clothes?

463
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,170
Wung says Yumi looks cute no matter what she wears.

464
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,540
It might be cute the first couple of times, but for how long do you think that's going to work?

465
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,260
Forget it.

466
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,130
We need new clothes!

467
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,750
Yumi, wake up! We need to buy new clothes!

468
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,470
God, I am earnestly praying. Please wake up Yumi!

469
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:04,060
Please allow Yumi to go shopping!

470
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:13,710
Your prayer has awakened me, Fashion.

471
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,550
God! You have come! Spending God!

472
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:24,620
I will sing you a song because you are earnest.

473
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,230
A song?

474
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,730
♪ Do Re Mi– Do Re Mi Fa— ♪

475
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,340
♪ Pa Pa Pa, words that ends in Pa— ♪

476
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:41,070
♪ Onions, spring onions, chives, and leeks, I want to buy these ♪
(all those end with "-pa" in Korean)

477
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,840
Wow!

478
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,430
Repeat the song with me.

479
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:52,200
And Yumi will wake up.

480
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:58,210
♪ Pa Pa Pa, words that ends in Pa— ♪

481
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:04,050
♪ Onions, spring onions, chives, and leeks, I want to buy these ♪

482
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:10,310
♪ Onions, spring onions, chives, and leeks, I want to buy these ♪

483
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:16,850
♪ Onions, spring onions, chives, and leeks, I want to buy these ♪

484
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,750
That's right! Is it...

485
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,270
Did the sale not end yet?

486
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,770
It looks so good on you.

487
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,150
You found the perfect one right away.

488
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,350
I had my eye on it from before. I will get this.

489
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,460
Of course. You can bring it out when you change.

490
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,910
I'll just wear it out. Can you take the tag off?

491
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,570
Will you do that? It's perfect for today's weather.

492
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,360
- One moment, please.
- All right.

493
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,100
Thank you.

494
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,050
These are the clothes you wore, here.

495
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,900
Do you know if there are any lockers nearby? I don't want to carry this around.

496
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,430
Should we hold onto it for you?

497
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,040
Could you?

498
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,000
Yes, we can.

499
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,240
- Please write down your contact information here.
- All right.

500
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,550
Thank you.

501
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,100
Gu Wung

502
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,640
Hello?

503
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,090
Of course, I'm up. I'm already out.

504
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,910
Really? You stayed up all night?

505
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,860
Then I'll go somewhere close to your apartment.

506
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,560
I'm near there right now.

507
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,500
It's all right. I'll be drinking coffee.

508
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,320
Yes.

509
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,190
I'm heading down now. Where are you?

510
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,700
I'll go to you. It'll take me less than five minutes.

511
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,560
It's perfect. Glad you bought it, right?

512
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,700
Yumi, undo two buttons.

513
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,280
So that your collarbone shows. That's your attractive point.

514
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,670
Who is that?

515
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,030
Yumi's collarbone is sexy.

516
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,240
Naughty, you...!

517
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,570
Let's undo them.

518
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,240
Yes. Just like that, Yumi.

519
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,920
Don't give her useless advice. What do you know about fashion?

520
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,730
You don't even wear pants!

521
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,790
Stop it!

522
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,310
Fashion isn't important. When are they going to kiss?

523
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,380
- He said "kiss"!
- How could he say that!

524
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,940
- I'm so excited!
- Awesome!

525
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,270
Naughty, what are you doing? Don't provoke the others!

526
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,060
It's about time now.

527
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,320
We have to kiss today.

528
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,150
Stop getting so excited! They've only met a couple of times.

529
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,160
A kiss isn't a coupon. We don't need to fill out stamps.

530
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,390
You just do it if you feel like it!

531
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,240
- He's right.
- That's true.

532
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,290
Who's right?

533
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:08,020
- Yumi has waited long enough. I've waited long enough.
- That's right.
- He's right!

534
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,750
You can undo three buttons, Yumi! Undo them!

535
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,890
No!

536
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,690
It's not time for you to step in yet!

537
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,210
Come here.

538
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,480
Undo other things too!

539
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,320
What just happened?

540
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,000
Oh no! No wonder I was nervous that we might spill the coffee.

541
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,740
This was so expensive!

542
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,690
What happened?

543
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,350
Did you fall?

544
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,090
I spilled my coffee.

545
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,160
You spilled a lot.

546
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,670
So why would you call the Spending god? You're so dead!

547
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,420
Calm down, Stingy!

548
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,480
It'll be fine if we wash it right away.

549
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,340
She needs to change to continue their date.

550
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,630
There are the clothes she left behind at the store earlier.

551
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,580
You're right!

552
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,570
What should we do?

553
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,370
It's all right. Actually, at the clothing store—

554
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,350
Let's go to my place.

555
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,110
What?

556
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,980
He wants to go to his place? Let go of me!

557
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,510
Naughty, stay still!

558
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,070
If you come to my place and wash this immediately...

559
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,410
Your place?

560
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,810
Yes, my place.

561
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,680
Going to his place is a bit too much.

562
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,800
She can change at the clothing store and leave the dress at a dry cleaner.

563
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,140
It's a good thing we have another set of clothes.

564
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,610
Let's go to his place!

565
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,450
Let's go to Wung's place! It's an opportunity!

566
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,400
What opportunity?

567
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,720
Kiss!

568
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,660
It's right there.

569
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,450
But, at the clothing store...

570
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:23,540
Yumi, let's go to Wung's place.

571
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,840
The clothing store?

572
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,430
- What?
- What?

573
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,500
What do you mean?

574
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,130
Come in.

575
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,590
- Wait here.
- All right.

576
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,690
It's clean.

577
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,010
How is it so clean?

578
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:09,730
Space Rabbit

579
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,900
I don't have any size small clothes, but I think this is the smallest I own.

580
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,970
You should change so you can wash that dress right away.

581
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,450
Oh, yeah! This is where Wung showers!

582
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,870
Would you like some coffee?

583
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,500
Yes! That sounds great!

584
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,330
He must have showered recently. The scent is still lingering.

585
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,500
The scent of sexy muskiness.

586
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,510
I love it.

587
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:21,570
I like Wung because he's sexy.

588
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,760
Yumi, what are you thinking about?

589
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,830
%#*&^#%!

590
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,570
Somebody drag him away before Yumi gets weird!

591
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:05,680
Let go of me!

592
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,230
- Sorry, guys!
- The tree, @!#$, the tree!

593
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,190
You @*$^^$%^#!

594
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,270
Guys, Wung wasn't thinking of this.

595
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,190
He invited her over with innocent intentions, so let's not get excited!

596
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,770
Yes, let's not get excited.

597
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,560
The clothes are too big, right?

598
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,380
Yes, a bit.

599
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,670
That was the smallest size I had.

600
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,430
No! No!

601
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,830
Naughtysaurus, calm down.

602
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,830
Calm down.

603
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,270
Yumi is wearing my clothes!

604
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,800
Her collarbones are so sexy.

605
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,770
Everyone grab him!

606
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,320
- Come together.
- All right. All right.

607
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,470
Grab him! Grab him!

608
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,950
It is very big.

609
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,020
It is.

610
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,730
But that's the smallest that I have.

611
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,170
But you're still cute.

612
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,690
Am I cute again? I guess I am the embodiment of cuteness.

613
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,500
Give it to me.

614
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,220
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

615
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,050
You should act like a gentleman, okay?

616
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,770
You did well till now. Good job.

617
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,780
You can't mess up here.

618
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,180
Yumi will be disgusted to find you–

619
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,960
Calm down, okay?

620
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,500
Isn't that fabric softener?

621
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,080
What?

622
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,180
That's fabric softener!

623
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,960
They're going to kiss! Kiss!

624
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,480
Stay still!

625
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:21,130
Danger detected! Danger detected!

626
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,440
Entering into the carbon dioxide zone.

627
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,510
It's an area where you can feel the carbon dioxide emitted from each other.

628
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:33,700
If you enter this area, Naughtysaurus will get out of control.

629
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,420
Step back, Wung!

630
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,950
I said step back!

631
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,270
You're getting ...

632
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,410
What?

633
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,940
You're getting a call.

634
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,700
I'll do this.

635
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:23,160
Leaving the carbon dioxide zone.

636
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,100
Hello?

637
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,500
Yes, I'm home, why?

638
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,330
I think you have to come here. The file isn't opening all of the sudden.

639
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,640
What?

640
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,010
Something must have gone wrong while updating the Unity version. Louis can't open it either.

641
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,810
Ask him to come quickly. No, let me talk to him.

642
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,570
Hello. Wung, there's a problem.

643
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,650
Come quickly.

644
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,550
Okay.

645
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,660
Did something happen?

646
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,150
Unfortunately, I think I have to go to my office.

647
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,120
- Right now?
- Yes.

648
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,690
There seems to be a problem. It's a bit urgent.

649
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,030
I just started the washing machine.

650
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,230
Do you want to stay here? I'll be right back.

651
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:22,960
When will you come back?

652
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,700
I'm not sure.

653
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,110
I don't think it will be over soon.

654
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,300
Being here alone is ...

655
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,150
- Is that a bit too much?
- Yes.

656
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,210
A bit.

657
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,000
But you can't go out dressed like this anyway.

658
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,610
You need something to change into.

659
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,690
I do have something to wear.

660
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,850
- Excuse me.
- Welcome.

661
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:58,350
Do you have the clothes that a woman left here this morning?

662
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,910
Yes.

663
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,200
- Her name is...
- Kim Yumi.

664
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,810
Yes. Here it is.

665
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,990
- Thank you.
- No problem.

666
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,620
The taxi is here.

667
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,090
Go ahead.

668
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,730
Let's ride together. I'll drop you home and then go.

669
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,750
There's no need. You're already late.

670
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,020
Go quickly. I can just take the bus.

671
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,350
Go quickly.

672
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,470
I-I'll call you.

673
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,110
♫ We know ♫

674
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,420
Today's date is over, Naughty.

675
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,670
Get some sleep now.

676
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,610
They could have kissed.

677
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,240
He's calmed down now.

678
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,570
The house is too dangerous. He almost went out of control!

679
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:44,550
Let's not bring her home again.

680
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,760
♫ I feel I am changing ♫

681
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,970
♫  For us, now even the small things ♫

682
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,870
It worked!

683
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,650
Did it?

684
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,050
I think so.

685
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,480
It's done!

686
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,480
Good job, Wung!

687
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,730
Wung, if it weren't for you ... Seriously, we almost lost everything!

688
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,880
What time is it?

689
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,560
You must be hungry. Let's go out! Let's eat something really good today, okay?

690
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,960
I have to go, you two just eat together!

691
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,130
Why? Aren't you hungry?

692
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,010
- I'm not hungry.
- He came here in the middle of a date.

693
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,630
- Go ahead, CEO.
- I'll get going.

694
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:33,770
- See you on Monday.
- Good job.

695
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:37,600
What did I do wrong? Yes, it's all been revealed anyway.

696
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,900
Yes, I'm going to say something to Comedy Big League*.
(Korean comedy show)

697
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,120
Jang Do Yeon, this dance.

698
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,280
- This will be broadcasted, right?
- Yes.

699
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,160
But why isn't what I did broadcasted?

700
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,780
Why can't it?

701
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,180
Gu Wung

702
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,130
Hello?

703
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,690
Yes, I'm home. Are you done?

704
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:02,600
I just finished and came home now. I'll bring you your dress.

705
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,210
Oh, no, it's fine. Give it to me next time.

706
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,710
I'll stop by now.

707
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,730
Give it to me next time we see each other. You must be tired now.

708
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,100
But I would like to stop by now.

709
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,720
Can't I come to see you now?

710
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,990
All right. Come by.

711
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,510
I'll contact you when I arrive.

712
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:42,970
There's something weird about Yumi's behavior.

713
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:46,880
She left her clothes at the clothing store.

714
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,960
That clothing store is only a 3-minute walk away from where the coffee was spilled.

715
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,700
It was closer than Wung's house which is a 5-minute walk away.

716
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,700
Yet, she came to our home and changed into Wung's clothes.

717
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,610
Why?

718
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,770
I'm in front of your house.

719
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,950
Why are you so late?

720
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,100
I wanted to iron it before coming.

721
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,310
You didn't have to iron it.

722
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,870
Have you had dinner?

723
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,000
No, not yet.

724
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,200
Oh, really? Let's go eat then. I'll pay!

725
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,110
But...

726
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,570
why did you come to my place when you had clothes?

727
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,590
Sorry?

728
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,970
The clothing store was closer than my place.

729
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,690
I ...

730
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,630
didn't think of that.

731
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,700
You didn't think of that?

732
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,620
That's right, because I was flustered.

733
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:35,850
I remembered later that I had bought clothes.

734
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,870
Oh, really?

735
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,350
Then what else could it be?

736
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:46,260
I don't know what it could be, that's why I'm asking.

737
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,510
I told you I didn't think of that.

738
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,350
All right.

739
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,700
Why are you laughing?

740
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,720
Because you're cute.

741
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:04,560
You're ridiculous. You always say I'm cute.

742
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,140
What do you feel like eating? This area is famous for ...

743
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,690
kimchijjim* ...

There's something I really want to do with you.

765
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,960
I don't know whether you will like it or not.

766
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,470
- Then let's go to my place.
- What?

767
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:26,170
Naughty, don't get too ahead of yourself.

768
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:30,060
This is really good. Who made this?

769
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,490
A man and a woman can't be just friends!

770
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,970
Because ... they just can't!

771
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,830
Is this Sae Yi? She is pretty.

772
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:40,340
I have to stop by the office, do you want to go with me after eating this?

773
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,080
But how do you know my name?
