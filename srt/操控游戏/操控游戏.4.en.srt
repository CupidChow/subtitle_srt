were to get hurt on the racetrack,

and one of our drivers gets killed,
how would we recover from that?

Seems I've been focusing
on all the wrong things.

169
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,809
Now I've finally found the real deal.

170
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,519
I'm glad to hear that.

171
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,020
May I ask what it is?

00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,199
That's exactly what I would expect
from you.

177
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,953
Which means I need a list of clients
connected to the Ministry of Justice.

178
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,501
I'll get the list
and bring in a foreign security agency.

181
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,734
[indistinct radio chatter]

182
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,364
Hey, open the door. Now!

183
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,831
What about the study?

184
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,166
Did they seize everything?

185
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,584
[man on phone] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

186
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,169
Oh, son of a bitch!

187
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,298
Just hole up somewhere.
Keep this to yourself.

188
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,925
<i>-Understood.</i>
-I'm hanging up.

189
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,010
Warden, it's the--

190
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,970
-Ah, just tell me later.
-No, he's already later.

191
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,972
No, I think we'll talk right now.

192
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,267
-[gasping] Commissioner.
-You look like you're falling apart.

193
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,437
-Is this job too much for you?
-To what do I owe this surprise visit?

194
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,647
All of you...

195
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,856
get out!

196
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,399
-You, have a seat.
-Yes, sir.

197
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
Hey.

198
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,697
Hey. What are you doing?

199
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,493
Wow. Did you get these awards
just for housing all those prisoners?

200
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,121
-[chuckles] Yes, that's right.
-That's admirable.

201
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,165
I thought they were just
a drain on our taxes.

202
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,751
-Who...
-Oh, this is--

203
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,795
Why don't you go and drink some coffee?

204
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,838
Uh, yes. I'll come back later.

205
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,760
Listen to me. Whatever this gentleman
orders you to do, don't argue with it.

206
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,970
Just do it.

207
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,513
-What?
-I'll go now.

208
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,391
KOREA CORRECTIONAL SERVICE
GUAN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

209
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,143
I heard you have the most
violent criminals in the country here.

210
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,062
-Yes, but who are you?
-[door closes]

211
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,570
Who do you think I am?

212
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,365
[clears throat] I beg your pardon, sir,

213
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,119
but may I ask what your relationship is
with the commissioner?

214
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,954
Oh, none at all.

215
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,080
I don't really know him.

216
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,707
[scoffs] What do you mean by that?

217
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,417
I don't know the Commissioner General,

218
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,586
but I'm friends with the person
who got him appointed.

219
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,254
I have many friends, you know.

220
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,589
Ah, I see.

221
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,967
So, what brings you here?

222
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,263
Well, is this awkward for you, having to
show respect to someone younger like me?

223
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,223
Remember what the commissioner told you.

224
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,018
[sighs] To take care of you
during your visit.

225
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,103
That wasn't it.

226
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,734
The commissioner told me
I should agree to anything you ask.

227
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,152
That's not what he said.

228
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,491
He said to do
whatever you ordered me to do.

229
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,327
[chuckles softly]

230
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,418
Take a look at this.

231
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,551
PROPOSAL FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES

232
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,845
Doesn't it sound like a fun idea?

233
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,222
-Sure. However this is--
-Oh, I almost forgot.

234
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,892
-How should I say this?
-Here.

235
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,188
I didn't have time to wrap them.
I was in a hurry today.

236
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,232
And I don't like to waste time.

237
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,943
Each is worth 200 million,
if I had to guess,

238
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,863
I'll give you five more
if all this goes well.

239
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,158
[scoffs]

240
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,871
It seems like you've been working
really hard trying to get rich.

241
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,457
But you use public funds
to invest in crypto

242
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,251
and bought coins from a bunch
of scammers by mistake.

243
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,378
Right?

244
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,714
And you left all the money you pocketed
in your study.

245
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,091
So it was easy to take from you.

246
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,385
Who told you about that?

247
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:41,055
Didn't I already mention?
I have a lot of friends around.

248
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,724
As for the stuff they confiscated,

249
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,601
would you like them returned to you?

250
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,311
I can make it happen.

251
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,899
Or maybe, you care about
these inmates after all.

252
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,818
No, I don't get attached to the inmates.

253
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,152
Well, that's good to hear.

254
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,821
Then you've got nothing to lose.

255
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,202
This is an opportunity.

256
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,663
You can either agree to it
and become a very rich man,

257
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,457
or maybe you'll lose everything
and they'll fire you.

258
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,419
-[sighs]
-If you're out, tell me now.

259
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,629
I'll find someone
to take your place easily.

260
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,214
Oh, no, I can do it, sir.

261
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,343
Tell me what you want done.

262
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,265
[chuckles softly] Now we're talking.

263
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,227
You can authorize your inmates
for work outside the prison, right?

264
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,311
Yes, that's right.

265
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,815
Inmates should be selected
according to the conditions

266
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,608
listed on the last page of that file.

267
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,490
Violent offenders,
murderers, robbers, etcetera.

268
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,033
And if you're short on people,

269
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,369
anyone who pisses you off
will be just fine.

270
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,537
We'll take them.

271
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,956
The game gets interesting
when there's variety.

272
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,040
You got that?

273
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,543
Understand?

274
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,337
Yes, sir. I'll take care of everything.

275
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,673
I'll leave it to you

276
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,885
-Have a safe trip.
-[door closes]

277
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,344
[mouse clicking]

278

[indistinct chatter outside]

279
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,643
And grabs a change of clothes...

280
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,188
at 3:30.

281
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,566
[sighs]

282
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,113
B.

283
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,574
Zone B, huh?

284
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,579
[exhales sharply]

00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,126

[sighs]

292
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,383
Right out through the main gate.

293
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,177
[chuckles]

294
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,563
[Taejoong groans softly]

295
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,984
Oh, you're awake.

296
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,031
It's a good thing
that Father found you in time.

297
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,199
If he found you any later, you'd be dead.

298
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,826
[gagging]

299
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,832
[continues gagging]

300
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,042
Who made you eat it?

301
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,419
Or did you eat it on purpose?

302
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,171
What do you mean?

303
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,465
We found huge amounts of warfarin
in your blood.

304
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,926
-[groans]
-You swallowed rat poison.

305
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,636
You know that supplement you took?

306
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,347
All that Vitamin K3 acted as an antidote.

307
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,098
It bought you some extra time.

308
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,517
You should thank whoever got that for you.

309
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,853
-They ended up saving your life.
-[grunts]

310

Park Taejoong.

313
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,664
[retching]

314
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,583
You all right?

315
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,670
[sighs]

316
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,591
I heard a lot of stories...

317
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,137
that you went out the main gate
dressed in plain clothes.

318
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,139
Some are saying it was an escape attempt.

319
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,518
Others say you collapsed
after eating food mixed with rat poison.

320
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,353
Who knows what's true?

321
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,356
[Taejoong groaning]

322
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,608
I do know that something isn't adding up.

323
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,866
I don't think
you'd poison yourself like that.

324
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,744
Someone else did this.

325
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,914
They must have really wanted
to put you out of commission.

326
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,835
I should have kept
a closer watch on things.

327
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,170
I won't let this happen again,

328
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,922
I promise.

329
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,258
[grunts]

330
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,010
And another thing.

331
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,596
If those rumors are true,

332
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,184
that you changed clothes,
used the blind spots to reach the gate...

333
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:24,523
and even managed to get outside,
escaping does seem possible after all.

334
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,985
Nobody ever thinks of
just walking out the front door,

335
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,113
so I'm sure that's the weakest point here.

336
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,033
[grunts]

337
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,454
I treated you too humanely, 2802.

338
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,749
You think you're too humane?

339
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,962
Is that your idea of a joke?

340
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,757
Wow.

341
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,677
I'm really hurt to hear you say that.

342
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,139
You'd be surprised to hear
what people really think.

343
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,187
As soon as you recover,
the investigation will start.

344
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,939
Ah.

345
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,901
Noh Yongsik requested a visit.

346
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,027
Maybe some other time.

347
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,071
Please give him this message.

348
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,158
Thank you for saving my life again.

349
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,120
Is that some kind of secret code?

350
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,081
It's just a word of thanks.

351
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,208
Anyway...

352
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,962
out of everyone here,
you probably say thank you the most.

353
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,840
I guess that means...

354
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,635
you must have been a good man outside.

355
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,057
[retching]

356
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,102
You're telling me
Taejoong really said that?

357
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,604
Yes, that was it. Word for word.

358
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,942
He said,
"Thank you for saving my life again."

359
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,529
If that's some kind of secret code,
then I don't get it.

360
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,324
You don't know what it means either, huh?

361
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,867
Maybe it's not a code at all.

362
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,754
It was a jailbreak.

363
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,173
Jailbreak.

364
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,597
That asshole.

365
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,600
So that's why he said he was busy.

366
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,728
Yeah, I heard that the priest
brought him in from outside,

367
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,021
but the guards are keeping it quiet

368
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,898
because they're scared
of getting reprimanded.

369
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,108
He was passed out.

370
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,985
Apparently he ate rat poison.

371
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,236
Is that for real?

372
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,738
That's what they said
over at the infirmary.

373
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:37,990
So I bet it's true.

374
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,617
That asshole tried to escape
while he was dying?

375
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,952
[men chuckle]

376
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,913
Tell me, why the hell
would he poison himself?

377
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,833
I mean, that shit'll kill you, right?

378
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,960
My old dog ate it and dropped dead.

379
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,047
[all laughing]

380
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,220
This shithead is awfully clever, isn't he?

381
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,849
Right now, I'm sure he's up to something.

382
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,941
A few of our guys decided
to switch to Do Gangjae's side,

383
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,320
and I'll bet you it's because
of that shit-head Park Taejoong.

384
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,700
[banging on gate]

385
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,869
[guard] Quiet in there. No chatting.

386
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,625
Look at you.

387
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,503
If you aren't here to let me out, just go.

388
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,089
I'm in no mood for small talk right now.

389
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,801
I've heard what the other inmates
are saying.

390
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,180
The way you keep messing with inmate 2802,

391
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,435
makes you look like a scared dog
that's been backed into a corner. [laughs]

I'm gonna let you out now.

396

Just don't cause any trouble.

397
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,658
Got it?

398
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,035
[bangs on door] You understand me?

399
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,623

Is everything okay? I was looking for you.

410
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,018
I don't know anything about it.

411

What?

412
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,734
Hey, what are you talking about?

413

I'm not responsible for this.
So don't come at me later.

You guys, break it up now.

423
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,970
You're already in plain clothes.

424

all of you with obstruction?

Yeah, Go for it.
I'll be out of here soon anyway.

You little...

You seem out of breath.
Must be all that rat poison.

It's a shame you're this tired already.

431

I want you to send the inmates out
for community service.

538
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,181
Close it.

00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,398
[Yohan] Let me see. We've got 12 inmates.

540
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,824
Aggravated assault, threats,
severe injury.

541
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,159
That's a lot of convictions.

542
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,910
[scoffs] What a piece of work.

543
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,974
YEO DEOKSU

544
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,394
This mod boss still has
over seven years on his sentence.

545
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,313
RAPE WITHIN FAMILY RELATIONS

546
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,273
He even raped his own sister?

547
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,234
[laughing]

548
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,361

00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,656
[♪ "William Tell Overture"
playing over speakers]

554
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,237
[feedback whines loudly]

555
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,161
[over speakers] Did everyone sleep well?

556
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,037
Thank you for coming.

557
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,125
You must be wondering where you are
and why you're here.

558
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,877
Well, your time begins now.

559
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,338
[chuckles]
This is the land of opportunity.
