00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:20,922
You were out here?

4
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:25,718
There, there.

5
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>The virus that devastated Korea is
expected to finally come to an end.</i>

6
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,821
Soo-ah? Can I come in?

7
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:49,200
<i>The government announced the
state of emergency could be lifted.</i>

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,203
<i>With no new reported cases in 180 days,</i>

9
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:55,706
<i>citizens are rejoicing the
end of the virus infections.</i>

10
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,753
<i>It’s a relief to hear that
there are no more infectees.</i>

11
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:06,467
<i>But our hearts go out to
the victims and their families.</i>

12
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,843
Are you meditating?

13
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:10,304
<i>I hope they can return to normal…</i>

14
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:17,395
<i>It was really scary to see zombies
attacking people like in the movies.</i>

15
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:21,565
<i>I’m so relieved to hear that
there are no more zombies.</i>

16
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,861
You must be starving.

17
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:26,570
Guess what Daddy bought you?

18
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,297
<i>My daughter is a zombie.</i>

19
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,551
Stop it.

00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:53,556

22
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,110
Hello! I’m Tae-rang’s
uncle, Lee Jung-hwan!

23
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,946
I hope you’re all doing well.

24
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:10,573
I’ve been doing great!

25
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:13,076
Did you miss Tae-rang?

26
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:17,580
Let’s go meet Tae-rang now.

27
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,164
Come with me!

28
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:24,212
Tae-rang had two live chicken
for brunch and is waiting for you.

29
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:27,756
Finally, we’re here to meet Tae-rang!

30
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,094
Look! Tae-rang is coming down!

31
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:34,680
I’m teaching Tae-rang
how to dance these days.

32
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,226
A dancing tiger?
Sounds crazy, you think?

33
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:39,310
Watch carefully!

34
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,439
When people dance

35
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,692
like this

36
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,694
and like this,

37
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:49,863
Tae-rang does this!

38
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,114
Dance Tae-rang!

39
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,120
Show them what you can do.

40
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:00,539
Tae-rang, dance!

41
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,169
What’s with him?

42
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,634
Did you see that? Tae-rang danced!

43
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:14,470
Like this, this, this…

44
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,973
Tae-rang dances like this!

45
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,854
That was Tae-rang, the
amazing dancing tiger!

Yup!

65
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,626
You said it was Michael Jackson.
Then why’d you quit dancing?

66
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:31,339
I didn’t quit dancing.

67
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,632

68

78

122
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:07,578
stop buying churros for my birthday.

123
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,789
I don’t like them anymore.

124

What!

125
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:16,170
Remember when we almost got kicked
off the KTX when you were young?

126
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,465
They don’t sell churros on the train,
but you wanted them and had a fit.

127
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,925
I don’t remember! I don’t remember!

00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,953
Why don’t we pretend to be infected?

186
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:01,039
What? That’s crazy!

187
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,958
People act like zombies
and fool them in the movies.

188
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,793
That’s the movies!

189
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:10,464
And you know I’m shy. I can’t. No way!

190
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,743
That’s my girl!

191
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,374
Go! Go! Go!

192
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,716
Go!

193
00:13:58,512 --> 00:13:59,638
Go together!

194
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,806
Hurry up!

195
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,851
Go together!

196
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:07,939
Meowmeow!

197
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,249
They’re on to us. Run!

198
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:00,241
Dad!

199
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:06,039
Let’s go!

200
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:15,464
Hurry!

201
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:30,563
Soo-ah.

202
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,025
I’ll be right back with the
car. Stay and hide here.

203
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:36,360
What if you get bitten?

204
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,988
Don’t worry! I promise
to come back alive!

205
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:42,741
No! That’s a death flag!

206
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,368
People who say that
are the first to die!

207
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:45,119
Really?

208
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,329
Take it back now!

209
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:47,205
Okay.

210
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,582
I take it back!

211
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,335
I’ll be right back!

212
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:11,562
NO PARKING

213
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,969
Soo-ah! Get in!

214
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:47,974
Seatbelt.

215
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:56,983
Yes!

216
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:59,360
Bravo!

217
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,987
Way to go, Soo-ah!

218
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:04,740
What’s wrong?

219
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:08,494
Ah… It’s nothing.

220
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,418
- What is it?
- Stop!

221
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:17,962
Let me see.

222
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:28,222
What happened?

223
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:34,896
Ouch!

224
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:43,654
Who are you?

225
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:46,490
Zombie!

226
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:55,624
Dad...

227
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,045
Will I become a zombie too?

228
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,966
No! Don’t say that.

229
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,884
It’s just a little bite.
You’ll be fine.

230
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:08,721
Really? I’ll be fine, right?

231
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,264
Of course!

232
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:14,978
The doctors will treat you.
You’ll be fine. Don’t worry.

233
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:34,122
Soo-ah?

234
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:37,375
Don’t close your eyes! Open your eyes!

235
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,252
Soo-ah! No!

236
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:40,836
Can you hear me?

237
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:42,421
Soo-ah!

238
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:45,133
Soo-ah!

239
00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:53,849
Soo-ah!

240
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,611
Soo-ah? What’s with that look?

241
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,986
Jung-hwan? Are you here?

242
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:30,864
Am I seeing things because I’m drunk?

243
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:32,823
Mom! Where have you been?

244
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:35,201
I get off work around this time.

245
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:38,496
What brings you here?
Where’s my princess?

246
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:39,538
- Mom.
- What?

247
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:43,251
Soo-ah is sick.

248
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:45,419
What? What do you mean she’s sick?

249
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:47,964
Soo-ah!

250
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:50,884
Mom! No! Don’t go in
there. Listen to me first.

251
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,927
- Soo-ah is...
- What do you mean she’s sick?

252
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:54,762
- What I mean is...
- Let go!

253
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:56,430
Soo-ah!

254
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:03,354
Oh! My sweet little baby. Do
you want something to eat?

255
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:18,870
Why, you little brat!

256
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:22,623
You turned Granny’s room upside down!

257
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:26,169
How dare you!

258
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:29,380
Don’t give me that look!

259
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:32,425
Mom!

260
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,011
Mom!

261
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,744
Where are your damn manners!

262
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:05,583
Oh, no! My poor princess!

263
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,087
How can this happen on her birthday?

264
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,089
You just called her a brat.

265
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:13,132
When did I call her a brat?

266
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,474
Granny is so sorry!
My poor little princess!

267
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,683
I’m sorry!

268
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:25,644
I didn’t do it on purpose.
It was just human instincts.

269
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,021
Quiet, Mom.

270
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,775
<i>It is difficult to control.</i>

271
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:36,072
<i>However, the government
is working with the military</i>

272
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:38,324
<i>to deploy specialized units</i>

273
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:42,536
<i>and stop the spread of the virus.</i>

274
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:49,252
<i>The public is urged to avoid
contact with any infectees.</i>

275
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:53,797
<i>The government is also trying to
prevent the spread to other areas...</i>

276
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:58,344
HOSPITAL

277
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,652
Ma’am! Back away from the infectee!

278
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:16,112
No!

279
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:19,282
My son is fine! He’s just scared!

280
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:20,199
Move!

281
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:24,828
Step aside from the infectee.

282
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:28,791
We have orders to stop contact with
infectees and kill them if needed.

283
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,126
What do you mean?

284
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:32,753
My son is not infected!

285
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:57,320
<i>An unidentified virus has
claimed the lives of many people.</i>

286
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,738
<i>The infected are the walking dead.</i>

287
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,699
<i>They are no longer human.</i>

288
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:03,201
<i>The government is
inevitably forced to...</i>

289
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:06,204
What in the world is happening?

290
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:15,004
Even my granddaughter...
became a zombie.

291
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:20,509
Not zoomies, zombie!

292
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:26,140
Not donkey! Zombie!

293
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:29,685
Your cheap hearing aid...

294
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:31,812
Mom.

295
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:36,067
Don’t tell anyone what
happened to Soo-ah.

296
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:38,777
Okay, fine.

297
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,906
But shouldn’t we report it?

298
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:46,870
<i>It’s obvious we will end
up in a bigger crisis.</i>

299
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,914
<i>Harboring infectees is a
serious, criminal offence.</i>

300
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:51,457
CALL 1339 TO REPORT INFECTEES

301
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:54,543
<i>If you are with an
infectee or discover one,</i>

302
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,963
<i>call 1339 immediately to...</i>

303
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:58,422
Jung-hwan.

304
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:03,302
I don’t think this is right.

305
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,845
You know what happens if we report her?

306
00:25:09,683 --> 00:25:10,894
They’ll kill her!

307
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,022
They’ll shoot her to death!

308
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,816
I’d rather do it myself.

309
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:31,289
Soo-ah, I’m sorry.

310
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:36,460
Daddy is so sorry.

311
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,510
Dad!

312
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:45,970
Dad?

313
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,096
Dad!

314
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,731
Stop, Jung-hwan!

315
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:19,712
I’m so sorry.

316
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,591
Daddy is so sorry.

317
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:50,284
Let’s just die together.

318
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:56,540
Why hit me?

319
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,791
Crazy fool!

320
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:58,209
Move!

321
00:26:59,085 --> 00:26:59,961
I’ll do it.

322
00:27:06,384 --> 00:27:07,843
Mom.

323
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,971
No! Mom! Mom!

324
00:27:09,971 --> 00:27:11,973
Wait! Stop!

325
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:12,974
Move!

326
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:17,228
I know what it feels
like to lose a child!

327
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:19,647
If you can’t do it, I will!

328
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:21,399
Mom! Wait! Stop!

329
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:25,069
Mom! Listen to me.
You’re not being rational!

330
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:28,322
I’m always rational! I got
a T for my MBTI test.

331
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:29,991
Really? When did you get tested?

332
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:31,951
I don’t have time to go to a hospital.

333
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,954
It’s not a medical test. You
can test it on your phone.

334
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:36,873
Think I’m stupid? Damn it!

335
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:38,917
- Give me the shovel.
- Let go!

336
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,085
Give it to me!

337
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,671
- Come on!
- It’s my shovel!

338
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:51,971
Where is she?

339
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:54,182
Soo-ah?

340
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:06,110
Maybe she went that way!

341
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:11,199
Oh, no! This is bad!
What if we can’t find her?

342
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,200
Golly.

343
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,080
Mom. Do you think Soo-ah went there?

344
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:24,420
Why would she come here?

345
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,813
Soo-ah?

346
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:50,821
I get it now.

347
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,116
Soo-ah is alive.

348
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:54,617
What?

349
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:59,455
She loved playing here with
you when she was young.

350
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:01,207
Without memories, how
could she come here?

351
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,293
Maybe she just came by chance.

352
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:07,380
Since you hit her with that stick,
she flinches when she sees you!

353
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:11,675
Soo-ah is still alive!

354
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:13,677
Come to your senses!

355
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:15,679
They said on TV that they’re all dead.

356
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,680
Hold on.

357
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:47,711
Huh?

358
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:52,133
Isn’t this the title track
to BoA’s second album?

359
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:56,930
Why play that?

360
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,892
Turn it off!

361
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:01,976
Hold on.

362
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:15,239
Look, Mom!

363
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:20,411
Can a zombie dance to BoA’s song?

364
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:23,414
Soo-ah practiced this every
day for her dance competition.

365
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:36,344
If she remembers, she’s
not a zombie. She’s alive!

366
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:38,596
Soo-ah is definitely alive!

367
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,063
That’s it.

368
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,898
Next?

369
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:51,860
Turn!

370
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,571
Mom! She’s alive.

371
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:23,182
See? I’m right!

372
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:26,227
If memories are restored,
the virus gets weaker.

373
00:31:26,227 --> 00:31:27,561
Forget all that.

374
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:31,482
If she’s my granddaughter,
she’ll eat my egg-rice.

375
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:37,321
If she eats it, she’s my princess.
If she doesn’t, she’s a zombie.

376
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:42,076
Here’s your favorite!
Granny’s egg-rice.

377
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:52,628
See? It’s hopeless.

378
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:21,824
She loves beef tripe just like me!

379
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:24,035
See? She takes after you.

380
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:27,121
If she has memories?

381
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:28,456
- She’s not a zombie.
- Right.

382
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:31,960
Ma’am!

383
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,008
Dong-bae’s here!

384
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,302
Hi.

385
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:45,473
Hey, Jung-hwan! I saw you earlier.

386
00:32:46,224 --> 00:32:48,726
Why didn’t you call me when
you came down, man?

387
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:52,313
I came late last night. I lost track.

388
00:32:52,313 --> 00:32:53,689
Hey, wait.

389
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:56,109
I heard all hell broke loose in Seoul!

390
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,528
The zombies have white
eyes, like in the movies,

391
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:02,490
with the veins and tendency to bite!

392
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,491
Are you okay, man?

393
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:07,078
I’m fine or else I wouldn’t be here!

394
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:09,247
Great! I’m glad you came.

395
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,624
There are no zombies
here in this quiet village.

396
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,542
Right.

397
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,962
By the way, where’s Soo-ah?

398
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,296
- Sleeping.
- In Seoul, sleeping...

399
00:33:18,422 --> 00:33:19,465
There she is!

400
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:20,299
Soo-ah!

401
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:23,552
Uncle Dong-bae is here!

402
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:37,316
Whoa, Soo-ah changed a bit.

403
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,484
She grew a lot.

404
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,402
Thanks to puberty.

405
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:42,613
Right, puberty can make her change.

406
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:44,407
Kids change dozens of times.

407
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:46,284
- We did that too!
- Right.

408
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:48,077
Maybe not that much...

409
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:52,248
I got a phone call. Hold on.

410
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:53,249
I’ll be back.

411
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,509
To report, it’s 13...?

412
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:04,677
What are you doing?

413
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:10,433
Dong-bae.

414
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:12,476
That’s my daughter Soo-ah.

415
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:15,354
Right. I know Soo-ah.

416
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,816
But she became a zombie.

417
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,864
Don’t call her a zombie!

418
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:27,200
Soo-ah is alive and has memories!

419
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,701
She can dance like BoA.

420
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:29,827
That’s right!

421
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:32,997
She eats beef tripe well just like me!

422
00:34:32,997 --> 00:34:33,622
Yes!

423
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:35,583
Zombies don’t eat tripe!

424
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:43,424
What’s this?

425
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:45,718
How is this dancing?

426
00:34:45,718 --> 00:34:47,845
The way I see it, this
is Train to Busan.

427
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,100
No!

428
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:54,643
BoA’s “No.1”

429
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:59,190
is stimulating her brain
to restore memory cells.

430
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,944
Dr. Sushant said if memories
return, the virus weakens.

431
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:03,862
Fine.

432
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:08,116
Let’s say that the theory is right.
What are you trying to get at?

433
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:10,493
What if

434
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:15,498
we can restore Soo-ah’s memory
to stop the virus from progressing?

435
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:18,792
Maybe we can train her?

436
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,294
Memory recovery training?

437
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:22,922
How can you train a zombie?

438
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:26,592
When Tae-rang first came
to the zoo, he was so fierce.

439
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,303
Everyone said to send him back!

440
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:33,432
But not me! I said I
won’t give up on him!

441
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:35,684
I trained him to the end!

442
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:40,106
How do you think he is now?

443
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:45,987
He can even dance, pal!

444
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:47,196
Look, Jung-hwan.

445
00:35:47,196 --> 00:35:50,199
Tigers and zombies are not the same!

446
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:55,454
What if Soo-ah bites your mom?

447
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,831
What about all the
people of Eunbong-ri?

448
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:00,543
Give it up.

449
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:03,754
Citizens must follow the
government’s guidelines!

450
00:36:11,095 --> 00:36:15,934
What parent gives up on his own kid?

451
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:18,061
Can you give up on your kid?

452
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:22,440
I never got married. I don’t have kids.

453
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:31,532
Hold still!

454
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,910
There’s chili paste all over your hair.

455
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,661
What a mess!

456
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:38,206
Oh, my...

457
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:42,501
Poor princess. It must hurt so much.

458
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:47,423
I wish I could’ve caught
it instead of you...

459
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,426
Damn twerp.

460
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:52,220
How dare you growl!

461
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,013
I’ll hit you, if I have to!

462
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:22,791
After I fed and washed her,
she calmed down a lot.

463
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:24,961
What did Dong-bae say?

464
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:29,715
He said to leave in the morning.

465
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:57,743
I’m leaving now! Happy?

466
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:02,916
What about Jin-gu?

467
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:07,962
He works for the biggest
pharmaceutical company in the U.S.

468
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:10,256
After you left, I called
and asked him about

469
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:11,382
a treatment.

470
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,636
They’re done with animal testing.

471
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:20,892
They’re applying for
emergency approval soon!

472
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:21,893
Really?

473
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:27,565
He said to buy stocks. Dang lots!

474
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,651
Look, pal.

475
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:33,947
I’ll help you train Soo-ah.

476
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:36,365
No way.

477
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:38,117
I can’t put you in danger too.

478
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:39,994
What are friends for?

479
00:38:39,994 --> 00:38:42,371
I gotta be there to make
sure you don’t get bitten.

480
00:38:43,873 --> 00:38:46,584
But it’s only until the
treatment comes out.

481
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:48,836
Okay?

482
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:52,006
Thanks.

483
00:38:53,257 --> 00:38:54,508
Thanks a lot, man!

484
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,780
Soo-ah, let’s train to not bite.

485
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,907
You can’t bite this.

486
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:20,409
This is for shaking hands.

487
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:21,535
Shake hands.

488
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:24,998
- No! Soo-ah! No!
- Don’t yell!

489
00:39:24,998 --> 00:39:26,958
Loud noises will arouse her more.

490
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:29,793
Stay back!

491
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:32,838
Oh, no!

492
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:35,716
What now?

493
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,719
Dong-bae!

494
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,889
Don’t show your back!

495
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:44,017
If you do, it’s over!

496
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:46,978
Hey, zombie.

497
00:39:46,978 --> 00:39:48,271
What are you gonna do?

498
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:50,231
Will you bite me?

499
00:39:54,652 --> 00:39:57,030
Soo-ah! No!

500
00:39:58,614 --> 00:39:59,782
Golly!

501
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:02,660
Now let’s do social training.

502
00:40:04,787 --> 00:40:08,124
This means you like
it. Like a cat kiss.

503
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:11,460
Here.

504
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:17,300
Saw that, Mom? Soo-ah
gave me the cat kiss!

505
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,052
How is that a cat kiss?

506
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:22,013
It’s a look that says you’re her meat.

507
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:35,109
Well done.

508
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:43,701
Regaining memory training!

509
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,539
Exercise is best to
restore your memory.

510
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:51,209
You used to do this every
day in elementary school.

511
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:52,793
Warm-up routine.

512
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:56,547
Twirl your neck!

513
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:04,513
Dong-bae!

514
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,857
<i>She responded well to
the warm-up routine.</i>

515
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:15,984
Good girl.

516
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,616
<i>She doesn’t bite if she’s full.</i>

517
00:41:24,158 --> 00:41:25,118
REPORTED NATIONWIDE WEEKLY INFECTIONS

518
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:27,661
<i>Meanwhile, the number of
infectees hit an all-time low.</i>

519
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:29,538
<i>The government raised the reward
for reporting infectees to $100,000.</i>

520
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:30,915
$100,000 REWARD FOR REPORTING INFECTEES

521
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:35,128
What happened?

522
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:38,547
- Damn cat!
- Turn the news back on.

523
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:03,406
Soo-ah! You’re doing great!

524
00:42:06,117 --> 00:42:07,201
Way to go!

525
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:33,895
No, Soo-ah!

526
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:19,690
Well done.

527
00:43:21,734 --> 00:43:23,027
Soo-ah? Say hi.

528
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,489
That’s it.

529
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:33,037
Now say, “Daddy.”

530
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:34,163
Daddy.

531
00:43:39,878 --> 00:43:41,129
Daddy.

532
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:46,968
It’d be perfect, if
only you could talk.

533
00:43:46,968 --> 00:43:48,677
Don’t push too hard.

534
00:43:48,677 --> 00:43:53,141
If you say they’re pretty,
take care of them, and wait,

535
00:43:53,141 --> 00:43:55,351
they’ll grow and bloom flowers.

536
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:01,524
She eats well and is
so good these days.

537
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:03,609
Granny.

538
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:10,366
Granny.

539
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:17,165
Granmeow!

540
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:24,130
Wait and see.

541
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:28,301
She’ll say daddy and granny
and talk up a storm soon.

542
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:30,970
Jung-hwan! Come and see this.

543
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:31,845
<i>Hello!</i>

544
00:44:31,845 --> 00:44:34,515
<i>My granddaughter is not an infectee,</i>

545
00:44:34,515 --> 00:44:39,770
<i>but her veins are bulging on
her face and she growls.</i>

546
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:41,940
<i>Can you recommend some makeup for her?</i>

547
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,818
Why tell the whole world
that Soo-ah is infected?

548
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:49,280
I never told her that she’s infected!

549
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,825
Go into town and buy some makeup.

550
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:53,534
Makeup?

551
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:59,332
My little baby must feel so stuffy.

552
00:44:59,332 --> 00:45:03,878
She doesn’t try to bite now.
Let’s doll her up and take her out.

553
00:45:04,921 --> 00:45:06,005
BEAUTY WORLD

554
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:07,798
Golly!

555
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:10,718
What a darn sweet father!

556
00:45:10,718 --> 00:45:12,929
What is your daughter’s skin tone?

557
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:15,932
Milk tone like you?

558
00:45:15,932 --> 00:45:21,437
No, it’s a dark... uh, gray tone.

559
00:45:21,437 --> 00:45:24,148
Deep gray, huh?

560
00:45:24,148 --> 00:45:25,441
One moment, please.

561
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:30,113
Deep gray... Deep gray...

562
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:41,207
Ms. Shin!

563
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:44,627
Teacher!

564
00:45:44,627 --> 00:45:46,504
- Having tanghulu again?
- Yes.

565
00:45:46,504 --> 00:45:48,756
- She wanted some.
- Don’t eat them too often.

566
00:45:56,264 --> 00:45:58,807
Sir? Here you go.

567
00:46:00,351 --> 00:46:02,395
Do you want that too?

568
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:03,897
No, no...

569
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:04,981
Lee Jung-hwan!

570
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:12,113
Hi, Yeon-hwa.

571
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:19,078
I could’ve taken the bus.

572
00:46:19,078 --> 00:46:21,289
It’s on the way anyway.

573
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:23,041
We can catch up like this.

574
00:46:25,709 --> 00:46:27,503
That’s cute.

575
00:46:27,503 --> 00:46:29,838
I take kendo lessons.

576
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:31,715
It’s the best for mental training.

577
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:36,137
Did you move back here?

578
00:46:36,137 --> 00:46:40,308
You didn’t know? I teach
at Eunbong Middle School.

579
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:43,727
School is the same as
when we went there.

580
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:45,688
Why did you come here?

581
00:46:45,688 --> 00:46:49,901
Ah, well... Just because.

582
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:51,360
Living with your mom?

583
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,404
Yes, Mom, my cat, and...

584
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:58,201
My daughter.

585
00:46:58,201 --> 00:46:59,743
Daughter?

586
00:46:59,743 --> 00:47:01,620
You got married?

587
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,917
Wow, how old is she?

588
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:06,792
Fifteen.

589
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:08,711
Why didn’t you tell me!

590
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:10,880
What school does she go
to? Where’s your wife?

591
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,465
Can I come over to your place?

592
00:47:12,465 --> 00:47:14,758
- I love cats!
- No.

593
00:47:18,346 --> 00:47:20,806
- But...
- Could you let me off here?

594
00:47:20,806 --> 00:47:22,516
- Here?
- Yes.

595
00:47:22,516 --> 00:47:23,935
Your house is still far away.

596
00:47:23,935 --> 00:47:25,103
I want to walk.

597
00:47:25,937 --> 00:47:26,938
A lot.

598
00:47:39,575 --> 00:47:40,994
Sure you’ll be fine?

599
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:50,294
<i>Shin Yeon-hwa.</i>

600
00:47:50,294 --> 00:47:52,546
Your first crush is back.

601
00:47:52,546 --> 00:47:54,007
She’s not my first crush.

602
00:47:55,799 --> 00:47:57,385
She’s just a childhood friend.

603
00:47:57,385 --> 00:47:58,302
Here!

604
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,066
Jung-hwan.

605
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:15,278
I can’t stand this. I
gotta get it off my chest.

606
00:48:15,278 --> 00:48:17,571
I heard everything about
how you got divorced

607
00:48:17,571 --> 00:48:19,448
and your daughter receives
brain treatments.

608
00:48:19,448 --> 00:48:21,242
That’s why she’s not going to school.

609
00:48:23,827 --> 00:48:24,828
I’m sorry.

610
00:48:24,828 --> 00:48:26,539
I had no idea.

611
00:48:28,499 --> 00:48:31,878
So, I’ve been thinking.

612
00:48:31,878 --> 00:48:35,048
Why don’t you send your
daughter to our school?

613
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:39,010
There are only 3 student in her year.

614
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,970
I’ll take good care of her.

615
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:47,101
Thank you for the offer, but
I’m homeschooling Soo-ah.

616
00:48:47,685 --> 00:48:50,396
Homeschooling is nice.

617
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:51,564
But Jung-hwan,

618
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:55,401
it’s not good to just stay home.
She could get depressed.

619
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:57,028
I highly doubt that.

620
00:48:57,028 --> 00:48:58,112
Just eat.

621
00:48:58,779 --> 00:49:02,575
Here’s to Shin Yeon-hwa’s return!

622
00:49:02,575 --> 00:49:03,326
Cheers!

623
00:49:03,326 --> 00:49:06,079
<i>It’s been 200 days of

virus is in its final stages,</i>

<i>the government is set

626
00:49:13,586 --> 00:49:14,587
I detest zombies.

627
00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:22,095
The government calls them infectees,

628
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:25,848
but they’re just detestable
zombies in my eyes.

629
00:49:27,058 --> 00:49:28,935
But it’s an illness.

630
00:49:28,935 --> 00:49:31,855
They didn’t ask to catch it on purpose.

631
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:34,815
My fiancé got infected.

632
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:44,742
<i>Do you know what if feels
like to kill someone you love?</i>

633
00:49:46,535 --> 00:49:50,248
All I remember about him is
how he turned into a zombie.

634
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:53,292
For a while, I only reported
and killed zombies.

635
00:49:55,003 --> 00:49:56,880
It was the only way for me to move on.

636
00:50:04,178 --> 00:50:05,804

to kill around here?

I heard you met Yeon-hwa,
your first crush.

650
00:50:56,856 --> 00:50:59,483
Since when was she my first crush?

651
00:50:59,483 --> 00:51:04,363
Since she was young and came
over for tteokbokki every day.

652
00:51:04,363 --> 00:51:08,868
You used to say you’ll get married
and play under the blankets.

653
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:11,120
Close the door! It’s cold!

654
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,792

Soo-ah...

662
00:52:43,212 --> 00:52:45,798
You’re not gonna read it, are you?

663
00:52:47,258 --> 00:52:48,467
No way!

664
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,013
Who do you think I am?

665
00:52:59,437 --> 00:53:00,771
Dad.

666
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:01,772
What?

667
00:53:01,772 --> 00:53:04,358
It must be hard for you because of me.

668
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:05,818
I’m sorry.

669
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:10,031
No, it’s not hard for me at all.

670
00:53:10,031 --> 00:53:13,784
Daddy is fine. It must be hard on you.

671
00:53:15,703 --> 00:53:19,332
I’m trying, but it’s not easy.

672
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,294
Can you wait for me a bit longer?

673
00:53:24,128 --> 00:53:26,714
Of course, I’ll wait.

674
00:53:28,967 --> 00:53:30,426
I can wait for you.

675
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:39,102
Dad, I’m still practicing
dancing, but it’s so hard.

676
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:40,478
What’s dancing like me?

677
00:53:41,437 --> 00:53:45,149
Like Soo-ah? That’s easy.

678
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:50,654
Bright, cheerful, and
positive. Like this.

679
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:54,242
It’s a move that you can do best.

680
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:57,912
One, two, turn.

681
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,039
That’s it!

682
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,958
And one, two, three!

683
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,001
That’s right!

684
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:04,585
Then, one, two...

685
00:54:06,795 --> 00:54:07,713
Good!

686
00:54:07,713 --> 00:54:10,549
Then one, two, three, four!

687
00:54:14,053 --> 00:54:15,138
Soo-ah.

688
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:19,893
Soo-ah?

689
00:55:12,946 --> 00:55:13,863
No way!

690
00:55:13,863 --> 00:55:14,697
It’s dangerous.

691
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:18,451
It’s Soo-ah’s favorite place.

692
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:22,914
Her eyes glittered as she
watched the TV commercial.

693
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:23,831
Dong-bae.

694
00:55:24,832 --> 00:55:28,211
I know it’ll help Soo-ah
get her memory back.

695
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:30,379
What if something happens?

696
00:55:30,379 --> 00:55:32,298
Soo-ah’s never been
anywhere with lots of people.

697
00:55:32,298 --> 00:55:35,927
She doesn’t bite and understands
my words perfectly these days.

698
00:55:35,927 --> 00:55:37,803
And you and I will keep watch on her.

699
00:55:37,803 --> 00:55:39,597
Come on, man!

700
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:43,642
Where did he go?

701
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,311
Jeez!

702
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:49,773
Come with me, pal? Please?

703
00:55:51,192 --> 00:55:52,610
Mom!

704
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:03,537
Your mom’s tteokbokki is so
good! Just like the old days.

705
00:56:03,537 --> 00:56:07,458
Your cat is so cute too!
Chubby cats are the best!

706
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,878
- Oh, right.
- What’s your name?

707
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:11,504
Hold on.

708
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:15,049
- Mom, come here.
- Eat lots.

709
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:21,680
Are you nuts? How can you let her in?

710
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,018
It’s even weirder to not
let her in when she came.

711
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:27,645
Don’t worry. Soo-ah is sleeping.

712
00:56:38,364 --> 00:56:40,449
Oh, you must be Soo-ah.

713
00:56:45,746 --> 00:56:46,330
Jeez!

714
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:47,957
Go inside!

715
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,753
She gets sensitive around strangers.

716
00:56:52,753 --> 00:56:54,838
Oh, I’m sorry.

717
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:56,299
I didn’t mean to...

718
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:04,182
Wait.

719
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:06,600
That sound...

720
00:57:18,112 --> 00:57:18,821
What are you doing?

721
00:57:21,324 --> 00:57:23,117
Mom! Come on!

722
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:25,786
It’s time to exercise!
Reverse the aging clock!

723
00:57:26,245 --> 00:57:27,413
Suddenly?

724
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:30,166
Turn it back! Turn it back!

725
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:32,877
You want me to go?

726
00:57:32,877 --> 00:57:35,796
One, two! One, two!

727
00:57:35,796 --> 00:57:38,466
It’s sad to be old, you know?

728
00:57:39,758 --> 00:57:41,135
Wait! Hold on!

729
00:57:45,473 --> 00:57:47,766
What exactly is Soo-ah’s condition?

730
00:57:47,766 --> 00:57:49,393
Look, Yeon-hwa.

731
00:57:49,393 --> 00:57:52,480
Who says you can come at will?

732
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,482
Do you still like me or something?

733
00:57:56,275 --> 00:57:57,443
Jung-hwan.

734
00:57:57,443 --> 00:58:02,073
I’m sorry, but please stop coming here.

735
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:26,680
Stay still.

736
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:02,926
You’re Thor?

737
00:59:05,011 --> 00:59:06,095
What?

738
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,307
If you dress up, there’s
a 30% discount, right?

739
00:59:12,518 --> 00:59:13,978
Tada!

740
00:59:29,911 --> 00:59:31,037
Soo-ah...

741
00:59:31,037 --> 00:59:34,665
I referred to Sunmi’s
style in her 3rd album.

742
00:59:35,124 --> 00:59:38,086
But that’s not cosplay.
She looks like a normal girl.

743
00:59:38,086 --> 00:59:39,628
Soo-ah is a normal girl!

744
00:59:39,628 --> 00:59:40,588
There.

745
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:44,968
Thor? Are you nuts?

746
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:47,011
I can use this.

747
00:59:47,011 --> 00:59:48,471
- Mom!
- Hmm?

748
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:49,973
What are the two things you promised?

749
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:52,934
Don’t get drunk and
don’t meet Yeon-hwa.

750
00:59:53,517 --> 00:59:54,894
Go on.

751
00:59:54,894 --> 00:59:55,561
Okay.

752
00:59:55,561 --> 00:59:57,605
- I’ll give you this later.
- Okay.

753
00:59:57,605 --> 00:59:59,315
Let’s go!

754
00:59:59,315 --> 01:00:00,649
- See you later.
- Bye.

755
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,616
<i>Hello! It’s the village chief!</i>

756
01:00:08,616 --> 01:00:13,872
<i>There’s a meeting today at 4
o’clock at the Healing Center.</i>

757
01:00:13,872 --> 01:00:16,165
<i>I hope to see you all there!</i>

758
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:21,129
For 10 years straight, Eunbong-ri
won the Best Village to Live Award,

759
01:00:21,129 --> 01:00:24,715
the Crimeless Village
Award for 30 years,

760
01:00:24,715 --> 01:00:28,427
then received another
proud, new award this year.

761
01:00:33,807 --> 01:00:35,018
VILLAGE WITHOUT INFECTEES

762
01:00:35,018 --> 01:00:37,896
Village without infectees!

763
01:00:43,817 --> 01:00:48,531
The fact that there’s not a
single zombie found here is...

764
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:52,576
Are you okay, Bam-soon?

765
01:00:55,413 --> 01:00:59,375
I heard from Ms. Shin that your
granddaughter moved here?

766
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:02,045
Yes, that’s right.

767
01:01:02,045 --> 01:01:06,674
She’s the same age as my grandson.
Why not send her to school?

768
01:01:06,674 --> 01:01:09,635
Well, my baby is quite sick.

769
01:01:09,635 --> 01:01:10,469
What do you mean she’s sick?

770
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:12,221
She became a zombie.

771
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,725
Got dementia or something?

772
01:01:16,725 --> 01:01:18,019
I said zoomies!

773
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:21,564
Come on, Bam-soon! I’m disappointed.

774
01:01:21,564 --> 01:01:24,067
Eunbong Middle School,
with 40 years of tradition,

775
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:26,652
could close down with no new students.

776
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:29,363
How can you not send her
there because of zoomies?

777
01:01:29,363 --> 01:01:30,364
Right, Ms. Shin?

778
01:01:30,364 --> 01:01:33,159
Yes, she should go to school.

779
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:34,493
Of course, she should.

780
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:43,586
My baby is being homeschooled.
Don’t worry!

781
01:01:43,586 --> 01:01:45,880
I’m leaving.

782
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,381
Don’t leave now!

783
01:01:50,093 --> 01:01:51,177
Wait!

784
01:01:57,475 --> 01:02:00,311
We gotta get down to business.
Where do you think you’re going?

785
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:08,527
EUNBONG-RI UNITY PARTY!

786
01:02:09,988 --> 01:02:11,822

01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:32,778
See this?

809
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:35,739
We came here last year too.

810
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:39,785
I brought this from home.
We came two years ago too!

811
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:54,217
Hey, Jung-hwan!

812
01:03:54,217 --> 01:03:56,469
Jung-hwan! Take a look at this!

813
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:57,553
What?

814
01:03:57,553 --> 01:03:58,554
Come quick!

815
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:05,061
GAR VIRUS TREATMENT NEARS APPLICATION
OR EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION

816
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:09,148
If they’re applying for authorization,
it means it’ll be out soon?

817
01:04:09,148 --> 01:04:10,524
That’s right!

818
01:04:12,443 --> 01:04:14,237
Congratulations, man!

819
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:21,744
Dong-bae! Yes!

820
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,002
Wait a minute.

821
01:04:29,002 --> 01:04:32,171
Why are you so happy?

822
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:35,925
Did you buy the stocks?

823
01:04:37,176 --> 01:04:38,177
Of course!

824
01:04:42,098 --> 01:04:43,432
Way to go!

825
01:04:44,142 --> 01:04:44,976
Soo-ah!

826
01:04:47,603 --> 01:04:48,479

What did that cat eat?

831
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:26,059
What are you doing in my house?

832
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,061
Why didn’t you tell me?

833
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:29,312
What?

834
01:05:29,312 --> 01:05:31,689
If you don’t leave,
I’ll call the police!

835
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:34,859
But you won’t report a zombie?

836
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:52,626
That’s it! Keep playing.

837
01:05:52,626 --> 01:05:56,672
They’re attacking now.

838
01:05:56,672 --> 01:05:57,548
The guns...

839
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,176
Oh, no! I’m sorry.

840
01:06:00,176 --> 01:06:01,344
Are you okay?

841
01:06:29,788 --> 01:06:31,290
Hello.

842
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,084
What would you like? A corn dog?

843
01:06:35,503 --> 01:06:36,670
Churros?

844
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,006
Oh! Good choice!

845
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,426
Here! $5, please!

846
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:45,388
Hey! Wait!

847
01:06:50,226 --> 01:06:51,144
Soo-ah!

848
01:06:52,145 --> 01:06:53,437
Soo-ah!

849
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,234
You were here?

850
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,363
I’m sorry! I got too carried away!

851
01:07:02,363 --> 01:07:03,781
It’s okay if your memory
doesn’t come back.

852
01:07:03,781 --> 01:07:04,490
Mister!

853
01:07:05,283 --> 01:07:07,618
She didn’t pay yet.

854
01:07:08,077 --> 01:07:09,453
Oh, how much is it?

855
01:07:10,371 --> 01:07:11,830
Chu... rros.

856
01:07:15,209 --> 01:07:16,169
What?

857
01:07:18,922 --> 01:07:20,381
Churros.

858
01:07:23,717 --> 01:07:25,344
Churros.

859
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:27,263
Dong-bae! Did you hear that?

860
01:07:27,263 --> 01:07:30,558
Yes! She said it perfectly!

861
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:33,144
You heard too, right?

862
01:07:33,144 --> 01:07:35,396
You heard her say churros, right?

863
01:07:35,396 --> 01:07:38,357
Yes, she said, “Churros.”

864
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:46,615
Right Soo-ah! It’s churros.

865
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:52,163
Good job!

866
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:11,474
- Mister.
- Yes?

867
01:08:11,474 --> 01:08:14,602
Give me all the churros here!

868
01:08:15,769 --> 01:08:18,689
How could you hide
a zombie all this time?

869
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:20,483
Don’t call her a zombie.

870
01:08:21,192 --> 01:08:23,236
What about Soo-ah’s mom?

871
01:08:23,236 --> 01:08:25,696
Does she know that Soo-ah is a zombie?

872
01:08:27,073 --> 01:08:29,117
Of course not.

873
01:08:29,117 --> 01:08:30,743
My daughter is dead.

874
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:37,750
Soo-ah’s mom is your daughter?

875
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:38,960
What about Jung-hwan?

876
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,753
Jung-hwan is my kid too.

877
01:08:42,671 --> 01:08:49,470
What? You mean your daughter
and son got married?

878
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,555
No, they didn’t get married.

879
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:57,854
What? This is crazy.

880
01:09:00,148 --> 01:09:02,775
Hello? Infectee reporting center?

881
01:09:02,775 --> 01:09:03,985
I’m calling from Eunbong-ri...

882
01:09:03,985 --> 01:09:05,319
Stop!

883
01:09:07,696 --> 01:09:11,075
Soo-ah is Jung-hye’s daughter!

884
01:09:11,075 --> 01:09:14,828
Jung-hwan is not Soo-ah’s real dad.

885
01:09:14,828 --> 01:09:15,704
What?

886
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:22,295
Where the hell is it?

887
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:25,756
It’s okay.

888
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:30,261
Jung-hwan, long time no see!

889
01:09:30,929 --> 01:09:32,138
Get out now.

890
01:09:32,138 --> 01:09:34,640
Not until you give me my
money. Where’s my money?

891
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,100
How is that your money?

892
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,602
I saved that money for Soo-ah!

893
01:09:38,602 --> 01:09:39,312
You suddenly got brave?

894
01:09:39,312 --> 01:09:44,192
<i>That damn bastard always
made Jung-hye’s blood boil.</i>

895
01:09:44,192 --> 01:09:50,114
<i>Jung-hwan went to Seoul to
work and help with Soo-ah.</i>

896
01:09:51,908 --> 01:09:56,495
<i>Soo-ah was so happy to see
Jung-hwan ever since she was a baby.</i>

897
01:09:56,495 --> 01:09:57,872
My sister isn’t back yet.

898
01:09:57,872 --> 01:09:59,582
<i>Will you spend your birthday alone?</i>

899
01:09:59,582 --> 01:10:02,251
We all came up to see you.

900
01:10:04,837 --> 01:10:06,464
Shin Yeon-hwa is here too.

901
01:10:07,131 --> 01:10:07,840
Really?

902
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,301
<i>You said Jung-hye is coming
in 30 minutes anyway.</i>

903
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:11,177
Come quick!

904
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:15,514
<i>But it happened on Jung-hwan’s
birthday of all days.</i>

905
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,610
Way to go!

906
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:31,990
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

907
01:10:36,827 --> 01:10:38,997
Happy birthday, Lee Jung-hwan!

908
01:10:38,997 --> 01:10:40,039
Thanks.

909
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:41,415
Cheers!

910
01:10:42,959 --> 01:10:45,128
Man, we’re all twenty-four now!

911
01:10:45,794 --> 01:10:46,880
JUNG-HYE

912
01:10:49,215 --> 01:10:51,550
I gotta go. Sorry guys.

913
01:10:52,843 --> 01:10:54,803
Sorry, sis. I’m headed back now.

914
01:10:54,803 --> 01:10:56,347
I just went to blow out the candles.

915
01:10:56,847 --> 01:10:59,934
How could you leave Soo-ah home alone?

916
01:10:59,934 --> 01:11:00,977
<i>If you were so worried,</i>

917
01:11:00,977 --> 01:11:03,229
why didn’t you come sooner?

918
01:11:03,229 --> 01:11:04,397
<i>Look, Jung-hwan.</i>

919
01:11:04,397 --> 01:11:07,901
If you promised to watch Soo-ah,
you’re responsible till the end!

920
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:11,029
Let’s talk more at home.

921
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:16,784
Sis?

922
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:18,161
Hello?

923
01:11:18,827 --> 01:11:21,372
<i>Jung-hye? Sis!</i>

924
01:11:31,215 --> 01:11:32,258
Daddy!

925
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,261
Let’s play!

926
01:11:40,349 --> 01:11:41,893
Daddy...

927
01:11:43,561 --> 01:11:46,272
I’m so sorry, sis...

928
01:11:46,272 --> 01:11:48,107
<i>Jung-hwan decided then...</i>

929
01:11:48,107 --> 01:11:49,567
Don’t cry.

930
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:51,360
<i>To become Soo-ah’s father...</i>

931
01:11:53,237 --> 01:11:54,906
What about Soo-ah’s real dad?

932
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:01,412
He took Jung-hye’s life insurance money

933
01:12:01,412 --> 01:12:03,706
and left with his mistress.
You call that a dad?

934
01:12:03,706 --> 01:12:05,374
He’s not human.

935
01:12:09,712 --> 01:12:11,005
Go ahead and report it.

936
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:13,757
But report just me.

937
01:12:14,633 --> 01:12:16,635
Leave my kids alone.

938
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:18,888
You said it.

939
01:12:19,597 --> 01:12:21,849
Does your mom like churros too?

940
01:12:25,394 --> 01:12:26,229
What?

941
01:12:43,496 --> 01:12:45,456
Yeon-hwa? What are you doing?

942
01:12:45,456 --> 01:12:46,749
I’ll handle this.

943
01:12:46,749 --> 01:12:49,002
- But...
- Just go.

944
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:56,300
What are you trying
to do to my daughter?

945
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:00,346
Move! That’s not your daughter.

946
01:13:00,346 --> 01:13:01,222
It’s a zombie.

947
01:13:07,228 --> 01:13:08,396
Move, Jung-hwan!

948
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:10,273
Stop it!

949
01:13:15,153 --> 01:13:16,029
Soo-ah!

950
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:17,571
Stop!

951
01:13:21,825 --> 01:13:25,163
It’s okay. Don’t be scared.

952
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:30,334
It’s okay.

953
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:36,840
Did she just understand what you said?

954
01:13:39,718 --> 01:13:42,263
Soo-ah is different
from other infectees.

955
01:13:42,263 --> 01:13:43,806
She can think!

956
01:13:44,848 --> 01:13:49,687
If you attack Soo-ah again,
I swear I’ll get you.

957
01:13:50,396 --> 01:13:53,607
Yeon-hwa. Just drop it.

958
01:13:57,445 --> 01:13:58,237
No way.

959
01:13:59,238 --> 01:14:00,323
That’s a zombie!

960
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:02,992
It can’t think!

961
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:11,960
Yeon-hwa, let’s talk this through.

962
01:14:13,252 --> 01:14:14,170
Let go!

963
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:15,463
Stop, you two!

964
01:14:16,214 --> 01:14:18,091
We don’t have time for this.

965
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:19,926
We got something to discuss and plan!

966
01:14:21,385 --> 01:14:22,136
Let go!

967
01:14:24,138 --> 01:14:25,139
Are you crazy?

968
01:14:25,139 --> 01:14:29,727
He went on and on about
40 years of tradition.

969
01:14:29,727 --> 01:14:31,729
After 40 years of tradition,

970
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:39,028
Eunbong Middle School
can’t close before I die.

971
01:14:39,028 --> 01:14:40,238
Don’t you agree?

972
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:41,822
Of course.

973
01:14:41,822 --> 01:14:43,574
It can’t be shut down!

974
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,911
Damn alcohol!

975
01:14:47,996 --> 01:14:51,665
If we don’t send her, he’ll
come barging in tomorrow

976
01:14:51,665 --> 01:14:55,836
with folks from the school board.

977
01:14:55,836 --> 01:14:58,672
How can a zombie go to school?

978
01:14:58,672 --> 01:15:02,969
What if kids make fun of
her, then she bites them?

979
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:05,388
You said not to call her a zombie.

980
01:15:05,388 --> 01:15:08,016
Make up your mind. Damn it.

981
01:15:08,682 --> 01:15:10,143
You said she won’t bite.

982
01:15:10,977 --> 01:15:12,395
That’s right.

983
01:15:12,395 --> 01:15:14,730
Unless I tell her to,
Soo-ah will never bite.

984
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:16,732
Then you can send her to school.

985
01:15:20,694 --> 01:15:25,741
If she can think like you say,
then she can go to school.

986
01:15:25,741 --> 01:15:30,204
Prove that Soo-ah is different
by sending her to school.

987
01:15:30,204 --> 01:15:31,873
Then I’ll believe you.

988
01:15:31,873 --> 01:15:33,416
If not, I’ll report her now.

989
01:15:36,335 --> 01:15:37,128
Fine!

990
01:15:38,254 --> 01:15:40,339
She was fine at the amusement park.

991
01:15:40,339 --> 01:15:44,718
But if Soo-ah does well in school,

992
01:15:46,554 --> 01:15:48,472
don’t call her a zombie again.

993
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:54,187
Dear God, dear Buddha...

994
01:15:54,187 --> 01:15:58,107
Why choose today of all days
for her first day of school?

995
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:01,402
She’ll be fine.

996
01:16:01,402 --> 01:16:04,322
Who knows? Maybe she’ll
go and regain her memory.

997
01:16:04,322 --> 01:16:04,906
Right?

998
01:16:06,032 --> 01:16:06,866
You little twerp!

999
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:09,702
- Don’t do that!
- Soo-ah! No!

1000
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:15,249
LEE SOO-AH

1001
01:16:15,249 --> 01:16:19,587
Soo-ah was in a big accident.
She can’t talk fast and...

1002
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,216
She only remembers a few words.

1003
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:28,471
Even with the best of friends,
you must use precaution.

1004
01:16:28,471 --> 01:16:32,308
If she does anything
strange, please let me know.

1005
01:16:32,308 --> 01:16:33,601
Let’s give her a hand!

1006
01:16:43,444 --> 01:16:45,864
Ms. Shin! There’s someone outside!

1007
01:16:45,864 --> 01:16:46,655
Right.

1008
01:16:46,655 --> 01:16:47,698
Hold on.

1009
01:16:55,748 --> 01:16:56,540
What is it?

1010
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:59,168
Soo-ah gets cranky when she’s hungry.

1011
01:16:59,627 --> 01:17:01,795
These will help.

1012
01:17:03,547 --> 01:17:04,924
Hey, Seoul girl.

1013
01:17:07,843 --> 01:17:10,804
Girl, you’re wearing makeup?

1014
01:17:10,804 --> 01:17:13,975
- Do girls in Seoul all wear makeup?
- Yeah!

1015
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,980
Hey! I’m talking to you.

1016
01:17:20,106 --> 01:17:21,607
Hey!

1017
01:17:21,607 --> 01:17:23,234
Pull your bangs back.

1018
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:24,443
Let’s see.

1019
01:17:24,443 --> 01:17:25,319
Hold still!

1020
01:17:25,653 --> 01:17:27,655
- Stay still!
- Let’s see!

1021
01:17:32,743 --> 01:17:34,162
What’s the matter?

1022
01:17:35,872 --> 01:17:37,373
Golly!

1023
01:17:37,373 --> 01:17:39,042
What happened?

1024
01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:40,209
Holy golly!

1025
01:17:41,377 --> 01:17:44,130
How did this happen? Hold on.

1026
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:49,802
All done.

1027
01:17:57,685 --> 01:17:59,062
Hey! Pass the ball!

1028
01:17:59,062 --> 01:17:59,938
Dang.

1029
01:17:59,938 --> 01:18:01,689
It’s one on one. Why pass?

1030
01:18:05,526 --> 01:18:06,861
Move!

1031
01:18:11,908 --> 01:18:12,575
Now what?

1032
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:26,505
If you pass the ball,

1033
01:18:28,632 --> 01:18:30,051
I’d appreciate it.

1034
01:18:46,609 --> 01:18:50,279
She doesn’t get that I rule here!

1035
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:56,911
Ms. Shin! Let’s play 2 on 2!

1036
01:18:56,911 --> 01:18:59,830
Yoon-seo and me against
you and Seoul girl.

1037
01:19:01,165 --> 01:19:03,292
Count me out. You kids play.

1038
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:04,919
Come on, Ms. Shin!

1039
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:07,380
You’re on, right?

1040
01:19:12,718 --> 01:19:14,637
Let’s squash ‘em!

1041
01:19:14,637 --> 01:19:16,805
Don’t worry one bit.

1042
01:19:20,268 --> 01:19:22,728
Hey! Over here!

1043
01:19:22,728 --> 01:19:23,771
Charge in!

1044
01:19:25,356 --> 01:19:26,357
Move!

1045
01:19:27,942 --> 01:19:28,567
Shoot!

1046
01:19:32,363 --> 01:19:33,614
I scored!

1047
01:19:35,074 --> 01:19:36,575
Are you okay?

1048
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,044
I have a bad feeling...

1049
01:19:49,547 --> 01:19:51,465
Ms. Shin! Pass to her!

1050
01:19:51,465 --> 01:19:52,675
Ms. Shin! Pass!

1051
01:20:00,599 --> 01:20:02,601
Pass the ball!

1052
01:20:11,235 --> 01:20:11,945
Soo-ah!

1053
01:20:17,867 --> 01:20:18,701
Move!

1054
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:24,457
Soo-ah!

1055
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:26,750
Oh, no!

1056
01:20:32,423 --> 01:20:33,674
You did that on purpose, didn’t you!

1057
01:20:33,674 --> 01:20:35,509
No! I just...

1058
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:37,761
<i>Open</i>

1059
01:20:38,262 --> 01:20:39,222
<i>Closed</i>

1060
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:43,226
Don’t worry, Soo-ah.

1061
01:20:43,226 --> 01:20:44,810
I’ll bring it back to normal.

1062
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:48,356
Dong-bae is like the
village doctor. He’s good!

1063
01:20:48,772 --> 01:20:49,648
Be careful!

1064
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:58,824
Okay!

1065
01:20:59,783 --> 01:21:02,453
Wow! You did it!

1066
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,377
Hey!

1067
01:21:09,377 --> 01:21:10,753
Do you know what you’re doing?

1068
01:21:11,295 --> 01:21:13,464
Let’s try again, Soo-ah.

1069
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:16,968
I don’t believe this.

1070
01:21:19,387 --> 01:21:20,096
Who is it?

1071
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:32,566
Is Soo-ah okay?

1072
01:21:34,527 --> 01:21:35,194
There! I did it!

1073
01:21:35,194 --> 01:21:36,988
- Really?
- Hi, Yeon-hwa.

1074
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,325
What a relief!

1075
01:21:41,325 --> 01:21:42,410
Are you okay?

1076
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:49,458
I’m sorry.

1077
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,719
Are you kidding me?

1078
01:22:01,762 --> 01:22:06,142
You almost got her killed
and you offer apples?

1079
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:10,229
The apples are from the kids.

1080
01:22:12,273 --> 01:22:16,444
- Poor Soo-ah.
- It was your idea!

1081
01:22:16,444 --> 01:22:19,655
Oh, your friends are here.

1082
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:33,419
What’s that?

1083
01:22:37,298 --> 01:22:40,509
Way to go Soo-ah on your first day.

1084
01:22:40,509 --> 01:22:41,970
A zombie with friends!

1085
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:43,137
Isn’t that crazy?

1086
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:01,697
Jung-hwan. Must you keep doing this?

1087
01:23:01,697 --> 01:23:02,740
I know.

1088
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:07,453
No matter how hard I try, Soo-ah
may never return to normal.

1089
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:12,959
But whatever she may be, I
just want to be there for her

1090
01:23:12,959 --> 01:23:16,129
and help live life to the fullest.

1091
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:19,257
That’s all.

1092
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,431
I envy Soo-ah.

1093
01:23:29,725 --> 01:23:30,935
I’m sorry, Woo-seok.

1094
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:35,773
Maybe I should’ve waited a bit longer.

1095
01:23:35,773 --> 01:23:37,316
I should’ve protected you...

1096
01:23:43,322 --> 01:23:44,532
No way!

1097
01:23:44,532 --> 01:23:45,867
You tried to bite me!

1098
01:23:45,867 --> 01:23:47,410
You zombie son of a bitch!

1099
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:58,087
But you’re doing well up there, right?

1100
01:23:59,338 --> 01:24:01,174
Forget it!

1101
01:24:01,174 --> 01:24:03,676
How could you do that to me?

1102
01:24:03,676 --> 01:24:05,803
Damn zombie bastard!

1103
01:24:07,013 --> 01:24:12,852
Where are you, pal? She’s
acting weird. I’m scared.

1104
01:24:13,686 --> 01:24:17,273
A guest came at night

1105
01:24:17,273 --> 01:24:19,233
and you got riches.

1106
01:24:19,233 --> 01:24:21,777
This is a dud!

1107
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,162
She’s laughing!

1108
01:24:38,044 --> 01:24:39,879
Your dad must be home.

1109
01:24:49,555 --> 01:24:50,974
Did you forget your key?

1110
01:24:56,312 --> 01:24:57,771
Hello, mother-in-law.

1111
01:24:59,983 --> 01:25:03,152
What are you doing here?

1112
01:25:03,152 --> 01:25:06,822
I came to see my
mother-in-law. I missed you.

1113
01:25:06,822 --> 01:25:09,617
I’m not your mother-in-law. Go away!

1114
01:25:09,617 --> 01:25:10,826
Come on!

1115
01:25:14,288 --> 01:25:16,040
Still got that temper of yours?

1116
01:25:19,168 --> 01:25:21,754
Where’s Soo-ah?

1117
01:25:23,839 --> 01:25:25,466
Why do you ask?

1118
01:25:25,466 --> 01:25:29,178
Well, I saw something interesting.

1119
01:25:29,178 --> 01:25:31,264
<i>The zombie tried to attack me.</i>

1120
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,891
<i>What is the government doing?</i>

1121
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:35,226
<i>This zombie must be caught now!</i>

1122
01:25:35,226 --> 01:25:38,187
<i>There are still clueless
families to hide the infected?</i>

1123
01:25:38,187 --> 01:25:39,730
<i>I can’t believe it!</i>

1124
01:25:41,941 --> 01:25:44,318
They’re on the hunt for Soo-ah.

1125
01:25:49,157 --> 01:25:52,285
You took her away for this?
To turn her into a zombie?

1126
01:25:53,411 --> 01:25:55,872
You rootless bastard! How dare you!

1127
01:25:55,872 --> 01:25:58,541
- Get out! Scram!
- Hey!

1128
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:03,880
Soo-ah?

1129
01:26:05,839 --> 01:26:07,341
Let go!

1130
01:26:08,426 --> 01:26:10,136
I knew it!

1131
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:15,975
Soo-ah.

1132
01:26:15,975 --> 01:26:17,060
It’s Daddy.

1133
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:20,646
Shit.

1134
01:26:22,065 --> 01:26:23,066
What the hell?

1135
01:26:23,066 --> 01:26:24,859
Get out! Scram!

1136
01:26:24,859 --> 01:26:27,028
Get out of here, you bastard!

1137
01:26:27,028 --> 01:26:31,657
- Wait! Hold on!
- Get out of my house!

1138
01:26:31,657 --> 01:26:33,034
Stop it!

1139
01:26:35,703 --> 01:26:37,038
I told you to stop.

1140
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:45,838
Hi, Mom. I’m on my way.

1141
01:26:50,885 --> 01:26:51,635
What?

1142
01:26:54,472 --> 01:26:56,015
Right!

1143
01:26:56,015 --> 01:26:58,559
If you bring one in yourself,
you get twice the money.

1144
01:27:14,909 --> 01:27:17,661
Tell that bastard I’ll pay
him back with interest!

1145
01:27:36,055 --> 01:27:37,306
What?

1146
01:27:43,604 --> 01:27:44,272
Brother-in-law!

1147
01:27:56,993 --> 01:27:57,701
Soo-ah.

1148
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,044
Let’s go.

1149
01:28:09,797 --> 01:28:11,925
Damn annoying mother and son!

1150
01:28:13,134 --> 01:28:16,345
I’m taking my daughter!
Get the fuck out of my way!

1151
01:28:29,108 --> 01:28:30,526
You have no right!

1152
01:28:31,069 --> 01:28:32,403
Soo-ah is my daughter!

1153
01:28:32,987 --> 01:28:33,863
Daughter?

1154
01:28:33,863 --> 01:28:35,406
Are you fuckin’ crazy?

1155
01:28:36,157 --> 01:28:37,533
You’re one to talk.

1156
01:28:38,242 --> 01:28:39,743
You’re the one who killed Jung-hye.

1157
01:28:41,454 --> 01:28:42,956
If it wasn’t for you,

1158
01:28:42,956 --> 01:28:49,587
we could’ve been happy.
It’s all your damn fault!

1159
01:28:49,587 --> 01:28:51,380
If you’re a human being...

1160
01:28:53,591 --> 01:28:56,552
You can’t talk like that.

1161
01:28:57,386 --> 01:28:59,763
Soo-ah lived well and happy with me.

1162
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:03,476
Then you shouldn’t have
let her become a zombie!

1163
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:19,325
Wait! Hold on! Stop!

1164
01:29:22,036 --> 01:29:23,162
Let’s split it!

1165
01:29:24,998 --> 01:29:26,082
You didn’t know?

1166
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:30,711
Videos of you and Soo-ah at
the amusement park went viral!

1167
01:29:30,711 --> 01:29:32,130
Stupid moron.

1168
01:29:33,006 --> 01:29:39,553
If you don’t want to go to prison,
let’s report her and split the cash.

1169
01:29:39,553 --> 01:29:40,138
Okay?

1170
01:29:57,321 --> 01:29:58,865
Liked the idea of money, huh?

1171
01:29:59,908 --> 01:30:00,824
Die!

1172
01:30:00,824 --> 01:30:02,660
You son of a bitch!

1173
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,078
Die, you bastard!

1174
01:30:06,289 --> 01:30:07,456
Does it hurt?

1175
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:09,042
Stupid moron!

1176
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:10,418
Die, you bastard!

1177
01:30:11,002 --> 01:30:12,003
Die!

1178
01:30:30,146 --> 01:30:31,605
Soo-ah! No!

1179
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:36,360
Stop!

1180
01:30:38,779 --> 01:30:39,948
Fuck!

1181
01:30:45,203 --> 01:30:46,370
Stop!

1182
01:30:46,996 --> 01:30:48,414
Soo-ah! Stop!

1183
01:30:48,414 --> 01:30:50,083
Soo-ah! No!

1184
01:30:51,084 --> 01:30:52,710
You can’t bite people!

1185
01:30:54,045 --> 01:30:56,214
Not without my permission! Never!

1186
01:31:09,643 --> 01:31:10,728
Fuck!

1187
01:31:50,601 --> 01:31:51,560
Jung-hwan!

1188
01:31:57,859 --> 01:32:00,486
Why are you so hurt?

1189
01:32:00,486 --> 01:32:05,408
I’m fine, but Soo-ah has a fever.

1190
01:32:05,408 --> 01:32:07,618
- Please give her a warm bath.
- Sure.

1191
01:32:09,287 --> 01:32:10,204
What about him?

1192
01:32:12,206 --> 01:32:13,499
Don’t worry.

1193
01:32:15,418 --> 01:32:16,961
He won’t come again.

1194
01:32:20,464 --> 01:32:21,507
Let’s go.

1195
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:25,136
Dong-bae.

1196
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:28,514
Say you didn’t know anything.

1197
01:32:28,514 --> 01:32:32,435
You didn’t know Soo-ah
was infected. I tricked you.

1198
01:32:32,435 --> 01:32:34,020
What are you talking about?

1199
01:32:37,231 --> 01:32:39,442
I’m leaving here with Soo-ah.

1200
01:32:39,442 --> 01:32:40,234
What?

1201
01:32:41,861 --> 01:32:43,905
Are you crazy?

1202
01:32:43,905 --> 01:32:45,781
Then you’ll get charged
with escaping too!

1203
01:32:45,781 --> 01:32:48,284
You’ll become a serious felon!

1204
01:32:48,284 --> 01:32:50,536
I can’t put others in danger
because of this any longer.

1205
01:32:51,412 --> 01:32:54,332
Get rid of all of Soo-ah’s
pictures and don’t tell anyone.

1206
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:57,543
I’ll tell Yeon-hwa, myself.

1207
01:32:57,543 --> 01:32:58,752
No way!

1208
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:02,381
You’ve got it all wrong!
You’re not going anywhere!

1209
01:33:07,095 --> 01:33:08,471
Hey! Jung-hwan!

1210
01:33:09,472 --> 01:33:10,473
Lee Jung-hwan!

1211
01:33:31,953 --> 01:33:33,621
I heard from Dong-bae.

1212
01:33:35,164 --> 01:33:36,875
I’m coming with you.

1213
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:37,750
No, you can’t.

1214
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:39,002
Yes, I can!

1215
01:33:40,628 --> 01:33:41,754
I...

1216
01:33:45,383 --> 01:33:47,218
I can’t lose you two too.

1217
01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:52,765
I’m going with you. That’s that.

1218
01:33:58,354 --> 01:34:00,356
Dang cat.

1219
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:02,525
Oh, my.

1220
01:34:04,903 --> 01:34:07,906
You’ll live with Yeon-hwa from now on.

1221
01:34:11,117 --> 01:34:13,161
I got so attached to you.

1222
01:34:13,827 --> 01:34:15,204
I hope you understand.

1223
01:34:21,294 --> 01:34:23,212
Golly! Look.

1224
01:34:24,713 --> 01:34:26,257
He wants to come too.

1225
01:34:27,466 --> 01:34:29,427
Soo-ah brought Meowmeow home.

1226
01:34:43,441 --> 01:34:44,525
Churros.

1227
01:34:45,401 --> 01:34:48,154
What about the beef tripe?

1228
01:34:48,154 --> 01:34:49,822
Why do you always want churros?

1229
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:52,450
All packed up?

1230
01:34:53,617 --> 01:34:55,078
Let’s get going then.

1231
01:34:55,078 --> 01:34:56,079
Wait, Mom.

1232
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:58,414
I promised to meet Yeon-hwa,

1233
01:35:00,959 --> 01:35:05,964
but can you give this to
her instead? If I see her...

1234
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:08,341
I don’t think I can say much.

1235
01:35:08,341 --> 01:35:11,219
You’re so frustrating...

1236
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:13,304
You stayed up all night to write this?

1237
01:35:22,188 --> 01:35:24,273
Ma’am, let’s go!

1238
01:35:24,648 --> 01:35:32,531
First, he called me to meet up, then
he asked me to buy some churros.

1239
01:35:32,531 --> 01:35:36,744
That’s because Soo-ah
craves churros so much.

1240
01:35:39,205 --> 01:35:40,915
- What’s in there?
- Hmm?

1241
01:35:40,915 --> 01:35:42,291
That.

1242
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:44,127
You keep pulling it in and out.

1243
01:35:59,934 --> 01:36:01,269
- Yeon-hwa.
- Yes?

1244
01:36:03,312 --> 01:36:04,397
Let’s go back.

1245
01:36:19,996 --> 01:36:22,248
<i>A suspected infectee has been located.</i>

1246
01:36:22,248 --> 01:36:24,458
<i>Start by scouring the area.</i>

1247
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:27,003
<i>If you find the infectee,</i>

1248
01:36:27,003 --> 01:36:28,546
kill it immediately.

1249
01:36:30,924 --> 01:36:34,177
<i>The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.</i>

1250
01:36:34,177 --> 01:36:35,094
Oh, no...

1251
01:36:48,816 --> 01:36:52,946
<i>Mom, Yeon-hwa, and Dong-bae.</i>

1252
01:36:52,946 --> 01:36:57,533
<i>By the time you read this
letter, I’ll be long gone.</i>

1253
01:36:58,784 --> 01:37:01,913
<i>I did what I had to
do to protect Soo-ah,</i>

1254
01:37:01,913 --> 01:37:03,873
<i>but I committed an unforgiveable sin.</i>

1255
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:09,128
<i>Since it’s all my fault,
I’ll pay the price.</i>

1256
01:37:12,215 --> 01:37:15,969
<i>Every day in Eunbong-ri
has been precious.</i>

1257
01:37:15,969 --> 01:37:16,928
<i>Thank you.</i>

1258
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:23,267
<i>From now on, I’ll deal with it my way.</i>

1259
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:27,063
<i>I’m sorry for what I did.</i>

1260
01:37:28,857 --> 01:37:33,152
<i>I’m sorry, Mom.
Please forgive your son.</i>

1261
01:37:33,152 --> 01:37:36,072
<i>I’m sorry Yeon-hwa and Dong-bae.</i>

1262
01:37:36,072 --> 01:37:39,951
<i>Please take good care of
my mom and Meowmeow.</i>

1263
01:37:52,088 --> 01:37:53,089
Soo-ah.

1264
01:37:54,382 --> 01:37:59,262
Let’s go play on the island
again. Happy, right?

1265
01:38:01,305 --> 01:38:02,848
Churros.

1266
01:38:04,558 --> 01:38:06,685
Don’t worry.

1267
01:38:06,685 --> 01:38:08,855
We’ll be the only ones there.

1268
01:38:32,836 --> 01:38:33,922
Soo-ah! Let’s go!

1269
01:38:38,301 --> 01:38:39,510
<i>Suspects found up ahead!</i>

1270
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:41,095
<i>Approaching a male and a female!</i>

1271
01:38:48,061 --> 01:38:49,395
Stay here, Soo-ah.

1272
01:38:50,604 --> 01:38:55,109
Don’t come out until I call you.

1273
01:38:57,403 --> 01:38:58,112
Mr. Lee Jung-hwan!

1274
01:38:59,197 --> 01:39:00,031
Mr. Lee!

1275
01:39:03,617 --> 01:39:06,704
Jung-hwan! It’s Mom!

1276
01:39:06,704 --> 01:39:10,458
The captain wants to talk to you.

1277
01:39:12,585 --> 01:39:13,419
Mr. Lee.

1278
01:39:14,462 --> 01:39:16,339
Are you with the infectee?

1279
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,180
Yes.

1280
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:28,977
I’m so sorry... I... ah...

1281
01:39:31,312 --> 01:39:37,318
I should’ve reported it. I was wrong.

1282
01:39:37,318 --> 01:39:39,570
Please come out to talk.

1283
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:41,239
It’s dangerous to be with an infectee.

1284
01:39:41,239 --> 01:39:43,407
No, my daughter is not dangerous!

1285
01:39:45,409 --> 01:39:47,453
She doesn’t bite and can even talk!

1286
01:39:48,872 --> 01:39:51,790
Mr. Lee! This is your final warning.

1287
01:39:51,790 --> 01:39:52,959
Open the door.

1288
01:39:55,461 --> 01:39:56,545
I’ll come out.

1289
01:39:57,964 --> 01:39:58,882
But...

1290
01:39:58,882 --> 01:40:00,591
Promise me one thing.

1291
01:40:01,592 --> 01:40:02,801
My daughter Soo-ah...

1292
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,350
Please don’t kill her.

1293
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:12,896
We don’t negotiate with criminals.

1294
01:40:17,525 --> 01:40:18,734
- Ma’am!
- No! Stop!

1295
01:40:23,865 --> 01:40:25,116
Jung-hwan!

1296
01:40:25,116 --> 01:40:26,534
Jung-hwan! No!

1297
01:40:42,591 --> 01:40:44,052
Soo-ah, I’m sorry.

1298
01:40:45,511 --> 01:40:50,099
I’m sorry I can’t
protect you till the end.

1299
01:40:56,147 --> 01:40:58,066
Soo-ah, listen to me.

1300
01:41:01,027 --> 01:41:04,989
Bite... Daddy.

1301
01:41:10,078 --> 01:41:11,620
You have to bite me.

1302
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:14,540
It’s the only way we’ll
be together forever.

1303
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,294
Listen!

1304
01:41:18,294 --> 01:41:20,713
This way, wherever you go,

1305
01:41:22,882 --> 01:41:24,758
Daddy can follow you.

1306
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,391
It’s okay.

1307
01:41:37,146 --> 01:41:39,023
Bite me, Soo-ah.

1308
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:22,525
Mr. Lee Jung-hwan!

1309
01:42:22,525 --> 01:42:23,860
Step away from the infectee!

1310
01:42:30,074 --> 01:42:30,824
Aim!

1311
01:42:34,162 --> 01:42:34,703
Fire!

1312
01:42:51,345 --> 01:42:58,269
- No!
- Jung-hwan!

1313
01:43:16,996 --> 01:43:17,580
Stop!

1314
01:43:22,376 --> 01:43:23,586
Da...

1315
01:43:28,216 --> 01:43:29,968
Dad...

1316
01:43:34,388 --> 01:43:36,474
Dad... dy...

1317
01:43:38,184 --> 01:43:39,727
Daddy...

1318
01:43:40,269 --> 01:43:42,146
That’s right, Soo-ah.

1319
01:43:42,813 --> 01:43:44,523
Dad...

1320
01:43:50,488 --> 01:43:51,865
I’m your dad.

1321
01:43:53,074 --> 01:43:54,742
It’s me...

1322
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,499
Well done.

1323
01:44:03,251 --> 01:44:05,920
Dad...

1324
01:44:10,341 --> 01:44:12,760
Dad...

1325
01:44:15,138 --> 01:44:17,056
Dad...

1326
01:44:19,893 --> 01:44:22,353
Dad!

1327
01:44:24,688 --> 01:44:27,483
Daddy!

1328
01:44:30,153 --> 01:44:33,239
Daddy!

1329
01:44:34,949 --> 01:44:38,244
Daddy!

1330
01:44:39,871 --> 01:44:42,456
Daddy!

1331
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:45,877
Daddy!

1332
01:45:13,863 --> 01:45:14,780
Uncle?

1333
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:20,703
Thanks for being my dad.

1334
01:45:38,972 --> 01:45:39,973
Soo-ah?

1335
01:45:42,141 --> 01:45:43,017
Soo-ah?

1336
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:49,482
Soo-ah? Can you hear me?

1337
01:45:50,859 --> 01:45:52,276
Soo-ah?

1338
01:45:58,699 --> 01:45:59,951
Soo-ah!

1339
01:46:04,288 --> 01:46:05,664
Granny...

1340
01:46:13,797 --> 01:46:15,841
Where’s Dad?

1341
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,656
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO
<i>Lee, a former zookeeper,</i>

1342
01:46:38,656 --> 01:46:45,079
<i>secretly harbored his daughter, who
was infected with the GAR virus.</i>

1343
01:46:45,079 --> 01:46:48,749
<i>Lee is currently unconscious
and is being treated in hospital.</i>

1344
01:46:48,749 --> 01:46:54,047
<i>As neutralizing antibodies have
been found in Lee’s blood...</i>

1345
01:46:54,047 --> 01:46:57,716
<i>Hopes for a cure are growing.</i>

1346
01:46:57,716 --> 01:47:03,306
Neutralizing antibodies of the virus
has been found in Mr. Lee’s blood.

1347
01:47:05,683 --> 01:47:07,768
What’s unique is that

1348
01:47:07,768 --> 01:47:14,150
Mr. Lee’s symptoms of infections
are improving even while comatose.

1349
01:47:15,318 --> 01:47:22,283
But from being repeatedly
wounded by Soo-ah and healing,

1350
01:47:22,283 --> 01:47:24,577
<i>Mr. Lee seems to have
developed immunity.</i>

1351
01:47:29,582 --> 01:47:31,750
<i>Much like being vaccinated,</i>

1352
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:35,629
<i>Mr. Lee’s body created
antibodies to the virus on its own.</i>

1353
01:47:38,174 --> 01:47:42,095
<i>We plan to put Mr. Lee’s
antigens in Soo-ah</i>

1354
01:47:42,095 --> 01:47:44,513
to see if she produces antibodies.

1355
01:47:52,771 --> 01:47:54,023
Soo-ah? Here.

1356
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:01,489
SOO-AH’S TRAINING RECORD

1357
01:48:04,658 --> 01:48:06,660
<i>She didn’t try to bite today.</i>

1358
01:48:07,286 --> 01:48:08,913
<i>Is it really because of beef tripe?</i>

1359
01:48:11,124 --> 01:48:12,750
<i>Soo-ah is doing really well.</i>

1360
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,460
<i>I should cheer up more.</i>

1361
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,129
<i>Let’s go family!</i>

1362
01:48:19,007 --> 01:48:22,135
<i>Things Soo-ah likes.
Playing with Meowmeow.</i>

1363
01:48:24,803 --> 01:48:26,389
<i>Playing cards with Granny.</i>

1364
01:48:32,311 --> 01:48:33,021
Soo-ah.

1365
01:48:38,609 --> 01:48:43,281
<i>OMG! Soo-ah gave me the cat kiss!</i>

1366
01:48:45,408 --> 01:48:47,618
<i>Whether Soo-ah is sick or fine,</i>

1367
01:48:47,618 --> 01:48:49,537
<i>she’ll always be my daughter.</i>

1368
01:48:55,584 --> 01:48:56,794
Daddy...

1369
01:49:27,825 --> 01:49:28,826
Want this?
