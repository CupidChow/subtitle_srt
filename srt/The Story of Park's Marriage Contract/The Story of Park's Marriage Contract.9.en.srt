2
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,220
I feel so bad for her. Oh, my god!

3
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,660
Goodness.

4
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,330
Goodness, My Lady...

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,620
Goodness, Madam...

6
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,860
Let go of me.

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,920
Let go of me!

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,050
She is not our Yeon Woo.

9
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,320
I must check for myself!

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,740
They say her face is so messed up that you cannot recognize her.

11
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,700
I would know if I saw her!

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,780
Because I am her mother...

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,550
I would know if I saw her.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,700
Our Yeon Woo is not the type of girl who would die such a futile death.

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,130
Please, please, please!

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,360
Please let me at least check her face!

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,890
Dear Wife.

18
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,340
- Please!
- Dear Wife!

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,530
There is no way!

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,570
It is not Yeon Woo! It is not her!

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,890
- Wife...
- It is not Yeon Woo...

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,250
It is not Yeon Woo...

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,450
Yeon Woo...

24
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,800
Yeon Woo...

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,480
Yeon Woo, my baby...

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,550
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo.

27
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,470
Dear Wife!

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,390
Are you all right? Dear Wife!

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,440
Yeon Woo.

30
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,830
Yeon Woo.

31
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,750
Yeon Woo.

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,600
Dear Wife! Wake up, Dear Wife!

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,590
Dear Wife!

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,100
Dear Wife...

35
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,240
Yeon Woo died as a Loyal Wife? There is no way.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,680
Something definitely happened.

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,560
I will make sure to find out who did this to you and—

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,410
Mother...

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,760
Father...

40
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,860
- My Lady!
- Ms. Yeon Woo!

41
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,180
My Lady!

42
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,350
Yeon Woo.

43
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,210
Yeon Woo.

44
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,420
[Episode 9: The link in the broken connection]

45
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,520
Please leave.

46
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,970
- Sa Wol.
- Your family...

47
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,660
tried to kill My Lady, Young Master.

48
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,340
How dare you think you can come here?

49
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,190
Leave.

50
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,680
I said, leave!

51
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,450
Can't you hear me? I said to leave!

52
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,570
- Hey, Sa Wol.
- Leave!

53
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,150
Sa Wol, what is wrong?

54
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,810
Why do you think the Kang family received a memorial headstone for a loyal wife?

55
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,390
Why? Why?

56
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,020
Stop doing this and let's go out together.

57
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,830
Hurry.

58
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,410
There is no worse ill-fated relationship than this.

59
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,300
So, the Deputy CEO's family killed Ms. Yeon Woo 200 years ago

60
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,070
and received a memorial headstone for a Loyal Wife?

61
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,560
Evil bastards.

62
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,400
Inhumane bastards.

63
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,540
How could a person...

64
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,770
Don't cry, Sa Wol.

65
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,690
My Lady...

66
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,400
I feel so sorry for her.

67
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,570
What is going on here?

68
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,850
Your family tried to kill her, Young Master.

69
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,020
Are you awake?

70
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,420
This embroidered cloth was passed down through my mother's family.

71
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,940
It is about 200 years old.

72
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,420
I had made this...

73
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,950
for my mother before my wedding.

74
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,590
I had my doubts...

75
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,550
but the butterfly from the letter and the diary was really you, Yeon Woo.

76
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,890
Diary?

77
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,370
Actually, I came because of this.

78
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,300
Originally, the diary was only filled in up until your wedding,

79
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,820
but today, new content appeared after it.

80
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,140
[Young Soo's Diary]

81
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,530
Are you saying that words filled the diary by itself?

82
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,430
That's right.

83
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,320
The Kang family received government positions, thanks to the memorial headstone for a Loyal Wife.

84
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,180
It is clear that woman, Madam Yoon, did something evil to Yeon Woo.

85
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,910
What I saw was true...

86
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,010
Mother...

87
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,040
Father...

88
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,170
It's okay.

89
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,810
It's all right.

90
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,080
The two of them died because of me.

91
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,510
At first,

92
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,470
I thought everything was a coincidence.

93
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,590
How my husband passed away,

94
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,560
and how I was kidnapped and thrown into the well.

95
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,430
However, that was not true.

96
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,150
Both my husband and I were killed for the memorial headstone.

97
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,970
What do you mean by that?

98
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,940
My husband was poisoned to death...

99
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,590
by his stepmother, Madam Yoon.

100
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,330
Stepmother...

101
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,580
By chance...

102
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,370
The current CEO Min is Madam Yoon.

103
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,680
However,

104
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,870
I did not know my parents would end up like that...

105
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,710
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,480
I am just...

107
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,820
sorry for everything.

108
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,360
It isn't our fault.

109
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,530
We are just stuck with a wretched fate.

110
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,350
Who are you?

111
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,250
Is that important?

112
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,090
I'm sure you are curious about something else.

113
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,090
This is arsenic.

114
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,700
Who would suspect anything when a child with a heart condition suddenly dies?

115
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,890
This is the only way for me to get what I want.

116
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,110
Why are you showing me such a vision?

117
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,880
Because it is my past life?

118
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,700
What does that have to do with Yeon Woo and me?

119
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,120
What do you want?

120
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,370
I don't want anything.

121
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,520
But one thing is for sure.

122
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,840
If you stay with Lady, you will end up like your past life—

123
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,940
I will end up dead like in my past life?

124
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,400
Because it is a repeating fate?

125
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,880
If my heart suddenly got worse because of that fate,

126
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,630
that's a relief.

127
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,450
At least I'm getting punished.

128
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,230
So you are saying it's fine if you die?

129
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,410
If that is best for Yeon Woo,

130
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,500
I will do so to protect her.

131
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,050
Nowadays, noodles like this are everywhere.

132
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,580
But I wonder why it was so rare in the past.

133
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,400
That's why we only got to eat this during a celebration.

134
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,730
The broth for this is clean and tasty.

135
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,810
Say what you want to say instead of beating about the bush.

136
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,960
Let's see. When was it again?

137
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,120
The noodles I ate on the day Yoon Hee died and President Min...

138
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,120
The noodles I ate after your father's burial were good, too.

139
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,740
What are you doing right now?

140
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,430
You should leave my house and my company now.

141
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,540
Your childish threats won't work on me, Father.

142
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,190
It will be better for you to leave as soon as possible.

143
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,790
If you understand what I am saying, wrap things up and leave now.

144
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,750
If you want to protect your amazing company, you should get rid of your grandson first.

145
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,580
If Tae Ha becomes CEO and then dies,

146
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,630
it will pass into the hands of a management specialist.

147
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,680
Thanks for your advice.

148
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,010
I asked him to bring me here.

149
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,990
I was worried that Sis was not eating well.

150
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,140
And I didn't want to stay longer in that wretched Kang family's home.

151
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
I guess I am...

152
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,460
sorry for yesterday.

153
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,750
It's okay. Thank you for coming.

154
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,950
Yeon Woo will be happy you're here.

155
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,390
What is Sis doing?

156
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,780
She should be resting in her room.

157
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,800
I should make some food for her to eat.

158
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,170
I brought her because she made such a fuss, but don't worry.

159
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,330
I will make sure to take Sa Wol back.

160
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,100
Thank you.

161
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,340
Oh, and please cancel my entire schedule for today.

162
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,240
I've got a bad feeling.

163
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,910
It feels like the quiet before a storm.

164
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,580
Why? Is a typhoon coming?

165
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,510
I'm talking about the Deputy CEO.

166
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,400
He revealed his heart ailment and

167
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,540
even made a controversial statement about management specialists and whatnot,

168
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,340
but he didn't come in to work today.

169
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,230
I also couldn't get in contact with Yeon Woo.

170
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,170
I need to talk to her about the pop-up store.

171
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,110
Something smells fishy about this.

172
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,890
What will you do now?

173
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,420
I heard that Chairman Kang is adamant

174
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,980
about kicking you out, CEO.

175
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,430
It's fine. I expected this.

176
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,600
Still, it seems a bit more serious than usual this time.

177
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,440
So, you have the next card for this. Right?

178
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,450
Are you serious right now?

179
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,070
You should have prepared a plan!

180
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,060
What do I know? I only do what you tell me to do faithfully, CEO—

181
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,240
Director Hwang Myeong Soo!

182
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,500
Gosh, Kang Tae Ha, that bastard.

184
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,720
He has such a bad heart, yet he doesn't collapse!

185
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,420
But you know the medication that Kang Tae Ha takes?

186
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,360
I heard that medication prevents heart failure, too.

187
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,660
If we can just get rid of his medication, he'd be a dead man walking.

188
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,790
That's enough. You may leave.

189
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,430
Oh, okay. Got it.

190
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,390
[Tombstone of Loyal Wife Yeon Woo]

191
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,560
It really says Yeon Woo on the memorial headstone of a Loyal Wife.

192
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,550
It's not like it's Romeo and Juliet.

193
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,820
But about the diary.

194
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,630
Isn't it a bit weird?

195
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,280
In the documents I found, Ms.Yeon Woo and her parents all died without any issues.

196
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,970
The history probably changed.

197
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,830
Pardon?

198
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,640
Because Yeon Woo and I...

199
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,870
figured out the hidden truth.

200
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,410
What do we do now, then?

201
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,580
I will find a way to put things back where they belong.

202
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,990
That's why I came here.

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,300
I will make sure to drive out CEO Min at this upcoming general meeting.

204
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,040
Of course! Yes, you should.

205
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,420
Let's put everything back where it belongs now.

206
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,380
You and me, together.

207
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,570
After that, I will discuss transitioning to a management specialist system,

208
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,730
and when everything is resolved, I will also resign from the Deputy CEO position.

209
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,400
W-What did you say?

210
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,430
Resign?

211
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,290
I will think only about Yeon Woo and me now.

212
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,180
Y-You said you would end that contract marriage!

213
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,250
No, I will keep her by my side.

214
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,460
No matter what happens.

215
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,880
No. I can't allow you to be with Yeon Woo.

216
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,670
- Grandfather!
- You crazy bastard!

217
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,160
You will give up on the company for a measly girl?

218
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,440
Did Yeon Woo tell you to do this?

219
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,100
This has nothing to do with Yeon Woo.

220
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,100
I no longer have any reason to protect SH.

221
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,340
N-No reason to protect SH?

222
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,860
No reason?

223
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,430
Is that something you should say to your grandfather?

224
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,160
Do you know how I raised you after Jung Hoon and Yoon Hee died?

225
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,120
I no longer want anyone to get hurt because of needless greed.

226
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,840
I don't want to get caught up with the past and lose what is precious to me.

227
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,830
I will live the rest of my life feeling apologetic toward you, Grandfather.

228
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,700
Get out! Get out!

229
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,810
Leave this instant!

230
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,100
I'm sorry.

231
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,380
Sis!

232
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,960
I brought some pine nut porridge and salted pollack roe.

233
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,700
This was what you ate when you got sick.

234
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,800
Here. This salted pollack roe is different from what you ate in Joseon,

235
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
so try it.

236
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,070
It's good. Thanks.

237
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,290
From now on, I will always stay by your side, so don't worry—

238
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,930
It's fine. You don't have to do that.

239
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,500
I just need some time to think.

240
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,530
Okay. I understand.

241
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,940
In return, eat the rest of this porridge. Then I'll leave.

242
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,510
Okay. I'll do that.

243
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,640
Hey, April. Why are you back already?

244
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,480
I told you I'd come pick you up.

245
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,860
Lady told me to go home.

246
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
Ms. Yeon Woo said that?

247
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,890
Then, why do you look so sad?

248
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,470
Is something wrong?

249
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,390
I just felt so useless.

250
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,820
Lady is going through such a hard time like that,

251
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,460
and yet I can't do anything for her as her servant.

252
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,560
Who is a servant?

253
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,030
Sa Wol, you are no longer a servant.

254
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,180
You are just Sa Wol.

255
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,320
My lovely April.

256
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,200
Seong Pyo...

257
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Don't forget. There is only one servant now.

258
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,390
It's me.

259
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,370
Hong Seong Pyo.

260
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,050
Na Rae was here?

261
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,550
Na Rae was home...

262
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,480
This is what you call fooling around.

263
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,510
I'm going to work.

264
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,980
Bye.

265
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,990
So tasty.

266
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,340
I pray today, too...

267
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,180
that Yeon Woo does not give up.

268
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,420
To protect herself in the midst of fear and pain.

269
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,340
That is what I pray and hope for.

270
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,010
Yes, Mother.

271
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,840
I will make sure to do so.

272
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:46,900
I've never thought about what I wanted.

273
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,040
Grandfather's dream...

274
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,660
was always my dream.

275
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,990
It was the first time...

276
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,070
that I've dreamed of a different life.

277
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,550
If you don't like my house, you can run away.

278
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,600
I will chase after you, whatever it takes.

279
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,870
I won't ever...

280
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,010
I won't ever let you go, Yeon Woo.

281
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,370
I keep thinking about it.

282
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,930
Why...

283
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,500
Why did things end up like this?

284
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,860
But I realized that the reason wasn't important, but...

285
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,290
me, living in this current moment.

286
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,150
I won't lose to nor run away from fate.

287
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,820
And I will put everything back in its place.

288
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,710
You should do that with me now.

289
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,840
Goodness, when will you finish if you do it like this?

290
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,740
I'll take care of the sweeping. Go ahead and clean up the rest.

291
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,770
What are you doing? Give it to me. It's my job.

292
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,230
Gosh, I'm just paying for what I ate.

293
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,630
I should at least earn my keep since I live at your place.

294
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,990
Don't hate me too much, Na Rae.

295
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,780
I have no intention of stealing your brother from you.

296
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,130
W-What are you saying? Am I a school kid or something?

297
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,620
Why are you saying such a weird thing?

298
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,110
Honestly, I kind of hate you a little bit.

299
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,530
Since you are the one Seong Pyo cares about the most.

300
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,790
Then we're even, right?

301
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,670
So let's get along. Okay?

302
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,880
Kimchi fried rice.

303
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,380
Sorry?

304
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,390
W-What did you say?

305
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,370
I heard you're a good cook.

306
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,390
I like kimchi fried rice, so earn your keep with that.

307
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,610
What else do you like?

308
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,750
Tteokbokki.

309
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,060
I happen to be really good at making tteokbokki!

310
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,710
- Really?
- Yeah!

311
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,810
I like rosé tteokbokki.

312
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,340
Ro—

313
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,620
Whatever! How could you be so cute, Na Rae?

314
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,240
What did Grandfather say?

315
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,480
He was furious.

316
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,410
He may say something to you, too, Yeon Woo.

317
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,190
It's fine.

318
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,530
He only does that because he worries about you, Tae Ha.

319
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:09,190
Not only that but isn't your grandfather the most precious person to you?

320
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,060
Thank you.

321
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,460
Oh, and...

322
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,210
a person named Cheon Myeong appeared to me, too.

323
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,770
Really?

324
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,550
Did Cheon Myeong say anything?

325
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,650
If you stay with Lady,

326
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,090
you will end up like your past life—

327
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,420
I will end up dead like my past life?

328
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,960
Since it is a repeating fate?

329
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,470
She said to stay by your side, Yeon Woo.

330
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,930
No matter what happens.

331
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,240
Don't worry.

332
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,770
I won't just let things happen this time.

333
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,820
I will make sure to protect you.

334
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,430
Like a bodyguard?

335
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,830
Body...

336
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,790
What is that?

337
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,960
It's something really good for both your body and your heart.

338
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,420
I see.

339
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,980
Is it even better than Choco?

340
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,960
It may be.

341
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,490
T-Then, let's go right now and buy it. That "body," whatever.

342
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,830
Wait, Yeon Woo.

343
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,500
Wait!

344
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,440
Did you sleep well?

345
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,420
Hi, Aunt.

346
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,010
Gosh, it looks delicious.

347
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,700
Didn't you hear from your mother?

348
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,100
Pardon?

349
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,460
About what?

350
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,280
I'll let you and your mother move out.

351
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,250
Father, really?

352
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,480
Your mother will be leaving the company soon.

353
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,930
So, you should take care of your mother.

354
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,820
Go live outside of this house. That way, you'll learn the way of the world.

355
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,650
What is it?

356
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,170
Why?

357
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,320
Don't worry about it. We won't be leaving here.

358
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,730
Did you mess with Kang Tae Ha's heart ailment?

359
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,970
Is that why you told me to prepare to become Director and whatnot?

360
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,370
An owner's health is an important matter linked to a company's profits.

361
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,460
But it's an illness. He is sick!

362
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,540
How could you think to use that?

363
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,580
It was a necessary action for SH's sake.

364
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,580
And this is the result?

365
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,720
Grandfather has completely turned on us.

366
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,970
It's all over now.

367
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,790
We'll see if it's over or not.

368
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,510
There is no backing out now.

369
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,690
CEO Min!

370
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,410
Mom.

371
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,910
Is something wrong?

372
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,410
Why?

373
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,540
Do I look like a guy with a worry?

374
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,020
Is this more attractive?

375
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,230
A joke is only a joke if the person hearing it finds it funny.

376
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,780
You went back to Kang Tae Ha's home. Right?

377
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,950
You don't regret it?

378
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,680
Yes, I don't do stuff like that.

379
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,490
That's so like you, Mourning Clothes.

380
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,920
I always regretted being born into my family.

381
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,540
My brother was always better than me, and

382
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,900
my mom was so scary.

383
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,280
And my grandfather only cared about my brother.

384
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,970
I always wondered if it was okay for me to be in that family.

385
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,580
That's why I'm worried about you.

386
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,830
Afraid that you may get messed up like me.

387
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,530
But you're different.

388
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,470
You were always energetic and smiling.

389
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,850
Well, I guess I just liked that.

390
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,620
I was envious, too.

391
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,980
I guess that's why you kept catching my eye.

392
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,370
Why are you saying these things to me all of a sudden?

393
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,910
Is something really wrong?

394
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,120
I told you. I'm just worried about you.

395
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,580
Next time, if you're struggling or hurting,

396
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,440
just come to me. Okay?

397
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,050
Don't worry.

398
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,520
I will take care of my own business.

399
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,270
So firm in drawing the line.

400
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,100
Shall we get up now?

401
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,500
We should get to work now.

402
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,650
This isn't where you can just come and go as you please.

403
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,130
Grandfather told CEO Min and me to leave.

404
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,010
It doesn't matter to me,

405
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,400
but CEO Min will probably plot something else.

406
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,900
I'm just letting you know.

407
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,770
Why are you telling me?

408
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,130
Take care of Mourning Clothes yourself.

409
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,840
Grandfather and CEO Min would be willing to do anything for SH.

410
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,480
Leave her to me if she's too much of a burden.

411
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,750
Forget it. We'll take care of ourselves.

412
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,410
Gosh, so annoying.

413
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,630
Yes, CEO Lee.

414
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:59,300
About the US Congresswoman you talked about last time...

415
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,420
Get rid of CEO Min at this upcoming general meeting.

416
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,230
What do you mean, get rid of her?

417
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,280
Chairman, things got noisy due to Deputy CEO Kang,

418
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,860
and things have only just subsided.

419
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,290
And if you talk so lightly about firing the CEO...

420
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,890
All right. Got it.

421
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,120
Director Choi, get Director Go's resignation as well.

422
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,470
Chairman.

423
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:24,360
Go Heung Soon, Choi Joo Myeong, Kim Jin Ho, Oh Byeong Cheol.

424
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,780
Whose idea was it to make you guys Director, Managing Director, and Executive Director?

425
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,240
And yet you say what now?

426
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,860
I understand your wishes, Chairman.

427
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,280
[Precious Princess ♥]

428
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,100
Yes.

429
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,220
Tae Ha, where are you right now?

430
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,980
Where are you, Yeon Woo?

431
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,700
I am...

432
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,180
in front of our home.

433
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,410
Did you say home?

434
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,740
That's right.

435
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,010
In any case, work hard since you're still at work.

436
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,490
Is this our home?

437
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,730
Oh, about that...

438
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,510
I was just going to surprise you...

439
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,450
You didn't...

440
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,010
follow me, did you?

441
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,330
I know, right?

442
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:50,760
My feet keep following you around.

443
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,240
I guess I should teach your feet a lesson.

444
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,250
Now my lips are doing it, too. What do we do?

445
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,150
What else?

446
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,400
Teach them a lesson, too.

447
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,970
Secretary Hong, what are you doing here?

448
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,550
Oh, well...

449
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,480
the thing is...

450
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,050
I had something urgent to report, so I was waiting for you,

451
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,360
but you suddenly came in and started saying surprising and teaching a lesson and all—

452
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,620
Your mouth!

453
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,510
Please shut your mouth!

454
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,300
But I didn't see anything.

455
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,580
I don't know if that smooching sound came from the cheek, lips, or feet—

456
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,330
Your mouth!

457
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,460
Are you saying this guy is tailing us?

458
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,370
You were right, Deputy CEO.

459
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,390
CEO Min probably hired someone to tail Yeon Woo and me.

460
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,030
That's probably how she found out about my heart ailment.

461
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,540
Park Yeon Woo!

462
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,330
We must catch that guy.

463
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,510
Damn it. I should just beat that guy up!

464
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sa Wol.

465
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,460
At times like this, we should use our heads, not our fists.

466
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,390
- Head?
- Yup.

467
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,820
Headbutting?

468
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,880
Then, I should crack open his skull by headbutting him!

469
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,100
Sa Wol, that's not it.

470
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,510
Using my head... that's not it?

471
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,850
Identify this man first.

472
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,600
Don't worry about that.

473
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,490
I have a plan.

474
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:10,900
Seong Pyo, it feels like we're the protagonists of a movie doing something like this.

475
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,280
I'll be right back. So, stay put.

476
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,830
Okay.

477
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,940
He's so cool.

478
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,970
Seong Pyo.

479
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,360
Seong Pyo!

480
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,240
Oh, my! Tae Min oppa!

481
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,150
You're Tae Min oppa. Right?

482
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,380
You've got the wrong person.

483
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,070
No, it's you, immature Tae Min oppa.

484
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,470
Gosh, it's not. Is it innocent Ji Seok Joo oppa?

485
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,380
Gosh, I said you've got the wrong guy.

486
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,580
I'm sure it's you. Tae Min oppa—

487
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,340
Seok Joo oppa. Tae Min oppa?

488
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,770
Seong Pyo?

489
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,220
Seong Pyo?

490
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,250
What was that!

491
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,440
Gosh, you're just so perfect!

492
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,540
That GP...

493
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,190
GP... GP machine. Did you attach it?

494
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,640
I attached the GP machine.

495
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,860
What's wrong? Are you nervous?

496
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,740
Yes.

497
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,450
This is my first customer.

498
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,110
Not only that, but she is a high-ranking official in a big country,

499
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,710
so I'm a bit nervous that I may make a mistake.

500
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,640
Don't worry.

501
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,230
The congresswoman is a really good person.

502
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,670
Are you Master Ho Jeob?

503
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,470

00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,920
- Have you been well?
- Yes, have you been well?

507
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,130
Your Highness the Princess, you look so pretty.

508
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,410

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,060
It's nice to meet you.

- Please take a seat.
- Okay.

512
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:01,100
My daughter kept begging me to get some of your clothes.

513
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,520
I fell in love after seeing them on social media.

514
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,040
The clothes were so pretty.

517
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,130
You seem familiar.

518
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,980
I feel like we've met somewhere before.

519
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,690
Oh, my. You must have some connection with Yeon Woo.

520
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,840
I guess so.

521
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,800
So, what do we need to do first?

522
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,270
You would have to spread them.

523
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,670

A US Congresswoman is wearing Yeon Woo's clothes?

526
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,270
This is crazy. I have to hand it to her.

527
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,020
This will be good PR for Yeon Woo before her popup.

Ha Na will prepare for the interview with the congresswoman,

529

so Seok Joo and Tae Min, focus on the protocol.

I will handle the protocol for the congresswoman's daughter since I've got the looks.

Gosh, I'm fine with everything, but am I not the looker of the group?

00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,830
I see... Home?

542
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,700
Did you think I would fall for it twice?

543
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,580
Do you think I'm stupid?

544
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,710
How was it? Did the meeting with the congresswoman go well?

545
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,990
It was so darned good.

546
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,020
That I wanted to run around all over the place!

547
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,010
Really?

548
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,240
Then, could you go somewhere with me?

549
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,430
Where is this place?

550
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,330
You said you wanted to run around.

551
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,780
Run as much as you want.

552
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,590
It's soft!

553
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,020
Be careful!

554
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:40,960
♫ What should I do? My cheeks get hot the moment I see you ♫

555
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,730
♫ My heart is shaking, can you hear my heart? ♫

556
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:52,200
​♫ Your way of speaking is still unknown to me, but I still like it ♫

557
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,230
♫ It feels like the whole world is in your eyes ♫

558
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,490
It's been so long since I ran. It feels so darned good.

559
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,040
How does it feel to run?

560
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,740
I used to watch people run around here sometimes.

561
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,730
Thinking what sounds your heart would make when you run until you run out of breath.

562
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,920
Would it hurt? Would it feel good?

563
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,360
Thinking about stuff like that.

564
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,960
After you run, it's like this.

565
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,300
Right here goes thump, thump.

566
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:39,340
I'm not sure I get it.

567
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,690
Tell me again.

568
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:46,460
What if someone sees us?

569
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,710
No one's here.

570
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,890
We can just do this.

571
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,810
♫ The moment I hold your hand ♫

572
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:03,480
♫ Everything that was heavy in front of me seems to become lighter ♫

573
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,640
It's nice if this is how it feels to run.

574
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,320
Then,

575
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,210
I'll try running again.

576
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,650
- Okay.
- This time...

577
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,970
at full speed.

578
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,100
What? At full speed?

579
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,490
W-Why are you laughing? I barely mustered up the courage to say that.

580
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,500
Are you upset with me?

581
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,990
I still don't get it.

582
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,940
What don't you get?

583
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,400
A US congresswoman?

584
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,490
Tae Ha managed to get such a connection?

585
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,530
Yes. She is a US congresswoman who is ethnically Korean.

586
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,620
It appears CEO Lee Mi Dam connected them.

587
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,910
Everything that Lee Mi Dam does is so annoying.

588
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,630
I think so, too.

589
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,540
In any case, what do we do?

590
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,940
I don't think we should leave Kang Tae Ha like this.

591
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,300
Excuse me, CEO?

592
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,470
We can't leave things like this.

593
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:13,480
I must definitively take care of Tae Ha, so he can't do anything.

594
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,860
No matter what it takes.

595
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,790
You said, no matter what it takes. Right?

596
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,290
Ha Na, you're prepared for the interview with the congresswoman. Right?

597
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,520
Yes, should I print it out and give it to you?

598
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,110
I'm sure you did a great job, Ha Na.

I have to go to a department head meeting right now,

600
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,650
so please deliver it to Yeon Woo for me, Ha Na.

601
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,820
Yeon Woo will be here soon. I'll leave you to it.

Thank you.

605

But why did you ask to see me here?

606
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,350
The person who did that to your clothes at the first-anniversary event...

607
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,150
was me.

608
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,040
The design leak and the problem with the models. That was all me.

609
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,500
Pardon?

610
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,320
I wanted to be by Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha's side.

611
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,240
I worked hard, and I was confident I could do it.

612
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,610
Until you appeared, Park Yeon Woo.

613
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,700
Did you do that over mere jealousy?

614
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:34,120
It turns out a person's heart can turn into hell just over something like that.

615
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,450
I'm sorry about that.

616
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,410
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

617
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,650
You won't be seeing me like this any longer.

618
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,380
I will be quitting the company soon.

619
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,890
So you will run away like that?

620
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,320
Don't you feel bad for other people?

621
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,790
They had faith in you.

622
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,370
You were all on the same team.

623
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,710
Stay here and pay them back

doing everything you can, Ha Na.

625
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,700
Then, I will consider whether I will forgive you or not.

626
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:32,240
Please tell us what concept you had while designing the attire for the two of them.

627
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,350
The concept of this attire was something that would remind the Korean-American

628
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,910
Congresswoman of the hanbok she wore in her childhood—

Finally, you're looking at me.

No, I'm not good.

00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,890
Why do you keep interrupting?

641
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,910
It would be good for us if I do well.

It's okay. You are perfect as you are.

Is there a school in new Joseon that teaches you how to talk slick?

Come on, play with me! I'm bored.

- Go away!
- Gosh, play with me!

- Happy now?
- Too short. Do it longer.

654

What did you do? Do it longer because that was too short!

655

- Do it one more time!

00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,430
What are you saying?

720
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:45,500
I guess we'll find out what I'm saying once the drug left in this syringe is analyzed.

721
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,250
Isn't that right, Director Hwang?

722
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,970
I-I'm really sorry.

723
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:56,290
CEO Min told me to take care of you, no matter what it takes.

724
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,000
What?

725
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,280
I'm really sorry. Forgive me just this once!

726
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,490
Everything you are saying is being recorded.

727
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,710
Will you still admit it?

728
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,890
Oh, yes. I admit it.

729
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:12,490
All I did was do what CEO Min told me to do.

730
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,660
Hwang Myeong Soo, are you crazy?

731
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,590
I don't know anything. I don't know anything about this.

732
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,000
How about you tell them at the police station?

733
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,540
Oh, right. I also filed an injunction against you for a suspension of duty as CEO,

734
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:30,180
so keep that in mind, CEO Min Hye Sook.

735
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,710
Hey, CEO.

736
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:56,020
When did I ever tell you to do that? When did I ever!

737
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,410
You said to do whatever it takes.

738
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,000
I thought that was what you meant.

739
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,300
Who the hell are you?

740
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,450
Crazy bastard.

741
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:21,470
Min Hye Sook is much weaker than expected.

742
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,370
[CEO Min Hye Sook]

743
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,340
Oh, no... how could this be...

744
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,270
I'm sorry. Get up!

745
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,780
Let's hurry up and go...

746
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,300
Let's go. Wake up...

747
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,540
Chairman Kang...

748
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,560
you're next, for real...

749
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,800
How did it go?

750
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,370
Everything's over now.

751
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,610
CEO Min...

752
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:27,530
will soon be summoned by the police.

753
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,890
That's a relief.

754
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:34,060
Then, everything will return to its rightful place.

755
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,030
Mother's diary, too...

756
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,190
and the past ill-fated connections will be broken.

757
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,950
They will.

758
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,790
What is it?

759
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,600
Should I tell you an interesting story?

760
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,240
Please stop.

761
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,420
If you committed a crime, receive your just due punishment.

762
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,180
Crime?

763
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,680
What did I do that was so wrong?

764
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:16,170
Have you already forgotten what you did 23 years ago at the annex?

765
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,950
Do you really...

766
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:24,730
Do you really think that I killed Seo Yoon Hee?

767
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,070
It's too bad.

768
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,900
That wasn't me.

769
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,660
The person who killed Seo Yoon Hee...

770
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,940
was your grandfather.

771
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,700
How could you say such a ridiculous thing?

772
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,810
The one who locked up your mom in the annex

773
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,710
and the one who made her die there

774
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,150
was all Chairman Kang.

775
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,300
Are you mad, Min Hye Sook?

776
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,200
Chairman Kang made a deal with your father...

777
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,880
to fix Seo Yoon Hee's heart ailment by marrying me.

778
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,030
Because he needed my father's company and me for SH!

779
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,810
In that room where there isn't even that much light,

780
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,520
Seo Yoon Hee was there all by herself for several months.

781
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:30,080
And that day, you found out that your mother was locked up in the annex.

782
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,330
You were so little...

783
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,250
and you went to see your mom secretly.

784
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,850
That's when something happened.

785
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:49,690
[23 years ago]

786
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:03,880
What do you mean? Lock the door?

787
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,530
Yoon Hee's condition hasn't been good all day.

788
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,940
What can we do? It's Chairman's order.

789
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,390
Father...

790
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,310
I can't do that.

791
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,890
If we leave her like that, she may die.

792
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:19,430
- It's Chairman's orders!
- Director!

793
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,760
Don't you understand what that means?

794
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,440
You couldn't open the door from the inside if you locked it from the outside of that room.

795
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:46,350
Nobody could have imagined that you were in that room.

796
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,790
You were so young...

797
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,210
and banged on the door, asking for help.

798
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,820
Help!

799
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,710
Is anyone out there?

800
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,180
Help!

801
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,750
So are you saying she died or what?

802
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,400
And then, he framed me for it.

803
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,340

804
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:27,460
But still, I tried to help you!

805
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:33,200
You know very well how Chairman Kang raised you.

806
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:38,640
In his dead son's place, he had you in the palm of his hand and used you like a puppet.

807
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,740
Isn't that so?

808
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,100
Isn't that so?

809
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,170
No...

810
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:48,840
