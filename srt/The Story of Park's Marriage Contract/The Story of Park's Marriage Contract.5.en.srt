Park Yeon Woo.

Park Yeon Woo. Park Yeon Woo.

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,910
Park Yeon Woo, wake up. Park Yeon Woo.

00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,240
Deputy CEO!

7
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
Park Yeon Woo. Park Yeon Woo!

8
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,150
Gosh, what is taking her so long?

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,440
Who is that?

10
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,030
My Lady?

11
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,300
- Please make way.
- What happened?

12
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,890
Excuse me.

13
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,730
My Lady! My Lady!

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,820
Gosh, what do we do?

15
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,050
My Lady, are you okay?

16
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,120
Please wake up!

17
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,290
But how do you know Ms. Yeon Woo?

18
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,170
What did you do—

19
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,960
Why is My Lady like this? Why is she like this!

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,400
I-I don't know anything.

21
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,040
Who did it?

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,310
I asked you who did this!

23
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,310
- Deputy CEO! Deputy CEO!
- Tell me!

24
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,980
Stop it, both of you!

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,050
Take her outside quietly.

26
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,160
Okay.

27
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,410
My Lady...

28
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,830
No, I really came from Joseon.

29
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,580
Husband...

30
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,980
My father's family home is in Hamyang, and his name is Park Jae Won.

31
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,560
I told you. I grew up like a princess as the daughter of a nobleman.

32
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,150
I really do not know...

33
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,070
why I came here...

34
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,110
and how I can return...

35
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,710
Why am I here—

36
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,960
Are you awake now?

37
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,200
Excuse me.

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
This is not the first time we've met. Right?

39
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,560
What are you saying? I haven't seen your face before.

40
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,530
Did you dream or something?

41
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,110
Where—? Where do we go?

42
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,720
Gosh, that was so close.

43
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,220
This is bad.

44
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,010
What is he saying...

45
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,000
This is a proposal regarding SH Seoul's first-anniversary event.

46
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,430
I already received this proposal from Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha.

47
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,400
I know. This is something I prepared separately.

48
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,910
I would like you to consider which proposal is more fitting for Midam.

49
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,860
Does Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha know about this, too?

50
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,250
I'm the CEO of SH Seoul.

51
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,230
I see.

52
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,770
I guess since SH is a big company, you must have a different system.

53
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,790
I think a proposal like this would cause misunderstandings.

54
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,320
You need to do whatever it takes to get results.

55
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,210
I am saying that's how much I need Midam.

56
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,290
So you can keep Deputy CEO Kang in check?

57
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,100
I'll need to have lunch with the directors.

58
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,440
Just hold on for a little bit.

59
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,030
Did you get hurt there because of me?

60
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,410
It's all right. It's nothing.

So, why did you go to the forest?

He wouldn't believe me about Cheon Myeong, right?

68
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,050
I went out to get some fresh air because it was stuffy.

What is that forest?

70
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,370
There was a tombstone there. Is someone living there?

71
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,320
No. There are no roads there, and it's dangerous there.

72
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,410
So, don't ever go there by yourself.

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,670
Lady, wake up.

78
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,820
My Lady.

79
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,210
Sa Wol?

80
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,190
Sa Wol? What the...

81
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,800
Are we in Joseon? We're in Joseon!

82
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,290
- No, we're not.
- What do you mean, Joseon?

83
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,580
You said you don't even know the way back.

84
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,790
I just thought that because I suddenly saw your face.

85
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,850
Are you feeling better?

86
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,770
Some bandit-looking guy was carrying you on his back.

87
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,840
Do you know how scared I was?

88
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,680
Bandit? Not a handsome scholar?

89
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,400
Oh, not the Young Master.

90
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,610
There was a bandit with muscular arms next to him.

91
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,340
Oh, Mr. Hong? Mr. Hong carried me back?

92
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,550
Gosh, so I'm asking you, what happened?

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,850
I think I found a way to go back.

94
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,180
Deputy CEO Kang got married?

95
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,430
Married? What do you mean?

96
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,010
What do you mean by that?

97
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,800
CEO Min, with whom and when did he get married?

98
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,590
More importantly, Chairman is trying to promote Deputy CEO Kang to be the CEO of SH Seoul.

99
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,990
Since he's married now.

100
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,010
I mean, what connection is there between Deputy CEO Kang's marriage and the CEO position?

101
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,010
I know, right?

102
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,210
It's not like the company is a wedding gift.

103
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,660
How does this make any sense?

104
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,580
What is he thinking?

105
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,940
I'm a bit late.

106
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,020
So, did everyone eat?

107
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,960
Why is nobody congratulating me when my grandson got married?

108
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,580
Oh, congratulations!

109
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,020
Oh, sit, sit.

110
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,710
Chairman, let me ask you one thing.

111
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,490
Are you thinking of making Deputy CEO Kang the CEO of SH Seoul because he got married?

112
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,770
If that's the case, you can't do that.

113
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,590
As expected of Director Go.

114
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,320
You say what you need to say directly. Good, good.

115
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,170
What I'm saying is that if Deputy CEO Kang handles this business with Midam,

116
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,220
then we should consider it then.

117
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,560
Isn't that right, CEO Min?

118
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,280
I see. I think I misunderstood. All right.

119
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,570
Then, we will go over this issue according to the procedure after the first-anniversary event.

120
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,450
If necessary, that is.

121
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,110
Yeah. According to the procedure, of course.

122
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,140
We should do it according to procedure.

123
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,520
Go ahead and eat up.

124
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,970
Stop it. Stop being on your phone and do some work!

125
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,440
- Gosh, let's just take one picture together.
- Stop—

126
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,390
Gosh, Ha Na, you're eating a sandwich again?

127
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,240
If you work during lunch, you'll get a penalty from now on!

128
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,070
Seok Joo, let's just collect 10,000 won from each person.

129
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,070
10,000 won, okay.

130
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,620
Yes, this is Yoo Ha Na of SH Seoul.

131
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,720
Hello, this is Do Yoon Jae of Midam.

132
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,510
Manager Do?

133
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,180
Midam... Midam?

134
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,480
You're rejecting our proposal?

135
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,880
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,670
And thank you for making the proposal.

137
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,700
- Goodbye, then.
- Manager Do, Manager Do!

138
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,330
Why? Did Midam say they won't do it?

139
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,270
What do we do? The event is right around the corner.

140
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,350
I'll go see the Deputy CEO for a bit.

141
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,160
Ha Na.

142
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,880
This is driving me crazy.

143
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,330
Team Leader, we must do this with Midam. Right?

144
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,930
What will happen to our Deputy CEO if this doesn't work out?

145
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,660
He'll be so screwed.

146
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,610
CEO Min won't just let him be.

147
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,420
How about reconsidering it?

148
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,320
Deputy CEO Kang's offer was actually pretty good.

149
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,350
It's too bad, but what can I do?

150
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,580
I already made up my mind.

151
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,290
All right.

152
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,770
Deputy CEO, I have something to report.

153
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,450
A wound...

154
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,070
What is it, Yoo Ha Na?

155
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,420
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,820
I asked what you're doing here.

157
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,230
Oh, Midam called.

158
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,390
I thought you needed to know urgently, but Secretary Hong wasn't here.

159
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,000
So? What about Midam?

160
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,320
They say they will reject our offer.

161
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,720
Reject our offer?

162
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,080
Yes. But I'm thinking of persuading them one more time.

163
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,700
Okay. You may leave.

164
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,460
Oh, also...

165
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,510
Next time, no matter how urgent it is, please report to me through Secretary Hong.

166
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,850
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

167
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,090
Deputy CEO.

168
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,110
Chairman is here.

169
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,900
What happened to your face?

170
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,240
Did you get into a fight with your wife?

171
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,280
No, I just got scratched somewhere.

172
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,060
Really?

173
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,020
You know, you should send Yeon Woo back to Italy.

174
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,260
- Italy?
- The directors...

175
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,030
found out about your marriage.

176
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,310
It appears your mother told them.

177
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,150
What? Are you afraid?

178
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,210
If you want to become the owner of SH, you should be able to take care of at least this much.

179
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,750
Tae Ha,

180
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,340
power doesn't allow for a void.

181
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,500
There will be so much talk amongst the directors.

182
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,840
You should just send Yeon Woo back instead of having her suffer.

183
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,520
That is best for everyone.

184
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,140
Just a bit... Just a bit slower!

185
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,000
Gosh, why are you saying Cheon Myeong is on the mountain behind the house?

186
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,500
What drove you to go up to the mountain in the middle of the night?

187
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,860
- You sure you weren't hallucinating?
- I definitely saw her.

188
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,200
If I meet Cheon Myeong, I should be able to find a way to return to Joseon.

189
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,400
Well, I think the answer lies in you getting married again to the Young Master

190
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,080
of this house who looks exactly like your late husband, My Lady.

191
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,850
What do you mean?

192
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,300
It means you can return to Joseon if you get what you want.

193
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,290
What do you think that would be?

194
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,870
It is you and Young Master's first night together.

195
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,400
First night.

196
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,760
First night...

197
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,950
Oh, the first night.

198
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,860
First night?

199
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,620
What could you possibly want when you grew up with everything you needed?

200
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,850
But you didn't even get to have your first night, and even got kidnapped.

201
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,380
So, there's just one thing you could be missing.

202
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,350
A steamy night with...

203
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,430
your husband.

204
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,440
Forget it! Steamy night?

205
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,890
But did nothing really happen between you two?

206
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,680
I mean, if an adult man and woman live together in one house,

207
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,470
then, you know,

208
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,330
you guys can hold hands like this,

209
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,060
or accidentally graze lips... like this, you know.

210
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,160
or accidentally graze lips... like this, you know.

211
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,700
These lips of yours! Lips, my foot.

212
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,810
Did something happen?

213
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,160
Something did happen! There was something. Right?

214
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,340
There is. There is something I have to do!

215
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,410
- Let's hurry up and go.
- What is it?

216
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,900
[Humanities Department, Student Union, Central Library, Changgonggwan, ROTC]

217
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:33,640
Park Jae Won was a very famous scholar in the late Joseon period.

218
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,310
His father, Park Hyeon, was also a famous scholar of his time.

219
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,830
That family was a very prestigious family.

220
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,640
Do you have any more data on his daughter, Park Yeon Woo?

221
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,920
Oh, I don't know. All that's left is her name.

222
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,490
But I can do a bit more research.

223
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:59,400
Is Hwanghwa-bang, where Park Jae Won lived, close to where the Grand Seoul Hotel is now?

224
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,880
The Grand Seoul Hotel...

225
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,020
Since Howondang is around here,

226
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,630
well, I guess it would be in a similar location.

227
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,900
Howondang?

228
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,090
His father, Park Hyeon's younger brother, is Ho Won.

229
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:19,990
So, at the time, people used to call Park Jae Won's estate Howondang.

230
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,520
After you and I enter, Ms. Yeon Woo pops out.

231
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,870
There is no prior footage where she jumps into the pool, either.

232
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,620
Also, about the crepe-myrtle tree at the swimming pool...

233
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,550
Supposedly, it's never properly blossomed before.

234
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:51,710
But the day Ms. Yeon Woo appeared, it blossomed completely.

235
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,640
Also, this is just my opinion, but I think that Sa Wol...

236
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,440
also came from Joseon as well.

237
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,970
That's probably true, seeing her reaction yesterday.

238
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,110
How could they come from Joseon? No way!

239
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,520
How is Sa Wol at the Chairman's house?

240
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,260
Come on. Is this for real? How does this make sense?

241
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,950
Why are you so excited?

242
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,870
I'm educating Tae Ha's wife on how to run a household.

243
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,580
Household education? You, Aunt?

244
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,720
Hey, I was the wife of the firstborn son of a household!

245
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,300
You know, Father and Tae Ha are shielding her so much.

246
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,080
She should know who the boss is from the get-go. Our family isn't ordinary, you know.

247
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
It's an extraordinarily messed up family.

248
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,040
Aunt, what should I do first?

249
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,180
Give it to me.

250
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,840
What is this?

251
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,580
This house has so much money,

252
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,370
so why do they do laundry like this?

253
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,800
Anyway, whether it's Joseon or new Joseon,

254
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,590
the rich people are more stingy. So annoying.

255
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,190
What is this?

256
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,000
Are you talking about me?

257
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,210
Goodness, I'm so forgetful! I forgot I left the teapot on the stove!

258
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,490
I should hurry on over there.

259
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,580
Sa Wol,

260
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,350
do you remember when Grandfather told us about the island called Jeju-do?

261
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,280
He said it's a big island

262
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,990
but it's lonely because it's alone by itself.

263
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:47,930
I felt like I was like that island in this new Joseon.

264
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,370
But...

265
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,480
I think he feels the same way.

266
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,290
It's funny, right?

267
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:04,010
How I'm thinking of that Jeju-do here when I've never been there.

268
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,930
What are you doing here?

269
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,980
I was just watching you.

270
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,390
You who came from Joseon, Park Yeon Woo.

271
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,440
Thank you.

272
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,910
For believing me.

273
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,510
Thank you so much.

274
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,780
Park Yeon Woo, I feel a bit uncomfortable.

275
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm sorry. I was so happy that I couldn't help myself.

276
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,560
Are you that happy?

277
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,960
I am happy! You finally believe me, Trickster Guy.

278
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,620
Let's make one thing clear.

279
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,360
I admit that you may have come from Joseon.

280
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,040
However, there still isn't enough evidence to prove 100% that you came from Joseon. So—

281
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,520
I've told you many times already. I am definitely from Joseon.

282
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,050
The place where we first met was my home called Howondang,

283
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,690
and I came from there.

284
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,100
At the time, people used to call Park Jae Won's estate Howondang.

285
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,490
Howondang?

286
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,670
That is right. My grandfather's younger brother was Ho Won.

287
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,540
So please just stop arguing with me!

288
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,510
So what I mean is—

289
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:15,300
♫ Although I look at you again and again, why do I talk faster ♫

290
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,970
♫ repeat myself, and feel out of breath? ♫

291
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,620
♫ repeat myself, and feel out of breath? ♫

292
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:29,920
♫ I keep wanting to walk with you, and as I walk, I end up smiling ♫

293
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:37,620
♫ When I laugh along with you, it all feels like a dream ♫

294
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,100
Look.

295
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,310
Rain is falling from the ground.

296
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:51,500
♫ You don't know that now that I'm next to you
I wish that time would stop ♫

297
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,370
Do you like it that much?

298
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,010
♫ Oh, my heart ♫

299
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:03,260
♫ The reason I only look at you, the reason I smile with you ♫

300
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,420
♫ It's good, but is there a reason? ♫

301
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,200
♫ I can't explain it, all because of you ♫

302
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,380
♫ You're the reason for everything ♫

303
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:27,470
♫ The reason why I keep smiling even when there is a breeze ♫

304
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,180
♫ The reason I was born ♫

305
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,660
Gosh, you scared me!

306
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,780
Stay still.

307
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,190
They're looking good together right now.

308
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,320
♫ I know all the answers. Please tell me quickly ♫

309
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,840
The Deputy CEO just smiled!

310
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,630
Are you laughing right now or crying?

311
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:59,700
♫ Smile at me, too ♫

312
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,730
If Midam opens in an SH branch in New York,

313
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,750
it can make 67% more profit.

314
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,680
I'm sorry. Numbers like that aren't what's important for us.

315
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,590
Yes, numbers don't mean much.

316
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:23,870
But people assess everything, like brand value and sales, in numbers.

317
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,180
It's a win-win opportunity for both SH and Midam.

318
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,700
Please consider it once more.

319
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,200
I can't win with you, Deputy Yoo.

320
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,230
I'll bring it up one more time with the CEO.

321
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,640
Thank you!

322
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,020
Thank you so much!

323
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,500
I heard Chairman met with Deputy CEO Kang.

324
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,010
It appears something big is about to blow up.

325
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,540
That won't be enough.

326
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,980
Make this a bigger issue by getting Yeon Woo involved.

327
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,200
Make it seem like Tae Ha's marriage itself has a problem.

328
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,910
Issue? What issue?

329
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,330
You're telling me to create rumors!

330
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,180
How?

331
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,580
Is that big head of yours just for decoration?

332
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,930
I'll try to rack this big head of mine.

333
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,290
But I don't think Deputy CEO Kang would just let things slide easily.

334
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,370
This war has already started.

335
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,010
It will only end when one of us falls down there.

336
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,850
CEO Min is someone who would resort to anything if she makes up her mind.

337
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,940
You know that, right?

338
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,430
I'll handle the situation with Yeon Woo on my own, Grandfather.

339
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,470
When did new Joseon's night view

340
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,190
become this sparkly and beautiful?

341
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,540
Only time has passed,

342
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,000
and yet, it's so different from Joseon.

343
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,930
You know, you should send Yeon Woo back to Italy.

344
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,720
That is best for everyone.

345
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,450
Don't forget about our promise.

346
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,640
The promise you made about helping me return to Joseon.

347
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,520
I saw a strange illusion

348
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,570
of you in Joseon.

349
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,750
Are you saying you saw me while I was in Joseon.

350
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,040
At first, I tried my best to understand what that was,

351
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,900
but forget it now.

352
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,680
That's not what's important.

353
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:32,300
I will... keep my promise.

354
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,570
While you are here, I'll help you, Yeon Woo.

355
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,070
So, don't worry.

356
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,690
This is a fraudulent marriage.

357
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,590
How can you say you're a man when you are sterile!

358
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,710
- Crazy.
What did you say?

359
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,000
- This bitch!
- Do you want to lose

360
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,850
Father's wealth to the Young Master?

361
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,200
Crazy dramas are entertaining.

362
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,070
Something happens, bam! Tension, bam! Don't you think so, Oppa?

363
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,900
Hey, what do you think about someone from Joseon?

364
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,220
Did you read web novels again? A time-slip historical drama this time?

365
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,330
It's real life that seems more fictional than a novel,

366
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,510
but the problem is, that person from Joseon is...

367
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,140
pretty.

368
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,200
Very pretty...

369
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:32,420
What are you saying? Just eat this and wake up, you maniac!

370
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,260
Okay. I should wake up.

371
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,090
Both me and my Deputy CEO.

372
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,010
What is that?

373
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,330
It got dirty, so I'm going to throw it out.

374
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,580
A steamy first night with your husband.

375
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,080
First night. First night.

376
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,200
That's not true!

377
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,820
W-What are you talking about?

378
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,400
Oh, I know, right? Gosh.

379
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,780
First night! First night! First night! First night! First night!

380
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,400
Sa Wol, that little...

381
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,410
Please hear my prayer, Buddha, the Great Jade Emperor, God of Heaven and Earth.

382
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:58,490
Please let My Lady have a great first night after taking this,

383
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,240
so we can go back to Joseon already.

384
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,070
Gosh, it's so hot.

385
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,660
Hello, Team Leader.

386
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,820
Did you hear, Deputy Yoo?

387
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,160
The newbie who's coming today. Kang Tae Min.

388
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,530
He's CEO Min's second son. Right?

389
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,830
Yes.

390
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,690
Is our marketing team the nepotism band from hell?

391
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,770
Is it the gathering place for the royal family?

392
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,070
What can we do? It's the decision of the higher-ups.

393
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,730
We're to treat him as an ordinary employee.

394
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,610
How could we do that?

395
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,710
Who doesn't know he's the owner's son?

396
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,260
Hello.

397
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,960
I am Kang Tae Min, and I will be working here starting today.

398
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,560
Hello. I am... I mean...

399
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,820
I'm Team Leader Oh Hyeon Jeong of the marketing team.

400
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,340
Good morning! Gosh, my throat.

401
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,150
Hi, I'm the new employee here. I'm Kang Tae Min.

402
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,590
I look forward to working with you, Senior.

403
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,990
Junior! Junior!

404
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,000
But if you're Kang Tae Min, your name is similar to our Deputy CEO...

405
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,280
Kang Tae Ha. Kang Tae Min...

406
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,050
I guess there is an employee who doesn't know.

407
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,030
You're right.

408
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,070
K-Kang Dro.

409
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,890
Our Deputy CEO got married?

410
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,110
When? With whom?

411
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,930
I just found out now, too!

412
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,560
Oh my god.

413
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,970
The vibe seems a bit off right now.

414
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,820
It feels strangely cold.

415
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,320
Deputy CEO.

416
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,110

419
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,740
I guess you're more afraid of me than I thought.

420
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,810
You are being excessively self-conscious.

421
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,930
What you did today was a mistake.

422
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,130
Do you know how I made SH what it is today?

423
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,820
It would be shameless to just ask me to hand it to you.

424
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,640
Is the company a toy that we would give or take it?

425
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,820
That's why you can't win, CEO Min.

426
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,740
As for that,

427
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,290
we shall see about that.

428
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,820
This is what President Min gave me when Tae Min's mom got married,

429
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,180
asking me to take good care of his daughter.

430
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,580
That guy cared so much about his daughter.

431
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,330
This is more valuable than it seems.

432
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,310
There's much talk amongst the directors.

433
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,780
I'm worried that the rumors about Deputy CEO Kang's marriage

434
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,730
won't disappear easily.

435
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,390
Not only that...

436
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,440
What? Tell me. It's fine.

437
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,600
There are also rumors about how our business with Midam will not work out,

438
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,730
so many are voicing their concerns.

439
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:11,580
From what I hear, CEO Min Hye Sook met with Midam separately.

440
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,940
It's clear that CEO Min sure learned how to do business well.

441
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,440
Compared to her, Tae Ha is still just a kid.

442
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,990
What should I do?

443
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:29,510
What? Even if someone's good at their work and is useful,

444
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,780
you need to get rid of them if they get in the way.

What can you do?

446
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,520
Wait! Wait! You can't do this.

447
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,030
No, you can't. Gosh!

448
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,440
Deputy CEO, I'm sorry.

00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,860
I thought I should at least say hello since it's my first day at work.

451
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,530
Okay.

452
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,580
Wow, this is unexpected.

453
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,350
I thought I would be the first to be in the tabloid news.

454
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,420
What are you going to do about Sister-in-law Mourning Clothes?

455
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,060
It has nothing to do with you, so mind your own business.

456
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,110
I see...

457
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:19,110
Are you saying this is nothing since it's a fake marriage?

458
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,240
Is that it?

459
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,670
What?

460
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,120
Were you surprised?

461
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,300
How could I not know what CEO Min knows?

What are you trying to say?

463
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,900
I suppose it's a warning.

00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,520
Excuse me.

00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,870
- Did he really ask you for directions?
- Yes, he did.

474
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,010
But I don't know the geography of this area at all, so...

475
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,900
What is this?

476
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,430
This is so ridiculous.

477
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,710
I'll tell you the directions next time for sure!

Yes, Ha Na went through a lot to personally go to Midam and persuade them.

You've done well. You deserve a lot of credit, Deputy Yoo.

No, I just did what I should do.

No thanks.

00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,210
A word, please!

525
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,240
Wait, just a sec!

526
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,840
Please do not take photos.

527
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,360
Please do not take photos.

Please move back.

Come here.

530
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,220
Oh, Kang Dro really got married.

531
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,680
But what's with the female partner?

532
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,500
You sure it's not a fake rumor?

[Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha]

534
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,130
Something's wrong these days. Right?

535
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,000
I sent the files to the American doctor who performed your heart surgery,

536
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,180
and there seems to be a problem with your blood vessels. Let's get you examined first.

537
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,150
Next time. I can't do it right now.

538
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,130
Kang Tae Ha! It's about the heart, your heart!

539
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,500
You're in danger, man!

540
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,810
This time, I can't let it slide, either.

541
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,930
If you keep this up, I'll tell the chairman about your condition.

542
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,390
What is most dangerous and revolting to me

543
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,750
is that woman CEO Min will use my heart condition...

544
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,410
for her own devious purposes.

545
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,160
Just like she did to my mother.

546
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,540
Crazy bastard.

547
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,810
These are vasodilators. Keep them on you.

548
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:23,420
In return, we will have you examined, and that's that.

549
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,820
There must be a reason why Cheon Myeong appeared...

550
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,310
Also, the reason why this myrtle-crepe flower hasn't withered.

551
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,650
Gosh, whatever!

552
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:52,210
I heard that in new Joseon, you call this 'lit.'

00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,440
As always, you're the best, Sa Wol.

554
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,290
Stop getting excited prematurely.

555
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,840
Why do you think I'm here?

556
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,840
Because the eldest Young Master asked me to take care of you, My Lady.

557
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,180
Really? The Trickster Guy?

558
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,830
So, make sure to eat all these.

559
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,180
I added all sorts of medicinal ingredients that are good for you into this,

560
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,620
so eat all of them.

561
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,780
That way, you'll feel energized to have your first night with him

If you say stuff like that, leave. Leave, and stop this.

00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,860
Wait, your hair.

00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,270
Wait, this is...

00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,240
Oh, my.

567
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,180
- Did you do some sewing?
- Yeah.

568
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,110
I had a lot on my mind, so I thought I should torture my body a bit.

569
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,830
Will you keep wasting your energy on other things?

570
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,400
Driving me crazy, seriously.

571
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,760
What is that?

572
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,700

Oh, my goodness!

So this is a department store I've seen only on TV.

579
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,090

Though his body is a bit lacking, he's quite set with money.

No, his body is quite nice, too. I got a glimpse last time.

583
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,230
No, his body is quite nice, too. I got a glimpse last time.

There were also pictures on the bulletin board.

642

Also, complain about the slow progress on the partnership with Midam.

Yes, got it.

644

00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:55,020

650
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,180
What? Is there a problem with me coming to my own place?

00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,730
Today is the board meeting. Right?

652
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:36,350
This, this, this was him intentionally barging in. Right?

653
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,050
This will definitely be a good opportunity for Midam, too.

654
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,090
It's not an exhibit for just an event,

655
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:52,980
but I want to create a vision with Midam.

656
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,770
Your proposal was...

657
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,930
quite interesting.

658
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,830
However, I've already made up my mind.

659
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,880
May I ask you why?

660
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,290
Not too long ago,

661
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:16,530
CEO Min Hye Sook visited me with another proposal.

662
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:20,510
That is something I can explain to you.

663
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,780
I make clothes, so...

664
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,600
I feel uncomfortable getting involved in things like that.

665
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,890
I don't believe in all the rumors,

666
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,960
but I can't help that it bothers me.

667
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,970
Thank you for your offer.

668
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,980
I'm sorry.

669
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,190
CEO Lee.

670
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,780
I'm sorry, Deputy CEO! Are you okay?

671
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,920
It's all right.

672
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,090
CEO!

673
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:15,900
Just once. Please reconsider just one more time.

674
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,980
Midam's hanbok, the value of clothes, your philosophy, CEO...

675
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,680
We won't tarnish them. I promise you.

676
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,390
I understand your intentions,

677
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,590
but no.

678
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:31,880
CEO, I beg of you.

679
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,490
Mother!

680
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:03,030
Mother...

681
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,150
Yeon Woo.

682
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,130
Mother...

683
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,250
Mother...

684
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,510
The rumors about Deputy CEO Kang have spread to the merchandisers as well.

685
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,260
Everyone's in an uproar, asking if this isn't the owner's risk!

686
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,340
The PR team is unable to do its job because the reporters keep calling!

687
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,190
And he's not even explaining himself in this situation.

688
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,990
It's so frustrating, geez.

689
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:57,820
Director Oh, Director Kim, everyone, let's calm down.

690
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,740
Don't you think Deputy CEO Kang has a plan?

691
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:05,270
How about we just announce the marriage and do an interview, Chairman?

692
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,410
Isn't the timing important?

693
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,080
How are we going to handle this?

694
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,240
What do we do?

695
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,540
- Oh, he's here.
- He should tell us.

696
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,200
You should stop now.

697
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,520
Deputy CEO Kang will explain for himself.

698
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:25,770
First, I apologize for causing such a ruckus because of a personal matter.

699
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,480
However, the rumors are baseless and false.

00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,460
I mean, where there's smoke, there's fire.

701
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,650
It can't be spontaneous combustion. It is a fact that you got married.

702
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,430
Why did you make this into a bigger issue by hiding it?

703
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,330
Yes, marriage is a personal matter.

704
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,680
However, if it impacts the group, it's a different story.

705
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,460
Please explain yourself, whether it's a false rumor or not.

706
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,380
- That is—
- Now, now!

707
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,910
So?

708
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:53,930
So what is it that you all want to know?

709
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,300
What is it that you want to hear?

710
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:01,020
Chairman, we don't know

711
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,950
what problems may arise for the company because of Deputy CEO Kang.

712
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:07,140
The directors' worries are reasonable, too.

713
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,950
Deputy CEO Kang, answer with your own mouth.

714
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,750
Is there a problem with your marriage?

715
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,980
- Is it like the rumors?
- No.

716
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,060
That isn't true.

717
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,920
You all heard that. Right?

718
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,520
If anything goes wrong as a result of this,

719
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,650
I will be the first to demote him from Deputy CEO.

720
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,840
You all got that?

721
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,250
Deputy CEO Kang, just worry about the first-anniversary event,

722
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,090
so there's no unnecessary noise about it.

723
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:35,720
I heard that Midam rejected our offer.

724
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,290
Isn't that true, Deputy CEO Kang?

725
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,540
M-Midam rejected the offer—

726
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,570
Is that true?

727
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,870
And he spoke so confidently about it, too.

728
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,870
Look at the way he is handling business? Geez!

729
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:55,620
Goodness. I should've known.

730
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,910
Forget it, never mind.

731
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,690
Let's talk about that later.

732
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,460
Hello.

733
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,140
Have you been well, Chairman Kang Sang Mo?

734
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,970
Goodness, yes.

735
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:32,570
This is CEO Lee Mi Dam, who will be in charge of the first-anniversary opening exhibit.

736
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,630
I brought her because I wanted to personally introduce her.

737
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,110
Goodness.

738
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:40,420
I heard you rejected our proposal, so what brings you here?

739
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,750
I thought about doing so,

740
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,640
but Deputy CEO Kang gave me a magnificent gift.

741
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,030
Chairman, your granddaughter-in-law has a special talent.

742
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:55,050
Her embroidery skills are incredible.

743
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,050
If it's my granddaughter-in-law...

744
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,480
Granddaughter-in-law?

745
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,720
Isn't it that woman from the rumors?

746
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,400
Where did such rumors start from?

747
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,370
Really?

748
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,830
You met someone who looks exactly like Madam?

749
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,870
I really thought she was Mother.

750
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:19,210
I mean, why do we keep meeting people who look like people we know?

751
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,000
Sa Wol,

752
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,110
maybe this is...

753
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,980
Ms. Yeon Woo.

754
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,310
What is it?

755
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,110
This...

756
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,250
It's yours, right, Yeon Woo?

757
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,050
What is it?

758
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,750
You dropped it, and I'm only returning it to you now.

759
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:52,760
Oh, my, what's with the color? Why is it so black?

760
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,450
It wasn't like that at first, but it changed.

761
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,230
But isn't this silver?

762
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:01,310
Does silver change color if it touches water, too?

763
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,420
This spot had my husband's blood on it.

764
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,540
♫ The moment we ran into each other by chance ♫

765
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:30,400
♫ I remember you shining like a wave ♫

766
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:39,140
♫ As if I already knew, as if I had been waiting for it ♫

767
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,340
I want to work with you, Yeon Woo.

768
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,370
I don't know if I can do a good job since I came from Joseon.

769
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:47,310
Wherever you are, you are the one who makes the clothes.

770
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:49,200
I'm sure you will do well.

771
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,880
I look forward to working with you all!

772
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,230
She's really good at befriending people.

773
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:56,180
Separate a bit while you walk!

774
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,160
What a surprise. I didn't think you'd come into the company.

775
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,110
Won't this become dangerous for Yeon Woo as well?

776
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:04,710
I'll have to make sure CEO Min can't easily mess with her.

777
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,950
I wonder how far she can go.

778
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:10,770
You will soon see the true nature of fate repeating itself.

779
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,900
The end of a repeated relationship?
