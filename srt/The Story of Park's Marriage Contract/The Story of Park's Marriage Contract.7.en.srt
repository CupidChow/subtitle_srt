Keep adding this to Tae Ha's food until his wedding day.

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,690
Will you be all right doing this?

5
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,670
Who will suspect anything when a child with a heart condition suddenly dies?

6
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,330
This is the only way for me to get what I want.

7
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,710
I leave it to you.

[Episode 7 - A midsummer night's dream]

00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,410
You will soon see the true nature of fate repeating itself.

10
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,770
Deputy CEO!

11
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,300
Let's go.

12
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,590
You were my husband, I see.

13
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,450
Are you awake?

14
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,780
I'll bring you some water.

15
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,060
In that annex,

16
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,020
my mom died.

17
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,220
The one who locked my mom in there

18
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,860
and the one who left her to die there...

19
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,170
was that woman Min Hye Sook.

20
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,860
Bring back my mom!

21
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,340
Bring back my mom!

22
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,630
No. I didn't do it. It wasn't me!

23
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,800
Liar! I saw you!

24
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,900
- I saw it all!
- Really?

25
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,170
Then what did you do, Tae Ha?

26
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,620
After that day,

27
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,550
a big boulder was placed within me.

28
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,530
I endured the weight of that every day,

29
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,310
and was determined to never again...

30
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,030
let her take anything from me.

31
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,860
But in the end, I wasn't able to do anything again.

32
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,720
No.

33
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,340
That's not true.

34
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,770
You came all the way to a place like that to find me.

35
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,880
Things are all right now... because I came.

36
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,670
Since I am here.

37
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,300
That boulder.

38
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,430
I will pull it out of you.

39
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,660
No matter what it takes in this life.

40
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,690
No. It's okay.

41
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,570
Because... I'm not your husband, Yeon Woo.

42
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,960
I guess I look a lot like him.

43
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,300
I don't know what happened,

44
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,740
but you don't have to worry about me.

45
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,650
We should go inside now.

46
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,900
On the day we got married,

47
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,690
my husband died.

48
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,810
He did have a heart condition,

49
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,970
but he suddenly died.

50
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,350
So I'm worried...

51
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,980
that fate will repeat itself again.

52
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,030
- That you might end up like my husband, Tae Ha—
- That won't happen.

53
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,540
I am not him,

54
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,820
and I don't believe in fate.

55
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,020
On the day we got married, my husband died.

Thank you. Thank you.

63
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,890
I get such an appetite because of you, Sa Wol.

64
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,630
You actually did something right for once.

65
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,100
Where did you bring in such a good chef?

66
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,140
- Thank you, Chairman.
- Sure.

67
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,480
I may not have a good eye for men,

68
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,730
but I have a good eye for women.

69
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,730
Aunt, could you introduce me to a good oriental medicine clinic?

70
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,180
I want to get some herbal medicine for Tae Ha.

71
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,930
Herbal medicine?

72
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,960
What's going on? It's unusual of you to care for Tae Ha's well-being.

73
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,650
Did my dead brother appear in your dreams last night or something?

74
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,150
Did he tell you to take care of Tae Ha?

75
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,290
Mom, you should try some of this. It's delicious.

76
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,170
I was just worried.

77
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,220
I think Tae Ha collapsed in the annex yesterday.

78
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,230
No way. Why would Tae Ha be there?

79
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,460
It appears Yeon Woo went into the annex.

80
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,670
Yeon Woo? Why would she go in there?

81
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,410
I wouldn't know about that.

82
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,020
Should I get some herbal medicine for you, too, Father?

83
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,610
No, I'm good. Just get some for Tae Ha.

84
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,220
In any case, thanks.

85
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,390
Of course. It is what I should do.

86
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,840
It's withered even more.

87
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,030
This is a rare document, with very few in existence,

88
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,540
so I went through much trouble to find it.

89
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,760
This contains information on Park Yeon Woo?

90
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,820
Yes, this is a letter left behind by the Park family of Hamyang.

91
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,120
It is short, but there is information about Park Yeon Woo.

92
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,410
Park Jae Won's daughter, Park Yeon Woo,

93
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,060
received a memorial headstone for being a loyal wife.

94
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,400
Pardon?

95
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,480
L-Loyal Wife?

96
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,120
Yes, she was a young widow,

97
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,290
but such cases were rare even back then.

98
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,660
It appears there was much commotion over it.

99
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,360
A young widow?

100
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,400
That is what you call a widow whose husband dies on their wedding day.

101
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,800
After her husband died of illness,

102
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,710
Park Yeon Woo supposedly jumped into a well.

103
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,740
That very day?

104
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,930
Then, that norigae's color really changed because of poison?
(Hanbok accessory)

105
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,100
Then who killed your husband?

106
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,140
I think it was Mother-in-law.

107
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,440
Madam Yoon?

108
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,550
Wait! If the Young Master and your husband are like a past life reincarnated,

109
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,210
then the current madam is...

110
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,320
Tae Ha may be in danger.

111
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,560
My Lady, stop getting involved in this right away.

112
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,920
It is better not to go back to Joseon.

113
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,500
I'll make sure to take care of you, so just look the other way.

114
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,400
How could I do that when I know it already?

115
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
What if you get hurt, My Lady?

116
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,730
Why do you care so much about it when you—

117
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,040
By chance,

118
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,160
do you... like Young Master?

119
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,660
I do like—

120
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,790
What? Me?

121
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,980
Are you saying I like that Trickster Guy?

122
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,220
No way! What are you saying?

123
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,580
Gosh, if it's not true, it's not. Why are you getting all worked up for?

124
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,720
- It's suspicious.
- What's so suspicious?

125
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,660
It's because you keep saying strange things!

126
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,160
Forget it! I have to go back to work, so let's talk about this later.

127
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,470
I can smell it.

128
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,710
A fishy smell.

129
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,000
So...

130
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,970
Deputy CEO, I mean...

131
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,340
your friend wants to go out with Ms. Yeon Woo,

I mean, with some girl.

133
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,060
But that girl can't forget her ex-boyfriend.

134
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,750
So you don't know what will happen.

135
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,230
Is that right?

136
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,490
You hit it on the head.

137
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,670
My friend asked me about it, but this is not my area of specialty.

138
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,300
- Oh, your friend, Deputy CEO?
- Yeah, my friend...

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,390
Easy? What's so easy?

141
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,080
I mean, in any case, Ms. Yeon Woo—

142
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,500
I mean, that girl's ex-boyfriend isn't here.

143
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,230
What's the matter when the goalkeeper isn't even here?

144
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,390
Just go for it!

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,630
H-How do I just go for it?

146
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,090
What else? Just give her everything! Your body, heart, or presents!

147
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,710
It's so easy!

148
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,770
You see! It goes in!

149
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,600
- Just go for it...
- Yeah.

150
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,730

Yes. Someone gave it to me, but I don't like sweets.

Yes, Manager. The list of fabrics.

Ha Na, what is that pink thing?

164
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,060
This is such an expensive chocolate.

165

168

181
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,090
Then, what about the plan for making Tae Ha the CEO?

182
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,470
Since some time ago,

183
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,020
mites spread all over these flowerbeds.

184
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,130
They're so nasty that

185
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,650
they won't disappear, although I tried all sorts of things, like spraying pesticides.

186
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,810
So do you know what I did?

187
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,190
- I don't know.
- I just let them be.

188
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,390
So I can see if it becomes mite food or what else.

189
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,690
But these guys just died.

190
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,440
Do you have some other plan for Deputy CEO Kang?

191
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,290
I'm thinking about it.

192
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,940
Whether I should let him become mite food,

193
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,580
or if I should pull off the mites.

194
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,890
I like the Trickster Guy?

195
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,550
No way.

196
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,490
Team Leader Oh.

197
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,140
Did Designer Park Yeon Woo from Midam come to work today?

198
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,810
How is she? Supposedly, she's really pretty. Is that true?

199
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,970
Why are you so interested? Be quiet and leave.

200
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,470
Oh! Her, her!

201
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,720
I think it's her.

202
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,480
If you make me mad, I go crazy!

203
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,080
I'll count to three. One, two!

204
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,760
Let's go!

205
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,770
We're so busy as is.

206
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,640
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

207
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,700
Why would you be sorry? You didn't do anything wrong.

208
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,580
Though she didn't do anything wrong, she can still be a problem.

209
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,920
Just like now.

210
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,900
If it were me, I would use the time to apologize to work even harder.

211
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,880
Ha Na, what's wrong with you?

212
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,660
Yeon Woo, what Deputy Yoo means is—

213
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,400
Yes, okay!

214
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,980
I'll work really hard to make sure our first-anniversary event is a success!

215
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,660
All right! Let's do it!

216
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,900
Let's do it!

217
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,070
Let's do it!

218
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,530
I warned you to wrap it up well,

219
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,420
if you can't take responsibility for Mourning Clothes to the end.

220
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,630
Did you think everything would be resolved if you revealed she was your wife?

221
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,570
What's this? Did something happen to Yeon Woo?

222
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,110
Wow, you're so lucky.

223
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,760
You made a mess alone, yet you feel no burden.

224
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,970
I asked what's going on!

225
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,120
Is it CEO Min?

226
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,460
- Where is Yeon Woo right now?
- Forget it, just get lost.

227
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,570
Secretary Hong, find out where Park Yeon Woo is right now.

228
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,110
Okay.

229
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,610
Let go of me.

230
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,490
You'd better let go.

231
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,110
You should stop here.

232
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,400
You shouldn't get involved in this.

233
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,980
I've confirmed Ms. Yeon Woo's location.

234
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,440
Hey, Kang Tae Ha!

235
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,580
If you step in rashly, only Ms. Yeon Woo will face trouble.

236
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,350
Don't you know that?

237
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,930
I called you to have lunch together.

238
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:50,220
I am your mother-in-law, after all, but I don't think I cared for you enough.

239
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,530
I didn't think Tae Ha would go all the way to the annex.

240
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,220
Did you hear the story about Tae Ha's mom?

241
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,720
You called me there even though you knew that?

242
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,380
I was curious about how Tae Ha would react.

243
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,170
Even animals know compassion.

244
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,120
How could you have such disregard for his wounds?

245
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,160
You don't feel apologetic at all?

246
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,670
I'm not sure...

247
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,150
Why should I?

248
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,500
I didn't do anything wrong.

249
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,560
I guess there's no need for me to speak with you anymore, then.

250
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,330
You will know after time passes

251
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:38,460
that the wounds you cause last longer than the wounds you've received.

252
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,190
Here.

253
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,700
Take this.

254
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,480
It's good for your health.

255
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,810
Tae Ha was physically weak from his childhood because he took after his mom.

256
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,870
Why?

257
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,580
Are you worried it may contain poison or something?

258
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,230
Let's go.

259
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,650
You should at least mind your manners. We were talking.

260
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,100
Manners?

261
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,170
Then, you shouldn't have done that.

262
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,240
You sure you're not grateful?

263
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,850
Thanks to me, you managed to enter the annex.

264
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,750
You're right.

265
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,960
Thanks to you, nothing is standing in my way.

266
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,560
Look forward to it. Things are going to be different.

267
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,590
Nothing's standing in the way now?

268
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,360
We'll have to see to the end about that.

269
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,910
Are you okay? CEO Min didn't do anything to you. Right?

270
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,120
We only talked.

271
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,750
Why did you meet with her?

272
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,220
I mean, I didn't get to eat lunch yet...

273
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,010
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,080
I think it's been a while since I heard this sound.

275
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,340
I'm hungry.

276
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,160
You sure you're okay with just chocolate?

277
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,090
You don't need to eat food?

278
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,890
I'm fine. I wanted to eat this the most.

279
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,830
Is everything that easy for you, Yeon Woo?

280
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,320
Do you start liking things that quickly, just going when someone calls you?

281
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,900
Are you picking a fight with me?

282
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm worried about you.

283
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,320
Do you know how scared I was?

284
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,240
Why are you always so worried?

285
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,060
Am I a kid or something?

286
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,520
What?

287
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,150
You see! I can't take my eyes off you for one second.

288
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,160
So stay by my side, so I can always keep you in my sight.

289
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,290
♫ When I look at you for a while ♫

290
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:35,670
W-What are you saying? If someone hears you, they might think you like me!

291
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,340
I do like you.

292
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,470
♫ I wanted to run away from this unfamiliar feeling ♫

293
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,460
♫ I feel like such a fool ♫

294
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,760
♫ What if you and I met each other ♫

295
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,120
♫ under slightly different circumstances? ♫

296
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,830
♫ I like you, with just those words ♫

297
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,290
So stay by my side, so I can always keep you in my sight.

298
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,250
I do like you.

299
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,210
Gosh, so salty!

300
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,460
♫ ...the moment I see you ♫

301
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,930
So annoying!

302
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,340
Why do I have to do a manager's work, too, when I'm just a part-timer?

303
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,100
So? You're going to eat all of this?

304
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,250
You said you were going on a diet.

305
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,410
Don't bother me, Brother.

306
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,310
My current condition is 9,620 won!

307
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,760
9,620 won? What's that?

308
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,480
Minimum wage.

309
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,440
My condition is rock bottom!

310
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,060
I'll eat everything from tteokbokki to fish cake soup and corn cheese,

311
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,730
so make all that without anything missing, Brother. Okay?

312
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,890
Gosh, you're just using up your brother's precious weekend, aren't you?

313
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,690
Precious weekend, my foot.

314
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,290
You don't even have a girlfriend.

315
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,170
Tteokbokki is going to be so tasty—

316
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,900
Where did this guy go?

317
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,570
Brother!

318
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,500
Sa Wol.

319
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,210
What brings you to see me?

320
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,320
Homework.

321
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,840
We should do our homework.

322
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,970
By chance, will today be our first day going out?

323
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,840
Before that, let's take care of your young master and my lady.

324
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,730
Take care of them?

325
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,130
I mean, seeing those two keep teasing each other

326
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,790
without getting anywhere is so frustrating.

327
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:48,990
We should just slap those two together

328
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,840
and wrap them around each other like seaweed.

329
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,640
How?

330
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

331
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,400
Tell me one more time.

332
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,070
What is all this?

333
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,930
I heard you were working from home today, so I came to take care of you.

334
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,090
Oh, it's so aromatic.

335
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,690
This tastes good just by itself.

336
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,920
New Joseon is really so full of tasty things.

337
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,090
I know, right?

338
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,210
Oh, My Lady, just go upstairs.

339
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,820
I'll bring it up to you after I'm done preparing it.

340
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,920
But how long are you going to call me My Lady?

341
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,830
Pardon?

342
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,050
We're in new Joseon, and you aren't my maidservant anymore.

343
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,390
Just call me Sis.

344
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,130
How could I do that to such a precious princess like you, My Lady?

345
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,720
What's wrong with being like true sisters?

346
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,940
Try calling me Sis. Come on.

347
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,470
Try it!

348
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,000
S... Sis.

349
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,710
Gosh, hurry up and go upstairs.

350
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,520
Okay. I'll take this with me and eat it.

351
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,900
Okay. You can eat it all.

352
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,270
Hurry up and go upstairs. Hurry up.

353
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,470
Hurry up— Don't run, though. Slowly now.

354
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,130
But hurry up and go upstairs!

355
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,380
Secretary Hong.

356
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,890
Secretary Hong.

357
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,690
Yes, yes?

358
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,610
Let's just look it up at home.

359
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,370
We've been here for three hours already.

360
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,660
Already?

361
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,690
I thought maybe 30 minutes had passed.

362
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,020
I'll find it really quickly.

363
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,800
I don't know what Grandfather asked you to do, but let's do it next time.

364
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,350
No, you can't!

365
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,860
I need you to review the document and take it to the chairman today.

366
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,600
If I don't, I'll really get in trouble!

367
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,210
So, what is the document that you're looking for?

368
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,360
Well, the thing is...

369
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,990
Pardon?
[My Wife ♥]

370
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,810
H-Hello? Y-Yes, Sa Wol.

371
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,300
What did you say?

372
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,550
Ms. Yeon Woo?

373
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,550
What is it?

374
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,500
Gosh, when are they coming?

375
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,860
Yeon Woo!

376
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,840
Hurry!

377
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,760
Yeon Woo!

378
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,100
Trickster Guy!

379
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,530
Are you okay? What's the matter?

380
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,820
Damn it!

381
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,670
Will this be okay?

382
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,620
Are you sure this will work?

383
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:36,550
The love between a man and a woman is sparked when they're together by themselves.

384
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,070
Spark!

385
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,760
- Secretary Hong said—
- I think Sa Wol was playing a joke—

386
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,450
You should speak first. What about Sa Wol?

387
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,370
Oh, no. It's nothing important.

388
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,990
Instead of standing there, you should come and sit here—

389
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,120
No, that's not what I mean—

390
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,710
I mean, it's just weird for you to stand there.

391
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,160
I know that. Did I say anything?

392
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,760
But what is that on your cheek?

393
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,490
Are you saving it for later?

394
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,330
You're such a dog and donkey hair eater. Picking a fight with me again.

395
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,910
But what does that mean? The dog and donkey hair?

396
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,670
You seem to use it often.

397
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,770
You don't even know that?

398
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,830
A petty bastard who would eat the hair that falls off a dog or donkey!

399
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,580
- Petty bastard?
- Yes.

400
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,820
- Me?
- That's right.

401
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,490
- Gosh, why?
- See? You're petty and about to get mad again.

402
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,830
When did I ever get mad—

403
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,890
This is for Chairman Oh of SW.

404
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,800
And this is for CEO Song.

405
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,550
Make sure there are no problems with delivery.

406
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,480
Yes, got it.

407
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,420
Wait...

408
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,250
CEO! CEO. CEO.

409
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,650
You did this, right?

410
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,740
Please take a look.

411
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,290
This is Park Yeon Woo's design. Right?

412
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,140
Gosh, I revere you.

413
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,950
When did you set such a great trap like this?

414
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,220
The comment section is on fire right now.

415
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,330
So much talk about how she may be ruining the event, blah, blah, blah.

416
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,430
Do I look like I have that much time?

417
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,120
You don't.

418
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,450
Then, who do you think did this?

419
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,630
I don't know who it is, but I guess there's another person

420
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,600
who considers Park Yeon Woo a nuisance.

421
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:43,600
But we're technically together by ourselves.

422
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,450
You're right.

423
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,440
I told you it sparks.

424
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,510
[Deputy Yoo Ha Na]

425
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,370
We're in big trouble—

426
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,540
We're in big trouble...

427
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,810
The company bulletin board is a problem,

428
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,730
but another company even made clothes that are exactly like Ms. Yeon Woo's designs already.

429
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,060
They really set out to do this.

430
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,100
It's probably CEO Min again. Right?

431
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,040
Track the IP address, and try entering this online shopping mall.

432
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,980
Something's bound to pop up.

433
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,560
Okay.

434
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,180
But what do we do about Ms. Yeon Woo?

435
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,730
She'll have to remake all of this.

436
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,330
What are you doing!

437
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,290
How did you handle your designs that we're in this mess even before the show!

438
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,090
I-I definitely made sure to keep it safe...

439
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,880
You call that an excuse?

440
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,970
Regardless of the reasons, a design leak is the designer's responsibility.

441
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,600
You're doing such a terrible job with this.

442
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,280
No wonder you landed here through nepotism.

443
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,730
Nepotism?

444
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,250
What is that?

445
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,320
You really don't know what that is?

446
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,570
It's someone like you, Park Yeon Woo.

447
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,170
Someone on top put you in this position.

448
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,920
Resolve this, no matter what it takes, unless you intend to ruin our first-anniversary event.

449
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,950
I was too ambitious.

450
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,750
Step away from the first-anniversary event.

451
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,500
- No, I can't do that.
- Should I resign instead?

452
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,080
- Grandfather!
- Chairman!

453
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,100
I am speaking to you as the Chairman of SH.

454
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,470
Let those who like to talk about others and gossip do so all they want.

455
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,410
That doesn't matter to me at all.

456
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,460
The problem is that you were the one who tossed them fodder for it.

457
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,780
And yet, you will still become the owner of SH?

458
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,900
That is all the more why I can't...

459
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,830
step away from the first-anniversary event.

460
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,530
What did you say?

461
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,200
Hey! Say that one more time!

462
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,700
You can ask me all you want, but my answer will remain the same.

463
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,470
What's important to me right now isn't becoming the owner of SH,

464
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,220
but completing the first-anniversary event well.

465
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,960
Hey, Kang Tae Ha, punk!

466
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,250
I'm sorry for entering without permission.

467
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,550
Tae Ha did nothing wrong, Grandfather.

468
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,720
It was all my fault and happened because I wasn't good enough,

469
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,430
so please stop being angry at him.

470
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,060
Do you really think that?

471
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,080
Then, you should quit.

472
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,380
It is a major hit to Tae Ha for something like this to happen right before the general meeting.

473
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:34,450
I can't just take his side regarding the design leak incident, either.

474
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,650
So, Yeon Woo, you should—

475
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,980
I refuse to allow that, no matter what.

476
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:43,210
Both Yeon Woo and I will not give up on the first-anniversary event.

477
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,580
This is the decision I've made as the person in charge of the event,

478
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:55,140
and I will take responsibility for whatever happens as a result, Chairman.

479
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,920
Let's go, Yeon Woo.

480
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,480
Yeon Woo, did you commit a crime or something?

481
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,310
Don't be like that, and look at me.

482
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,830
I'm sorry.

483
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,830
You ended up like this because of me.

484
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,430
So, will you quit then?

485
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,570
After making such a declaration to Grandfather?

486
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,600
No, I will do it!

487
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,080
I...

488
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,730
won't give up.

489
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,750
Then, don't listen to what others say.

490
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,380
If I say it's okay, it's okay.

491
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,270
Got it?

492
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,610
Then don't listen to what others say.

493
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,770
If I say it's okay, it's okay.

494
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,280
Huh? Why am I like this?

495
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,480
Dol Swe, am I sick or something?

496
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,810
I hear my heart pounding these days.

497
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,690
It's as if someone's building a house in here.

498
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,250
Do you think this is okay?

499
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,640
No. This isn't the time to be like this.

500
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,580
Let's go, Park Yeon Woo!

501
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,390
Butterfly, you can do it!

502
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,720
The color of the knot will be this color,

503
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,210
and I'm thinking of matching it with this outfit.

504
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,280
I'm thinking of doing it with color 923. What do you think?

505
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,010
It's great that you're detailed,

506
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,870
but how about this?

507
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,360
A clean pattern with simple lines.

508
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,930
I did not know you had such a talent.

509
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,450
Why? Did you fall in love?

510
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,510
Do you feel all fluttery?

511
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,120
I've only fallen in love with your drawing.

512
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,130
Only your drawing.

513
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,120
Why are you working so hard?

514
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,410
You can just get by.

515
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,650
So that I won't regret it later.

516
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,800
It would be a shame to have regrets later

517
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,860
about fighting more or working hard,

518
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,410
after working so hard to get here.

519
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,670
Here.

520
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,780
Ji Ho! Ji Ho! Get that one for me. The white bunny.

521
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,580
Okay, I'll pull whatever you want, Seon Ah.

522
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,950
Gosh, it was so close.

523
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,350
I'll pull something else for you.

524
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,010
- Let's go.
- All right.

525
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,970
Moon rabbit...

526
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,110
You finally did it.

527
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,770
It's very Korean and unique. It's perfect for the finale.

528
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,810
I'm really sorry about what happened.

529
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,770
You had to go through so much trouble because of me.

530
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,500
What do you mean, trouble?

531
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:17,820
But this is the first time I've seen such neat needlework.

532
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,070
Thanks to learning it from my mom while getting scolded.

533
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:24,140
When I was younger, I was a troublemaker.

534
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,160
Every day, I would go out and ride horses, shoot arrows,

535
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,480
read romance novels,

536
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,500
and insist on going to the Qing Dynasty.

537
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,290
Romance novels...

538
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,170
Qing dynasty?

539
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,640
O-Oh, I meant I imitated it while watching historical dramas!

540
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,420
There were so many things I wanted to do.

541
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,730
By the way, Yeon Woo, you really like butterflies.

542
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,520
You always have butterflies in your clothes.

543
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,810
That's why my mother used to call me Butterfly when I was younger.

544
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,150
When I think about it,

545
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,590
making clothes under my own name,

546
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,270
and being here right now...

547
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:09,110
all feel like a butterfly dream.

548
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,740
[Daily Diary]

549
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,150
Today is my butterfly Yeon Woo's birthday.

550
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,460
I made her new clothes as a present,

551
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,960
and she said she wants dye from the Qing Dynasty.

552
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,070
She doesn't read the books I tell her to read

553
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,060
but always reads romance novels instead.

554
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,440
Yeon Woo...

555
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,420
Butterfly...

556
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,720
Yeon Woo.

557
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,090
You're here.

558
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,230
W-What are you doing here?

559
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,400
I was waiting for you.

560
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,940
For me?

561
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,090
W-Why?

562
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,160
So we can look at the moon together.

563
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,300
The moon?

564
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,830
I'll return the moon rabbit that I stole from you.

565
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,730
You should make your wish to this guy now.

566
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,770
It will come true really darn well.

567
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,940
All right, everyone! Pay attention.

568
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,790
This is the biggest event for our SH.

569
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,710
Make sure to check the VIP list.

570
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,200
And don't forget to cross-check the IDs and the invitations.

571
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,880
- You got that?
- Yes.

572
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,500
Deputy CEO.

573
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,960
A mail was sent to the model agency saying our event date was changed?

574
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,860
After checking it, it wasn't sent from our team.

575
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,250
Is it possible to contact a different model agency?

576
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,770
Seok Ju and Tae Min are looking into it right now,

577
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,270
but we're running out of time right now.

578
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,130
CEO! CEO!

579
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,530
Did you hear?

580
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:32,610
It looks like they won't be able to do the event because the models didn't come.

581
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:36,070
Deputy CEO Kang is furious right now.

582
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,400
Tae Min, how did it go?

583
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,600
We've called all the agencies we could check, but they all said they can't.

584
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,540
Are the models still not here?

585
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,790
If you ask me, I can find some for you right now.

586
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,050
I guess you don't need my help. All right.

587
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,190
Please, CEO.

588
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,540
Please help us.

589
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,170
All right.

590
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,240
I will do so.

591
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,630
CEO Min!

592
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,940
What is this? What are you plotting?

593
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,080
I'm the CEO of SH.

594
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,900
What would I gain if the event is ruined?

595
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,050
CEO Min just helped out of good will?

596
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,360
If you have time for this, go and do your work. Don't act like a kid.

597
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,330
It's been a while.

598
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,390
Have you been well?

599
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,710
You can start your walk from here.

600
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,910
- The assistant director will give you the cue to start walking.
- Okay.

601
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:20,370
And you will pose at the end of the runway and when you come back to the entrance.

602
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,540
Please go and check.

603
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,940
Okay. Thank you.

604
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,390
What are you doing not working?

605
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,610
Why did you do that earlier?

606
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,740
You even bowed your head to CEO Min.

607
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,500
I'm a businessman.

608
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,490
I can do that as much as needed.

609
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,510
And you waited a long time for this event.

610
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,010
You did that for me?

611
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,760
Of course.

612
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,550
Since you are one of my own, Yeon Woo.

613
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,870
Oh! W-What is wrong with this?

614
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:01,410
- Why?
- What's wrong?

615
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,580
Gosh, what the...

616
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,070
Why is this like this?

617
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,870
Well, when I brought the finale outfit and lifted the cover, the clothes were...

618
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,060
It was fine this morning...

619
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,430
Someone definitely did this on purpose—

620
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:18,370
We will start soon. What do we do?

621
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:24,180
By chance, can we do the finale with your clothes, Mi Dam?

622
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,320
There is a story to a collection.

623
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,360
The clothes were made with Yeon Woo's theme of connection.

624
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,590
If we suddenly change the finale outfit, the overall flow will be disrupted. We can't do that.

625
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:36,240
Is there any other way?

626
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:42,020
There is nothing we can do except to completely pull all of Yeon Woo's clothes.

627
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,560
Is everyone here?

628
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,180
Why aren't they starting?

629
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,410
Where did you come from?

630
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,110
Me?

631
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,730
MB...

632
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,000
S. It's a new company.

633
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,650
I see.

634
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,990
We can't stall any longer.

635
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:35,810
The chairman is also here. What if he gets mad at you, too?

636
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,010
I'll pull my clothes.

637
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,470
Yeon Woo!

638
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,410
Just pull my clothes and do it.

639
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,350
The show is more important than me.

640
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:47,960
Park Yeon Woo, do you really mean that?

641
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,450
Will you really be okay with that?

642
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,870
Are you going to give up?

643
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,920
[Park Yeon Woo]

644
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,780
Thirty minutes.

645
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,020
Just give me 30 minutes. I'll make sure to remake it by then.

646
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,910
I'll handle the outside. Just make sure you're on time.

647
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,800
Secretary Hong and Lee Seok Ju, follow me.

648
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,780
- Okay.
- Pardon? W-Why me?

649
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,190
Yeon Woo, what are you planning to do now?

650
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,670
What if we make the torn dress into pants?

651
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,060
We can turn it into pants, remove the sleeves, and connect them.

652
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,220
A jumpsuit. I think that will be okay.

653
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,330
Let's start on it right away!

654
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,330
Thank you.

655
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,880
There was a problem with one of Yeon Woo's clothes?

656
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,350
- Proceed immediately with that one excluded.
- Grandfather.

657
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,920
Is this what you said about taking responsibility? Is this it?

658
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,130
I heard about the models, too.

659
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:59,320
If you keep giving your mother reasons like this,

660
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,690
forget becoming the CEO, your current position will be at risk.

661
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,170
I know that. I know, but...

662
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,000
I want to protect both Yeon Woo and this show.

663
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,950
I'm sorry.

664
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,200
All right. Fine.

665
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,490
You do whatever you want.

666
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,070
Is Park Yeon Woo that important to you?

667
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,930
Enough to go against the chairman's will?

668
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,260
But do you know...

669
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,800
that you are like that to me, Deputy CEO.

670
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,730
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

671
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,560
I beg you, give me a chance, too—

672
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,730
Deputy Yoo, that's your place.

673
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,150
Do not cross the line any further.

674
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,280
Ha Na...

675
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,380
Will anyone acknowledge you if you skip lunch and work like that?

676
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,840
What a way to make your seniors look bad.

677
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,260
The proposal is decent. I like it. Proceed with it.

678
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,260
Thank you. I will work harder from now on.

679
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,930
I don't understand why you're the one answering, Deputy Choi.

680
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,110
Pardon? What do you mean by that?

681
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:52,090
I prefer someone who is true rather than someone who works well.

682
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,940
Deputy Choi, you will be excluded from this project as of today.

683
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,220
You take over, Yoo Ha Na.

684
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,810
Let's have our meeting over lunch.

685
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:08,170
Do you like sandwiches?

686
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,070
Yes. I like them.

687
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,190
When is it starting? Ten minutes have already passed.

688
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:28,860
No way. This event isn't a failure, is it?

689
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,100
I've got such a bad feeling about this.

690
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,400
Right, Joon?

691
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,800
Mom, be quiet.

692
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,450
Please!

693
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,740
Are they about to start?

694
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,280
It's pretty.

695
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,540
My Lady...

696
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,660
Yeon Woo!

697
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,970
Aren't these the patterns you designed?

698
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,350
This was the Deputy CEO's idea.

699
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:44,370
He asked me to make some video art using the patterns Yeon Woo designed.

700
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,190
Really?

701
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,960
Was it a surprise gift?

702
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,170
- Oh, it's so pretty.
- Wow, it's golden.

703
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,470
What do you think?

704
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,370
Will this be good enough?

705
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:42,610
Maybe it's because we cut the fabric, but the patterns you made aren't very visible.

706
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:46,510
That was the main point of the finale outfit,

707
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:51,400
but don't worry too much since you tried your best.

708
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,080
Okay.

709
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,840
It's Yeon Woo's outfits.

710
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,640
It's so pretty.

711
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,980
It's the media art from earlier, right?

712
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,190
Yeon Woo has such a great sense!

713
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,730
So pretty!

714
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,760
Yes!

715
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,920
About what happened with the models...

716
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,590
Why did you help Deputy CEO Kang with that?

717
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,900
That way, Father will get very angry.

718
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,900
What do you mean by that?

719
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,600
Father raised Tae Ha according to his wishes.

720
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,980
However, things have changed ever since Yeon Woo appeared.

721
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:26,760
Tae Ha started going against Father's wishes, one at a time.

722
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,730
Tae Ha and Yeon Woo will grow closer together.

723
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:33,410
Then, Father will be shaken further.

724
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,840
Tae Ha now has a new weakness in Yeon Woo,

725
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,500
and Father now has another person getting in the way,

726
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,940
so this is good for me.

727
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:14,670
By chance, may I ask you your name?

728
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:18,080
My name is Tae Ha.

729
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,250
Kang Tae Ha.

730
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,810
Young Master?

731
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,880
Yeon Woo...

732
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,010
Husband...

733
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:41,420
Husband! Husband!

734
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,120
Husband...

735
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,090
Do you now understand the repeated fate?

736
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:31,590
[Park Yeon Woo]

737
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,620
You're here.

738
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,510
Did it hurt a lot?

739
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:58,350
When that man left your side?

740
01:01:07,771 --> 01:01:10,312
[DANGER - No Entry - Do Not Enter]

741
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,110
Where is this?

742
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:29,560
Chairman Kang said he would send me to Paris.

743
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,480
Oh, CEO, CEO, CEO!

744
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,270
Something amazing happened. Amazing!

745
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:01,680
I had someone tail Deputy CEO Kang, remember?

746
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,900
But he found out something really big about him.

747
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,920
Here, take a look.

748
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,180
What is this?

749
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,870
It's medication.

750
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:17,520
It is a vasodilator that he takes because of his heart.

751
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,680
Heart?

752
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,080
Yes.

753
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,830
Deputy CEO Kang's birth mother passed away because of a heart condition. Right?

754
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,880
I wanted to ignore it to the end.

755
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,750
I was afraid you may look for...

756
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,250
traces of him in me.

757
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:51,590
But I've learned what that fate is.

758
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,660
And that I can never win against him.

759
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,560
Let's go now. It's late.

760
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,850
Although my husband was someone...

761
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:12,430
who was merely a sad and painful person to me,

762
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,780
you are different, Tae Ha.

763
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:18,160
When I look at you,

764
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,830
I feel warm, grateful,

765
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,300
and worried.

766
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,420
Sometimes, you make me angry and resentful,

767
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,390
so I don't know what to do.

768
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,270
But I know one thing at least.

769
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,810
What I am looking at aren't traces of someone else,

770
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:47,050
but you.

771
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,280
The first person to change my fate.

772
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,800

[The Story of Park's Marriage Contract]

787
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:54,630
Why didn't you tell me how beautiful the ocean is?

788
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,730
Can't we just live here?

789
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,360
We don't even know how to go back.

790
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,160
You can sleep on the bed.

791
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,060
Would it be okay if I confirmed it once?

792
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:08,570
Does Father also know that Tae Ha has a heart problem?

793
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,810
I officially propose a dismissal of the Deputy CEO Kang.

794
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:15,630
I don't want her to go through the same type of pain.
