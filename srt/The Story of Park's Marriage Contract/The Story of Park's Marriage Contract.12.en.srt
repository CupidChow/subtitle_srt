I think the operation plan will go like this.

21
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,430
Yeon Woo will walk wearing this outfit.

22
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,560
Oh, that's not bad.

Sa Wol! What brings you here?

25
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,530
I heard you were working late, so I made some cookies for you!

26
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,120
This is our treat so you can prepare for Ms. Yeon Woo's pop-up well.

27
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,590
Both of you are so considerate.

Sa Wol, what's the recipe for this?

29
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,590
Wow, I think you can set up shop for this.

30
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,090
Eat as much as you want. I'll make it often for you.

31

In any case, did Yeon Woo arrive in Milan okay?

32
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,500
It's been about a week since she left. Right?

33
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,770
Is she doing well?

34
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,100
She is probably doing well.

Hey, CEO Kang Tae Ha.

Why are you acting so pitifully? It really doesn't look good.

How about you, Kang Tae Min? Why are you here?

42
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,360
I came to do my job and check the outfits.

If you miss Sister-in-law, just call her!

44

Why do you always look like you won't ever see her again?

You're working quite hard until such a late hour.

46

I am not as smart as you are, Brother.

47
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,670
So, I should make up for it by moving my body.

48
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,770
I told you I would get promoted and take over SH.

49

Gosh, you're so cocky now because I let you off easy these days.

Not only did she cause her husband to die,

Then, are you saying you do not know that guy, Deok Gu?

He is your family's male servant.

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,440
Do you feel uncomfortable...

184
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,390
because I called you Wife?

185
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,280
What happened to Madam Yoon?

186
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,390
Criminal Hwang Deok Gu, listen up!

187
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,890
Though you committed this crime under the orders of your mistress,

188
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,220
I cannot take lightly that you tried to kill a noblewoman.

189
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,630
Thus, I sentence you to be beheaded.

190
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,320
Wait, beheading?

191
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,490
All I did was do what I was told, sir!

192
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,790
Spare me! This is unfair to me!

193
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,390
This is unfair!

194
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,950
All I did was do what I was told! Sir!

195
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,700
Criminal Yoon tried to kill her son out of her wicked greed,

196
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,500
yet she keeps insisting she did nothing wrong instead of repenting.

197
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,010
Her wickedness is beyond words.

198
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,340
Thus, I sentence you to 50 beatings

199
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,100
and exile to Gyo-dong.

200
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,480
Why are you here?

201
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,620
What?

202
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,630
Did you come to gloat?

203
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,890
Yes. I came to see you and gloat.

204
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,900
- You wench!
- You are so cowardly.

205
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,210
You tried to kill your son for a mere government position.

206
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,340
How could you try to run from your own crime?

207
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,120
Someone almost died because of your misplaced greed!

208
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,380
Apologize sincerely to me, my parents, and my husband.

209
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,140
That will make you somewhat human.

210
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,700
What did I do that was so wrong?

211
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,590
I—

212
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,890
I merely...

213
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,070
lived for the Kang family, as I was told.

214
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,450
Your mouth! Your mouth!

215
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,230
If you had done a good job, Tae Ha and Tae Min would have passed the state exam

216
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,410
and saved our Kang family several times over already.

217
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,840
He says that my husband being sick and my children not being successful

218
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,810
were all because of my lack of virtue. So what can I do?

219
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,750
I had to do whatever it took to elevate my family.

220
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,830
Do you really think that was your fault?

221
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,530
All of that?

222
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,460
That was what I was taught, and I believed that to be true.

223
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,560
So that must be true.

224
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,710
Is that why you tried to kill the son you raised?

225
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,400
No.

226
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,460
You could have chosen to call out what was wrong.

227
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,660
When Mother is sent into exile,

228
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,130
I am thinking of leaving my home as well.

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,570
Pardon?

230
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,130
What do you mean by that?

231
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,300
I cannot forgive what Grandfather has done.

232
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,330
And...

233
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:07,430
I want to stay by your side without feeling ashamed.

234
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,360
I know you suffered because of my family.

235
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,460
But if you will allow me,

236
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,090
I want to continue our relationship as a married couple.

Give it to me!

Never let anything put you in a cage.

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,940
I was able to endure it, thinking of you

253
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,940
You were cheerful and brilliantly shining...

254
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,110
You were always dreaming...

255
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,130
and made me envious, and I thought you were lovely.

256
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,960
When I found out you were to become my wife, I hesitated.

257
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,400
Because of my heart ailment.

258
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,900
However, I could not give you up.

Even if it is just for a moment,

I wanted to be with you.

You look downcast.

No, it is nothing.

00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,930
What excuse did you want to hear from her?

00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,880
was not Madam Yoon but His Excellency Kang.

I understand how you feel, but what can you do?

That is...

281
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,270

Your heart that was close to death just a few days ago has no issues anymore.

That's a relief, then.

00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:00,310
Please help us and fix this situation,

363
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,600
so there are no more innocent deaths.

364
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,130
- Please help us!
- Please help us!

Please help us!

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,000
Please help us!

368
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,900
Please help us!

369
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,830
Please help us!

370
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,190
What she said is quite valuable.

371
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,180
That is right.

372
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,120
Women are also your precious people, King.

373
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:45,990
I, your mother, feel that what that child said is right.

374
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,310
What do you think?

375
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,060
Though it is beautiful for a Loyal Wife to maintain her faithfulness toward her dead husband,

376
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,520
but more people are recently trying to abuse this for their own personal gain.

377
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,250
Therefore, from now on, we will distinguish Loyal Wives strictly by law

378
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,780
and determine their validity.

379
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,700
So make sure there are no more innocent deaths.

380
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,920
Why do you keep acting however you want?

382
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,360
Are you all right?

383
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,320
What is that wound on your neck?

384
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,680
Please stay by my side now.

385
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,610
I want to keep you in my sight at all times.

386
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,840
So stay by my side, so I can always keep you in my sight.

388
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,320
What is wrong?

389
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,850
It is not because of you, so do not worry.

390
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,300
Is it because of that man?

391
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,660
The one who has the same name as mine?

392
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,490
I already knew... that your eyes were on someone else.

393
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,420
Still, that is fine with me.

394
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,350
Because... I love you.

395
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,970
I cannot do that.

396
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,990
I already gave my heart to him.

397
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,920
- Maiden—
- Please... let me go.

398
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,210
What are you talking about?

399
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,300
You will leave Hanyang?

400
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,570
I want to get some rest.

401
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,590
Things are hectic around here, and I don't feel comfortable.

402
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,320
No, you cannot.

403
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,540
How could I send you far away after you went through such a major ordeal!

404
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,910
I refuse.

405
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,910
If that is really how you feel, stay for a bit at your uncle's place.

406
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,540
Your Excellency, what are you saying!

407
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,420
The weather will be getting cold soon, too!

408
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,360
Do not worry, Wife.

409
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,240
She even spoke up in front of His Majesty.

410
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,200
Nothing will happen to her.

411
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,460
Come back whenever you feel like coming back.

412
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,140

00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,630
Why? Are you sad?

416
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:45,040
I always thought this was everything to me, but something feels weird.

417
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,580
In return, you gained access to more places.

418
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,210
Isn't that a good thing?

419
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,930
Is that so?

420
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,530
What kind of person is the new CEO?

00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,980
And thank you for introducing me.

422
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,890
We've got lots of things to do with Midam in the future. Of course, I should.

423
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,830
- You made it, CEO Park.
- Yes.

424
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,080
It's nice to see you again, CEO Kang.

425
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,670
She is the CEO of Midam I had mentioned.

It's a building I own.

430
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,410
After I leave the company, you should be able to run a small shop there.

431
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,640
It is my wedding gift to you two.

432
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,440
Gosh, no, no.

433
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,080
There is no need for that!

It's expensive, right? Right?

437

You really didn't have to.

438
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,280
Thanks for everything you've done, Brother Seong Pyo.

- Brother.

W-What did you say? What is he saying?

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,650
He is so touched that you finally called him brother, and he is so happy.

442

00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,140
how about being friends?

452
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,180
Will you not go on a walk with me?

453
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,760
I need a friend as well.

The moon is quite bright.

455
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:15,400
Shall we make a wish to the moon rabbit?

456
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,580
There is no use in that.

457
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,130
There is no moon rabbit living on that moon.

Pardon?

459
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,530
No way. How could you say such a futile thing?

460
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,660
On that moon, there is no grass to eat,

461
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,360
and only rocks are there. So, no rabbits live there.

It seems you are not feeling well. Let us go to the physician.

Hurry! I wonder if the physician will be in, though.

What are you so shocked about?

469
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,930
In 200 years, everyone's hair will be this short,

470
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:07,110

If I want to go global and make some money, should I go for an unexpected sad ending?

542
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,460
Sad, sad.

543
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,220
You have come out?

544
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,490
How do you feel?

545
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,180
I feel much better after a good night's sleep.

546
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,640
Shall we go on a picnic today?

547
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,690
A picnic?

548
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,750
The wind is quite chilly. Will you be all right?

549
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:39,280
I want to go before it gets any colder.

550
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,630
And I also want to wear the clothes you made for me, Maiden.

551
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,400
What are you looking at so intently?

552
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,330
It is just...

553
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,010
that everything seems so beautiful.

554
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,190
Those mountains and the wind...

555
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,580
and you, too.

556
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,960
It is getting late.

557
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,340
We should go now.

558
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:49,180
Can I borrow... your shoulder just for today?

559
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:00,930
Do you know... that I like your name?

560
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,100
Yeon, which means to connect. And Woo, which means to meet.

561
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,900
It is such a heartwarming name.

562
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,350
Is that so?

563
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,790
I had a dream last night.

564
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,170
It was a place that I had never been to before,

565
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:26,410
and I was... in the body of a man who looks like me.

566
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,780
Every day, I stood in front of the crepe-myrtle tree

567
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,640
waiting for someone.

568
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,480
But no matter how much I waited, she never came. So I cried for a long time

569
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,640
because I missed her so much.

570
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,790
You also...

571
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,850
greatly missed that man who looks like me. Right?

572
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,920
I am sorry for making you suffer.

573
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,400
You must have been reminded of him every time you saw me.

574
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,810
I knew about it, but I could not let you go...

575
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,100
because I love you.

576
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,370
We should go now.

577
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,890
If there is a next life,

578
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:29,170
I will make sure to be reborn as him.

579
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,230
So will you come to meet me again?

580
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,530
Then, on that day,

581
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,820
you will be able to see me as well.

582
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,860
You must not forget and come to meet me.

583
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,030
After meeting you,

584
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:57,300
I was in pain, sad, and felt a longing,

585
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,270
but I am glad.

586
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,970
I was glad that...

587
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,730
I could dwell with you even for a moment...

588
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,990
I was happy that...

589
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,770
I was able to be with you.

590
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,330
Have you been well?

591
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,820
I dropped by to say goodbye before I went to take the state exam.

592
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,350
You are taking the state exam?

593
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,570
Since I need to take care of my household now.

594
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:22,170
Brother left something behind, so I brought it with me.

595
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,220
I had someone put it in your room.

596
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,590
Yes, thank you.

597
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,540
Then I will go on my way now.

598
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,730
Be well.

599
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,380
What kind of person was your brother to you, Young Master?

600
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,000
He was such a good brother to me.

601
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,310
I am glad to hear that.

602
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,090
How dare a girl talk back to me! So arrogant!

603
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:43,000
If you pushed someone, you should apologize! Hurry up and apologize!

604
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,170
You little—

605
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:59,060
You do not know how happy I was to be able to protect you.

606
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,250
Every time I wanted to see you, Yeon Woo,

607
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,290
I would paint you over and over again.

608
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,120
My name is Yeon Woo. Park Yeon Woo.

609
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,020
It was because of this painting

610
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,280
that I just watched and let you be.

611
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,150
I see that it was all you, Young Master.

612
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,470
The one who always protected me...

613
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,400
and saved me through this painting.

614
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,850
[Enjoying our cultural artifacts together - Exhibit of SH Group's Collection]

615
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,980
This painting...

616
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,350
Doesn't it remind you of Yeon Woo the more you look at it?

617
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:22,050
I was also very shocked when I first saw it.

618
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,540
It was like seeing a portrait of Yeon Woo when she was young.

619
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,660
But when is Yeon Woo coming back?

620
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,350
It's already been over a year.

621
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,800
I just don't understand this.

622
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,990
I'm sorry, Deputy Kang.

623
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,850
What don't you understand?

624
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,520
I told you, Han Seong Hee,

625
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,420
that the MZ generation's share of the art market has increased by about 41.7%.

626
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,850
Especially for an exhibit with a strong story concept like this one,

627
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,790
that demand will grow by 70%.

628
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:54,790
So, how does it make sense not to have any QR code or app to check the exhibit guide?

629
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:57,210
I told you to prepare it!

630
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,370
That's what you meant.

631
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,460
I will make sure to check it again.

632
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,210
We don't have a lot of time. Please hurry.

633
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,640
I will do it right now.

634
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,200
Gosh, amazing.

635
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,940
I thought Kang Dro had just reincarnated.

636
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,130
I know. He's exactly like him.

637
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,490
As if they weren't brothers.

638
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:18,450
He's pretty much Kang Borg. Kang Cyborg.

639
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,320
I think I could draw much better than this.

640
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,710
Why? Are you thinking of studying it again?

641
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,960
Gosh, no thanks.

642
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,910
Working at the company is the most entertaining these days.

643
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,580
I even have a nickname.

644
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,700
Kang Cyborg.

645
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,840
That's a bit too much.

646
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,950
That seems so much like Tae Ha. It's not like you are an imitation copy.

647
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,310
But that's why I like it.

648
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,920
Gosh, I'm hungry. You said you were going to buy me lunch.

649
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,450
All right, let's eat then. What do you want to eat?

650
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,450
What should I eat?

651
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,720
Yeon Woo.

652
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,700
Mother!

653
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:47,240
Deok Goo ran away?

654
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,270
Right before he was to be beheaded, he assaulted the government official and ran away.

655
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,680
With that said, you should come back home now.

656
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,860
Your father is quite worried about you, too.

657
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,380
I am sorry, Mother.

658
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,140
Why are you acting like this?

659
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:11,730
Why are you struggling like that all by yourself?

660
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:26,240
W-What is that?

661
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,780
It may be a long story.

662
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,400
Will you listen to it?

663
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,330
I believe your story of how you went

664
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,850
to the new Joseon, Yeon Woo.

665
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:49,520
However, you should forget about it.

666
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,460
You should live your life now.

667
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:22,170
I want to go to you, but I do not know what to do.

668
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:28,140
Must I... really forget everything like this?

669
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:37,580
All right. I should at least hear your last words.

670
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,480
You bastard! What are you doing!

671
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,340
There is no point in struggling.

672
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:49,150
All you would be doing is speeding up your death.

673
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,790
What are you doing!

674
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,300
Are you not afraid of divine punishment?

675
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,230
Divine punishment...

676
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:59,320
I will receive it then... after I kill you.

677
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,810
All I did was do what I was told,

678
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:06,870
while His Excellency Kang that bastard is living perfectly fine and well.

679
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:12,180
Thus, I will take your life

680
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:15,070
for ruining my life.

681
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:04,800
Do not be resentful and pass into Paradise.

682
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:11,230
You are the one who ruined your own life.

683
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:24,510
You wench! Stop right there!

684
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:53,260
There is no point in you running away.

685
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,870
Come here.

686
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,700
I said, come here!

687
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,760
Hurry up.

688
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:26,680
Hurry up!

689
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:44,390
So, hurry up and come back.

690
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:46,720
I'll be waiting for you here.

691
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,910

01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:15,670
No...

693
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,070
No.

694
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,360
No!

695
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,830

Young Master?

726
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:45,160
I vow here in this place that the two of us

727
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:50,080
who lived looking at different things...

728
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:53,760
will be together forever with one heart.

729
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,460
By chance, you aren't trying to trick me again. Right?

730
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:03,440
Depends on how you act, my princess lady.

731
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,390
Forget that!

732
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,950
Since I put my seal on you, you are mine now.

733
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:27,310
♫ By coincidence, I am here now ♫

734
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:35,040
♫ Like fate, I look at you again ♫

735
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:44,270
♫ You bloom like a dream inside of me ♫
