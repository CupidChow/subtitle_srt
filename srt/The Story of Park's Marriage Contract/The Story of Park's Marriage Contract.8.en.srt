Would it be okay...

4
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,320
if I try confirming it once?

5
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,870
Confirming it?

Kang Tae Ha, come to the hospital tomorrow!

8
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,250
Do you really want something terrible to happen to you?

9
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,630
Yes, Senior. It's me.

Oh, my god! Oh, my god! I'm so excited!

12
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,300
This is the first time we got a reward vacation!

13
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,510
Me, too. Going to Jeju Island using someone else's money?

14
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,660
Amazing! Right?

15
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,850
I guess so.

16
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,080
Welcome.

17
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,830
- Hello!
- Hello.

18
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,830
But who is...

19
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,410
Oh, she is one of Yeon Woo's close friends.

20
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,330
I asked her if she could come with us.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Oh, Sa Wol made these snacks.

22
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,700
They are delicious.

23
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,350
It's nothing.

24
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,270
We might miss the plane. Let's hurry up and go.

25
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,610
- Thank you.
- Is it decent?

26
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,340
Oh, Sa Wol, you were a close friend of Mourning Clothes, I see.

27
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,170
If you keep your mouth shut, I'll tell you a secret about Mourning Clothes.

28
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,960
Oh, okay! You have to keep your promise. Okay?

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,020
Okay, okay.

30
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,970
What is it? What promise?

31
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,750
I didn't say anything.

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,860
There's just something like that.

33
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,670
What is it!

34
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,040
Wow, she's a great cook!

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,990
These would be a hit if she sold them.

36
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,080
What did she put in them?

37
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,830
I thought people lived there when I was young.

38
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,480
But now that I'm looking at it, it is cotton balls blooming in the sky.

39
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,240
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's whipped cream?

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,890
It's that!

41
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,990
The thing that is between the Choco pies...

42
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,100
Merrow? Marrow?

43
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,660
Marshmerrow?

44
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,240
Marshmallow?

45
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,090
That's right!

46
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,310
You can't eat clouds, right?

47
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,150
I'll buy you lots of things that are tastier than clouds.

48
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,730
It's the ocean!

49
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,040
It's the ocean!

50
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Wait!

51
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,770
Wow, it's so nice! It's so exciting!

52
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,820
Why didn't you tell me

53
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
that the ocean was this beautiful?

54
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,410
I didn't think I would ever see a world like this.

55
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,260
Do you still feel that this island is lonely?

56
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,780
He said it's a big island

57
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,780
but it's lonely because it's alone by itself.

58
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,340
I felt like I was like that island in this new Joseon.

59
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,310
I think he feels the same way.

60
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,650
I wanted to show you

61
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,410
that it is no longer lonely.

62
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,340
You and me as well.

63
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,730

73

Yes. It will cover up only as much as necessary.

- Oh, Deputy CEO! Deputy CEO!

I'm not asking you because I don't know.

I just want to confirm it.

109
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:21,050
Well, the chairman deceived Tae Ha about having a bad liver,

110
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,090
and said that he would get surgery after Tae Ha got married.

111

Father lied to Tae Ha?

112
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,820

Reached where?

When, where, and how?

150
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,980
I mean, that just somehow happened because of the situation...

151
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,880
It's okay. Everyone somehow ends up falling in love,

152
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,020
somehow ends up kissing,

153
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,480

When Young Master gives you the signal, welcome him

156
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,380
and just go for it there and then.

157
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,520
Just go for it? Why should I?

158
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,440
I'll sleep on the floor, so sleep comfortably.

No, you should use the bed.

Yes.

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,670
What? A h-heart problem?

184
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,010
W-What are you talking about?

185
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,510
Heart?

186
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,200
Is that true? Chairman?

187
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,410
CEO Min.

188
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,180
If...

189
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,430
the chairman still wanted to make Tae Ha CEO despite knowing his condition,

190
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,390
I refuse to keep it quiet.

191
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,940
SH is not your own personal company.

192
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,890
With that said,

193
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,580
I officially propose Deputy CEO Kang's dismissal.

194
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,470
Try going to the right a little bit. A little more.

195
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,450
Gosh, so pretty.

196
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,250
Should we take a photo together?

197
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,180
Gosh, let's take it together.

198
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,560
- Us, too!
- Come into the frame.

199
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,590
Ha Na.

200
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,350
I'll take it. Let's do a V.

201
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,350
One, two, three!

202
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,810
You're here.

203
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,680
Did you enjoy it?

204
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,480
What do you mean?

205
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,520
You seemed to have a crazy time upstairs with all the noise.

206
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,830
I slept well, with nothing happening.

207
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,620
Really?

208
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,550
W-Why?

209
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,980
Why would he leave you alone when you're so pretty?

210
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,110
Let's see. How long has it been since he became your lover?

211
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,760
Has it been a few days now?

212
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,090
Lover?

213
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,420
"You're mine, I'm yours. Today is our first day going out."

214
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,360
When did you guys say stuff like that?

215
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,700
We didn't say anything like that.

216
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,830
I see what's going on.

217
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,390
All right.

218
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,660
It's because you guys didn't...

219
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,500
blatantly say, "You are mine," that Young Master hesitated.

220
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,830
You should just go for it first, My Lady.

221
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,380
You guys like each other, so who cares?

222
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,520
Do you like her that much?

223
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,140
You have honey dripping from your eyes.

224
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,980
You're right.

225
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,070
It makes me happy just to look at Yeon Woo.

226
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,560
Whoa.

227
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,640
That's why I'm worried.

228
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,030
I don't know if I can make her happy.

229
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,550
Why would you worry about something like that?

230
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,300
You can see the answer just by looking at her face.

231
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,370
Yes, Director Choi.

232
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,870
What did you say?

233
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,530
CEO Min says she will have me dismissed?

234
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,650
The dismissal proposal is a problem,

235
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,580
but the Chairman also heard about your heart problem.

236
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,680
Okay. In any case, come back as soon as you can.

237
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,710
Chairman, what are you going to do now?

238
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,090
What do you mean, what will I do?

239
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,820
I'll have to let things take its natural course.

240
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,810
One thing at a time.

241
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:22,150
[Senior Hyeon Wook]

242
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,570
Hello?

243
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,680
What's wrong with your voice? Are you not feeling well?

244
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,600
I was just tired. Why? Is there a problem?

245
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,870
The results from your exam before you left for Jeju Island came back.

246
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,200
Your heart is a mess, so come back immediately.

247
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,370
Right now. Today!

248
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,010
Are you listening?

249
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,820
You're in really bad condition right now!

250
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,050
Okay. I'll call you later.

251
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,470
Kang Tae Ha. Kang Tae Ha!

252
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,630
One, two!

253
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,990
Let's go, Park Yeon Woo.

254
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,400
Ms. Bride! Ms. Bride!

255
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,370
What are you doing!

256
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,820
Do you remember

257
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,650
how I fainted on our wedding day?

258
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,020
How could I forget that day?

259
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,300
I've done lots of weird things after I came here.

260
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,250
Do I seem more like a new Joseon person now?

261
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,420
Back then, I never knew...

262
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,510
that I would end up liking a trickster like you.

263
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,220
Be mine, Kang Tae Ha.

264
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,290
I'll cherish you more than Choco.

265
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,780
Yeon Woo.

266
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,940
Let's end our contract now.

267
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,350
Are you saying we should start all over?

268
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,820
No, let's just end everything.

269
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,870
All of it.

270
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,720
End it?

271
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm not interested in a relationship. I don't have time for it, either.

272
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,850
Our contract period ended, anyway.

273
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,680
I'll look for a place for you to stay, so until then—

274
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,580
What have you been doing all this time, then?

275
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,900
You laughed with me, held hands with me, kissed me,

276
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,010
- and even brought me here—
- That was just because...

277
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,760
I got caught up in the moment.

278
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,170
I'm different from other people.

279
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,860
I can't live an ordinary life.

280
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,530
Do you mean that?

281
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,560
Did you even...

282
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,400
like me a little bit?

283
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,500
I never did.

284
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,870
You were a trickster after all.

285
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:13,890
♫ One day I had a dream ♫

286
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:21,270
♫ I woke up and was in a daze for a long time ♫

287
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:28,900
♫ I sat there helplessly for a while ♫

288
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,760
Where did you go?

289
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,490
Everyone was looking all over for you!

290
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,750
We couldn't reach you on the phone, either.

291
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,860
I guess I came back late after taking a walk.

292
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,810
You know that Young Master left first. Right?

293
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,360
But what's going on?

294
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,510
Tae Ha left?

295
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,730
You didn't know?

296
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,590
He said he had some business at the company. I guess he left already.

297
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,680
Yes. I thought he left without telling you or something.

298
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,090
- Let's hurry up and go to eat dinner.
- Okay.

299
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,170
So, Mr. Kang,

300
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:08,180
your ejection fraction has dropped to the 40% range or lower.

301
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,180
The pacemaker is not probably working.

302
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,990
This means that it's impossible to avoid heart failure.

303
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,450
When the left ventricle deteriorates,

304
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,340
blood clots can form in the heart,

305
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,870
leading to a stroke or even to a heart attack.

306
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,940
I have never seen things getting worse in such a short time.

307
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,750
What exactly happened here?

308
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:39,670
♫ Come by my side at any time ♫

309
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,940
So? Am I dying?

310
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,940
Crazy bastard.

311
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,290
Pour me a shot, too.

312
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,790
Are you crazy?

313
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,270
I'm your primary care physician!

314
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,830
You should just drink this.

315
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,880
Just drink this.

316
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,940
I've thought about all sorts of things.

317
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,600
Why did his heart suddenly get so bad?

318
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,190
Is it because of that harmful woman?

319
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,460
Your heart kept beating so fast because you love her?

320
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,710
But that's a bunch of crap.

321
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,650
How does that make sense?

322
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,460
Your heart is also...

323
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,870
totally crappy, medically speaking.

324
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,880
It just doesn't make sense whatsoever.

325
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,890
You're right.

326
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,640
I may die at any moment,

327
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,490
but I keep thinking about that woman only.

328
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,780
This makes no sense. Right?

329
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:09,330
♫ But no matter how much I look at it, I can only think of myself  ♫

330
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,160
You were a trickster, after all.

331
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,920
I feel bad for making her cry,

332
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,730
I'm afraid that I won't see her again,

333
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,950
and I'm worried that she may hate me.

334
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,310
I guess my heart...

335
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,910
is really broken, after all.

336
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:52,260
♫ When I wake up from this dream ♫

337
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,860
♫  I wait for you to tell me ♫

338
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,500
What do you mean by that?

339
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,250
A contract marriage? With Yeon Woo?

340
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,860
I couldn't marry someone, knowing about my heart problem.

341
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,540
But I still wanted to protect you and the company somehow, Grandfather—

342
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,590
And that's all you came up with as the solution?

343
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,050
How long did you think you could fool everyone?

344
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,870
I didn't want to make you worry.

345
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,440
Did you think I wouldn't know?

346
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,720
I'm talking about your heart.

347
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,480
What do you mean by that?

348
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,080
I received the reports on it after the surgery.

349
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,570
That is why I rushed your marriage.

350
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,190
I acted like I didn't know and did all that for your good.

351
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,910
How could you make things end up like this?

352
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,190
You should have talked with me, whether it's marriage or your heart!

353
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,230
What can you do without me?

354
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,180
So, what are you going to do now?

355
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,370
CEO Min is one thing, but what about Yeon Woo?

356
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,220
I've decided to end the contract with Yeon Woo.

357
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,510
You've already wrapped it up?

358
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,090
Yes.

359
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,410
All right. That may be the right process.

360
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,720
Good job.

No.

00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,560
Don't be too resentful and pass into Paradise.

539
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,980
Yeah.

540
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,600
Okay.

541
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,480
Okay.

542
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,300
Why?

543
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,880
Did Secretary Hwang say something to you?

544
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,200
N-No. It's nothing.

545
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,250
He does whatever CEO Min tells him to do,

546
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,000
so try not to get mixed up with him.

547
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,870
I won't.

548
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,350
It's so hard to meet with you face to face.

549
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:34,160
I called you several times before.

550
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,620
What can I do? There are too many people watching.

551
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,520
It's not that you don't need me anymore?

552
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,810
Fix your habit of trying to confirm what you already know.

553
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,280
I will tell the Deputy CEO everything.

554
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,560
How you've used me, Chairman.

555
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,500
The texts and photos we've exchanged, all of it—

556
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,150
What about that?

557
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:57,420
I asked you to keep an eye on my grandson because I was worried about him, so what?

558
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,090
You promised!

559
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,800
You said you would let me be with the Deputy CEO.

560
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,940
Tae Ha says he doesn't like you. What can I do about it?

561
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,220
I won't give up like this.

562
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,350
Okay. Do as you wish.

563
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:17,310
When people feel so wronged, they have trouble sleeping at night.

564
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,700
Also, watch out next time.

565
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,240
Someone else may come instead of me.

566
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,720
Let's see...

567
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,170
It's done.

568
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,930
Hello?

569
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,340
Oh, my, Congresswoman.

570
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,190
What led you to call me at this hour?

571
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,220
Oh, I wanted to ask you a favor urgently.

572
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,570
A favor?

573
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,560
Who...

574
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,520
Park Yeon Woo?

575
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,010
Tarak, have you tried it before?

576
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,830
The taste of tarak.

577
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,850
Dol Swe!

578
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,750
Dol Swe!

579
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,640
♫ Why do I talk faster ♫

580
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,630
♫ repeat myself, and feel out of breath? ♫

581
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:16,930
♫ I keep wanting to walk with you, and as I walk, I end up smiling ♫

582
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:25,300
♫ When I laugh along with you, it all feels like a dream ♫

583
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,680
A US congresswoman wants to meet with Yeon Woo?

584
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,500
She is one of my longtime clients.

585
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,260
I think she fell in love with Yeon Woo after this past fashion show.

586
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,300
That's good.

587
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,840
Did you ask to see me about that?

588
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,680
No. It's not that.

589
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,900
I'm actually thinking of planning for the launch of overseas stores starting next month.

590
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,310
Along with Yeon Woo.

591
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,310
With Yeon Woo?

592
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,170
You guys are still newlyweds, and I felt bad.

593
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,830
So I called you to talk to you about it first.

594
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,470
Oh, I see.

595
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,650
I keep wanting more of Yeon Woo.

596
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,830
There's a lot of things I want to show and teach her.

597
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:27,540
Will it be okay for you to be separated from her for a while?

598
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,790
I can tell from looking at you since eyes don't lie.

599
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:37,410
What I am looking at isn't traces of someone else, but you.

600
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,360
Let's end our contract now.

601
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,190
Did you even like me?

602
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,350
I never did.

603
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,090
Well, the back of the sofa in the living room was too uncomfortable, so—

604
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,850
Brother, are you really going out with that girl named Sa Wol?

605
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,200
She's not a girl, but an older sister.

606
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,430
Forget that. I don't like it.

607
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,110
She looks like she has quite a temper!

608
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,270
That's why she is the perfect match for you, my younger sister.

609
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,260
Gosh, I don't want you to! I said I don't like it!

610
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,990
Gosh, stop it!

611
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,650
My head hurts already because the Deputy CEO is about to get kicked out of the company.

612
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,180
Must you add to my stress?

613
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:29,300
Your Deputy CEO is getting kicked out of the company?

614
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,260
What are you talking about?

615
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,750
Ms. Yeon Woo.

616
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,480
Did something happen to the Trickster Guy?

617
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,910
Everyone found out about the Deputy CEO's heart ailment,

618
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,670
so the situation at the company isn't great.

619
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,430
Because of you, Ms. Yeon Woo found out about everything!

620
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,810
The Deputy CEO told me to keep it a secret!

621
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:58,970
It's not like I knew Ms. Yeon Woo would be there.

622
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,610
Just act like you don't know anything.

623
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,020
Just don't get caught by the Deputy CEO.

624
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,710
It's not like you'll see him right now.

625
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,220
Secretary Hong!

626
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,590
Deputy CEO?

627
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,510
Do you like it that much?

628
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,510
Yeah!

629
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,670
Yeon Woo.

630
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,190
Why are you standing there in the rain?

631
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:17,480
What if you catch a cold?

632
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,090
Did you run over here?

633
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,950
Are you crazy? What if something happens to you?

634
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,570
You said you didn't like me.

635
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,700
It's okay if something happens to me.

636
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,480
As long as you are by my side.

637
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,860
I like you.

638
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:44,490
I like you.

639
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,800
I like you a lot.

640
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,740
I like you.

641
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,000
Will you run away again?

642
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,390
Will you hide your pain and not talk about your struggles like an idiot?

643
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,720
Are you going to do that again?

644
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,950
Because my heart is messed up,

645
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,340
I feel so bad for you, Yeon Woo.

646
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,920
I'll just be a selfish bastard.

647
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,670
So...

648
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,080
could you like me again?

649
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,380
Did you forget already?

650
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,450
I already asked you to be mine.

651
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,640
This is a new Dol Swe.

652
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,200
I did have to clean...

653
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,950
And it was a bit lonely without you, so I just got another friend...

654
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,520
Are you saying you added another family member?

655
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,900
You guys do good work by yourselves, don't you?

656
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,410
All right. You will be New Dol Swe,

657
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,680
and you will be Ma Dang Swe.

658
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,200
With these guys... wait, what was that?

659
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:05,450
This. I want to try doing this. Will that be all right?

660
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,400
If it's that, we can do it somewhere else.

661
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,420
This is all ice?

662
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,670
It's so fascinating how it's cold, and there's ice everywhere,

663
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,600
though it's not Snow Country or winter!

664
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,390
It's still too early to be surprised.

665
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,140
[Curling Center]

666
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,390
Dol Swe!

667
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,810
Dol Swe!

668
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,730
Nice! Good shot!

669
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,450
- Good shot!
- Good shot!

670
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,760
It's the best!

671
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,960
Curl! Curl!

672
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,310
It ended up touching my foot.

673
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,690
- Hey, Tae Ha!
- Bang!

674
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,440
Come here.

675
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,890
Hey!

676
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,590
Come here!

677
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,270
It was so much fun.

678
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,880
Can we come again next time?

679
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,660
Of course. As much as you want.

680
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,170
Should we just make a curling team named Team Park Yeon Woo?

681
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,980
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, never mind.

682
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,570
Should I just build an ice rink instead?

683
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,340
How much is an ice rink?

684
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,900
If it's not too bad, let's build one!

685
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:51,150
Maybe it'll be the cost of the palace where the king used to live.

686
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,670
It's that expensive?

687
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,750
Oh, ice cream, ice cream!

688
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,140
How could she go back after leaving the house for only a few days?

689
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,090
Come on! How great is it that the two of them reconciled?

690
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:40,010
I got my room back and all. It's a relief.

691
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:43,110
I was really worried that Ms. Yeon Woo might have made up her mind firmly.

692
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,050
Firm? Who is firm?

693
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,570
Do you know how softhearted My Lady is?

694
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,840
Gosh, she was designated a Loyal Wife. I'm sure she's no joke.

695
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,630
Loyal Wife?

696
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,640
Who is a Loyal Wife?

697
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,790
She's not? I heard the Deputy CEO talk about a well and all.

698
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,680
I thought it was strange.

699
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,630
Ms. Yeon Woo and Loyal Wife don't seem to match well.

700
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,970
Loyal Wife, my foot.

701
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,220
Since everyone is here,

702
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:21,180
we will start the voting regarding the dismissal proposal of Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha—

703
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,380
What? Is that true?

704
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,960
Yes.

705
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,150
Hello, SH Seoul family.

706
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,560
This is Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha.

707
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,920
I want to tell you what I wasn't able to tell you before, Executives.

708
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,380
From a long time ago,

709
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,400
I've lived with a pacemaker implanted in my heart.

710
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,930
- As a management officer of SH Seoul,
- Really?

711
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,900
- I bow my head and apologize
- Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha?

712
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,110
for not telling you clearly about

713
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:06,030
- my current health condition.
- What'll happen to the company then?

714
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:13,110
I know that my health issues may become a burden for our company.

715
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,000
So that this doesn't happen again,

716
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,850
I think our company needs a structural change.

717
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:23,260
SH needs to become a company where any proven management specialist

718
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:27,360
can participate in management now, even if they're not part of the owner's family.

719
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,670
I will make a proposal regarding this at the upcoming general meeting.

720
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,920
Please vote regarding my dismissal then as well.

721
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:03,330
Gosh, she was designated a Loyal Wife. I'm sure she's no joke.

722
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,450
No way. It's not true.

723
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:10,040
My Lady definitely said she got kidnapped.

724
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,190
Lady...

725
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,960
But if she got kidnapped, he should have just taken her.

726
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,670
So why did he throw her in a well and put her shoes there?

727
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:28,600
As if to tell everyone that she died there.

728
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:33,160
It's not like he was trying to make her into a Loyal Wife...

729
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,360
If the watch that I saw was really Lady's

730
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,000
then something is definitely up.

731
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:53,580
There is no reason for that to be in the Kang family!

732
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,840
Sa Wol!

733
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,060
Are you cleaning right now?

734
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,740
What are you doing?

735
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,580
My Lady, let's go.

736
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,840
Let's get out of this house right now.

737
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,580
I was supposed to meet Tae Ha here.

738
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,140
W-Why is this here?

739
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:12,910
The one who threw you in the well probably picked it up when you dropped it.

740
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:15,640
- What are you saying?
- You still don't get it?

741
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,590
This Kang family...

742
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,340
killed you, My Lady.

743
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,370
That was a great move.

744
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,600
The responses are great.

745
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,250
It doesn't matter. I did that for everyone to hear.

746
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,590
Then where are we going now?

747
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,870
My Lady, where are you going?

748
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,110
My Lady!

749
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,810
My Lady—

750
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,840
My Lady.

756
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:16,250
I asked what that is!

757
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:20,430
It is what you are thinking right now.

758
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,660
Why are you doing this to me?

759
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:26,030
What do you want me to do!

760
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:30,000
I am just trying to show you

761
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,900
what you are curious about, My Lady.

762
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,320
This is arsenic.

763
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:47,360
Keep adding this to Tae Ha's food until his wedding day.

764
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,480
No. No...

765
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,580
It's Park Yeon Woo's item.

766
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,950
Don't be too resentful

767

[The Story of Park's Marriage Contract]

773
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:02,980
This is the worst of the ill-fated connection! Get out, I said!

774
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,280
I'm sorry.

775
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,270
It's not our fault. We're just stuck in terrible fate.

776
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:09,640
If you're with the Young Lady...

777
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,090
I will die just like myself in the past life since the fate is repeated.

778
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,730
I will take care of the Deputy CEO Kang as you wished.

Because of that woman, you're giving up!

784
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:28,150
