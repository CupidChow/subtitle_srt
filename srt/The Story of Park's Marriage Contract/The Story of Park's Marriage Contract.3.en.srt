[All characters, places, organizations, and institutions that appear in this drama are a work of fiction.]

2
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,410
Secretary Hong, prepare a car for me in front of the main gate.

3
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,280
You must know who I am.

4
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,810
What are you doing in my house?

5
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,970
What do you think? I'm here to see my daughter-in-law.

6
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,090
Will you let go?

7
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,720
It's nice to meet you. I'm Tae Ha's mom.

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,020
My mother...

9
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,620
passed away. So leave this instant.

10
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,470
How long will you keep this up? You should grow up now that you're married.

11
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,050
That is why your grandfather is always so busy cleaning up your mess.

12
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,390
He told me to let you be in charge

13
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,690
of the Hwajeopdo exhibit as your wedding gift.

14
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,030
Did you ask him for that?

15
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,030
CEO Min, I guess you run the company like that, getting asked to do things.

16
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,440
I don't work like that, so please leave now if you're done here.

17
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,280
You should stop now.

18
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,060
Kang Tae Ha is about to flip out.

19
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,080
You will come with Tae Ha to Grandfather's birthday next week. Right?

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,550
Pardon? Oh, yes.

21
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,760
Since we've become family, we should get along.

22
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,300
When you come then, it would be nice if you were dressed more appropriately.

23
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,350
Come in sometime today. I'll give you a position on the marketing team.

24
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,660
I pissed Kang Tae Ha off like you wanted, and you suddenly want me to work in the company?

25
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,520
- That's no fun!
- Did I tell you to work?

26
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Just hold a position

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,110
if you want to get what little that is yours.

28
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,070
Your grandfather is not an easy person.

29
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,640
She was definitely my husband's mother.

30
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,510
Was that person really your mother?

31
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,670
From what I heard, she sounds like your stepmother.

32
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,120
What does that have to do with you?

33
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,050
And who are you to decide whether you'll go to Grandfather's birthday or not?

34
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,830
- It is still the elder of the family's birthday, so—
- Never mind.

35
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,900
Once Secretary Hong comes, sign the contract and leave immediately.

36
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,270
Forget it! I found a way back!

37
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,160
With that, I can go back to Joseon.

38
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,580
A light shone from that, and I saw all of Hanyang—

39
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,930
Look! It is Joseon.

40
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,880
Now, if I just enter there—

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,380
We should swim a bit.

42
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,840
- Could not regain his smile—
- The square—

43
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,350
Why is this...

44
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,430
Between the apartments and buildings...

45
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,610
Are you kidding me? This is a TV, and all that you saw was fake.

46
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,290
No, that was really Hanyang...

47
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,990
Stop with your nonsense!

48
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,680
No, I really came from Joseon.

49
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,990
What's your proof? Can you prove it rationally?

50
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,180
Then, can you rationally prove that I am not from Joseon?

51
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,720
And you have proof of that?

52
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,660
Rational proof, my foot. You cannot even prove it yourself.

53
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,520
And I am not "you" but Park Yeon Woo.

54
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,650
Yeon Woo of the Park family, you trickster!

55
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,910
Trickster?

56
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,730
[Episode 3 - She is a harmful woman!]

57
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,010
Look at the way he speaks.

58
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,810
Who cares if he looks like my husband?

59
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,400
His personality is completely different!

60
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,430
Why do I keep meeting familiar faces?

61
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,540
The flowers are still the same.

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,780
Yeah. It's there.

63
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,760
Deputy CEO, what happened? Why is the car...

64
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,410
Did you get hurt?

65
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,600
We should go to the hospital. Let's immediately go to the hospital!

66
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,100
It's not like that. What about the contract?

67
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,540
I have it here, but we should go to the hospital first!

68
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,060
Yeon Woo is upstairs, so go and get her signature.

69
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,300
Oh, okay.

70
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,190
Gosh...

71
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,760
Why is the TV like that?

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,220
I'll go get her signature first.

73
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,780
Deputy CEO, Park Yeon Woo is not here.

74
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,480
It was a tall house where you could see the palace...

75
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,380
I feel like I can find it if I get close to it.

76
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,770
Let me ask you something.

77
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,420
Okay.

78
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,010
What must I do to go to Gyeongbokgung Palace?

79
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,100
This is...

80
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,820
We are almost there. You do have money. Right?

81
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,680
I do not have money, but I have something more valuable.

82
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,510
This is a valuable drink called tarak that the king drinks.

83
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,400
Gosh, seriously.

84
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,470
She seemed to recognize me.

85
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,070
And she seemed to be quite uncomfortable with me.

86
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,200
Everyone finds it difficult to be around you, CEO. Your face is just so scary—

87
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,960
Your face is just so scary full of intelligence and beauty, yes.

88
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,100
But was she really an adoptee?

89
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,570
I just don't get why the Chairman chose her as his granddaughter-in-law.

90
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,820
You can't be sure about that, either.

91
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,520
Since we found no info on her apart from her name.

92
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,810
Pardon? Really?

93
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,090
- Secretary Choi.
- It was impossible to check through all possible avenues.

94
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,430
One thing's for certain.

95
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,090
Father used Tae Ha's wedding as an excuse to begin his process of choosing an heir.

96
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,290
We must stop that.

97
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,390
Yes, we must. Don't worry.

98
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,070
I will make sure to keep the directors in check and watch them internally.

99
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,350
Cross-check everyone that Secretary Hong met recently and bring it to me.

100
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,140
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,310
But what is her name?

102
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,800
Yeon Woo of the Park family.

103
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,080
Park Yeon Woo...

104
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,030
What is your home address? You have a cell phone. Right?

105
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,270
I have a home, but it's very far in this new Joseon.

106
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,600
And what is a cell...

107
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
Ma'am, it will become a problem if you act like this here.

108
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,550
That is why I'm curious. Where is this place, exactly?

109
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,060
- Gosh, let go of me!
- Okay, okay.

110
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,760
- I said, let go of me!
- Sit over here.

111
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,530
What the?

112
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,290
By chance, is this a place where you interrogate criminals?

113
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,720
Kind of like a podocheong?
(Old Korean term for police bureau)

114
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,990
Podocheong?

115
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,750
Yes, since it is a police station, it is similar.

116
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,950
Why does she keep disappearing?

117
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,450
And why now of all times?

118
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,700
You got caught by CEO Min and Tae Min,

119
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,090
and Chairman Kang's birthday is coming up, too.

120
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,270
Are you an idiot, Deputy CEO?

121
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,040
You should have cut her off when it came to the Chairman's birthday!

122
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,100
If you fall for CEO Min's obvious trap—

123
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,770
Are you going to keep going?

124
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,260
I will go that way and look for her.

125
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,420
Park Yeon Woo!

126
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,520
It's her, right? The one they were looking for before.

127
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,300
Is it?

128
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,100
Yeah, right. Hong Seong Pyo.

129
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,520
Hong Seong Pyo.

130
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,710
I cannot believe I am about to be imprisoned.

131
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,210
No. I cannot let this happen.

132
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,600
Hello, Hong Seong Pyo. This is Gwanghwamun Police Station.

133
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,870
You know how last time,

134
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,450
- Delivery!
- you left us a photo saying you were looking for someone.

135
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,720
I think she is in our station right now.

136
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,190
I'm sorry!

137
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,570
O-Oh! Stop right there!

138
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,430
S-S-Stop her!

139
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,820
Goodness!

140
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,730
- Hey, bring the car!
- Oh, okay!

141
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,750
Yes.

142
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,420
I just got a call from Gwanghwamun Police Station.

143
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,040
Where? Gwanghwamun?

144
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,020
[Gwanghwamun / Gyeongokgung Palace / Seoul Station]

145
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,990
- All right!
- Gosh, that was so close!

146
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,880
It's Grandpa's turn now! Hold it.

147
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,490
This one. It's this one.

148
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,310
This one, this one, this one.

149
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,410
- Gosh, not again.
- Yay!

150
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,990
All right, try it. I missed it!

151
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,380
Let's see it.

152
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,150

It's this one. Wait.

155
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,350
Oh, my god!

156
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,120
Look at your clothes!

157
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,700
Are you filming a movie or something?

158
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,460
If you're going to steal, why can't you do it normally?

159
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,110
Father, don't be like that and give me a cafe to run.

160
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,810
So I can learn to be more independent.

161
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,620
Why? Shall I make you independent from our family register altogether? You moron of a girl.

162
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,600
Why should I give you a cafe to run when you waste money whenever I give it to you?

163
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,330
Wait! Did you cause trouble again?

164
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,760
It's so pretty. I want it, too.

165
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,010
Just wait a little longer, kids.

166
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,970
Do it for me, too. It's so pretty.

167
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,210
- I want to do it quickly, too.
- Here.

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,270
Let's go, Yeon Woo.

177
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,640
You can return through here.

178
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,340
Park Yeon Woo!

179
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,280
Goodbye!

180
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,660
I am going back to Joseon.

181
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,820
Save me!

182
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,620
Save m—

183
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,420
Save me!

184
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,380
- Save, save—
- Yeon Woo—

185
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,350
Stop!

186
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,420
I said stop!

187
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,820
Are you trying to kill me?

188
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,980
That isn't it. I was just too scared.

189
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,130
So, why did you jump in the water again?

190
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,400
We brought this crepe-myrtle tree here on the year you were born.

191
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,530
Here you are.

192
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,150
- I grew this much.
- I prayed every day for your

193
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,930
and this crepe-myrtle tree's health.

194
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,170
Yeon Woo, you are like that.

195
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,020
You are so precious to your grandfather and your parents.

196
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,290
Someone we have given all of our hearts to.

197
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,570
This was where my house was.

198
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,920
Why do you keep doing whatever you want?

199
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,180
I said I will help you in whatever way possible. I just don't understand.

200
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,700
All day today, no...

201
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,860
Ever since I met you, do you know how much

202
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,250
my daily routine has been ruined by you?

203
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,150
I know.

204
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,770
I know, but... I have no choice.

205
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,180
For you, it may just be a few days of your routine,

206
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,810
but my whole life has changed.

207
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,090
Everything in my life...

208
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,230
my existence...

209
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,770
my world completely disappeared.

210
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,270
♫ I sat there helplessly for a while ♫

211
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,730
♫ and thought of your face ♫

212
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,000
I really do not know...

213
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,370
why I came here...

214
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,560
and how I can return...

215
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,790
♫ Our days are scattered and thrown away ♫

216
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,940
♫ I thought I was lucky it was just a dream ♫

217
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,310
Father...

218
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:01,540
♫ Why is that day now in front of me? ♫

219
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,140
So, what do you think now that you've seen her?

220
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,340
Yeon Woo is pretty good. Right?

221
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,440
She was quite impressive in many aspects.

222
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,230
She suits Tae Ha quite well.

223
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,390
Yeah. Well, that's good.

224
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,870
But why did you tell her to come for my birthday?

225
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,670
She probably has a lot to get used to. We could have taken things slow.

226
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,910
But she's still a new family member. She should at least say hello.

227
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,530
There are some things to teach her, too.

228
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,220
Well, okay. I suppose you're right.

229
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,960
Especially since she and Tae Ha will become SH's new faces.

230
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,620
All right. Great work. You should go and rest.

231
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm a bit tired, too.

232
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,090
Get some rest.

233
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,250
Did you know...

234
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,860
this place used to be west of Hanseongbu and was called Hwanghwa-bang?

235
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,090
And that tree is a crepe-myrtle tree.

236
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,720
I am okay since I didn't get too wet.

237
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,930
It is enough to get the car seats wet.

238
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,170
Wipe yourself dry well. I hate my car getting dirty.

239
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,510
Yoon Ahm?

240
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,150
Yoon Ahm?

241
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,950
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

242
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,850
I am coming.

243
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,430
[Contract]

244
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,880
[Congrats on entering school]

245
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:14,240
Tae Ha, it is just you and me in this world.

246
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,400
You are all I have now.

247
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,840
So, from now on, you and I have to trust and protect each other. Okay?

248
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,690
Since we are... on the same team.

249
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,230
Okay?

250
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,640
[We are one team]

251
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,340
[We are one team]

252
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,000
[We are one team]

253
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,840
What now?

254
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,460
Did you pray to go back to Joseon again?

255
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,120
I prayed for the peace and prosperity of the new Joseon.

256
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,230
Thank you for earlier...

257
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,090
for saving me again at the swimming pool.

258
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,980
Thank you for the early thanks.

259
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,220
I'm sorry about the late thanks.

260
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,040
Park Yeon Woo.

261
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,520
Are you good at lying?

262
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,440
I do it when I need to and do it well.

263
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,660
So let's try it.

264
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,740
What are you talking about?

265
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,780
Let me propose this officially.

266
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,400
Let's get married.

267
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,650
So, you want to have a proper contract marriage?

268
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,250
Yes, all you have to do is act as my wife for just one month.

269
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,350
Only when I need you to, of course.

270
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,870
The details are simple.

271
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,830
First, you will follow my way of life, no matter what.

272
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,580
Am I your pet dog? Follow it no matter what? I refuse.

273
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,570
Then let's take out the "no matter what" part.

274
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,080
Then I accept it.

275
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,000
Second, you will not meet with my family privately.

276
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,150
I refuse to serve as a daughter-in-law, so I accept that.

277
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,500
Third, you will keep secrets.

278
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,540
Fourth, do not speak of Joseon in front of others.
[Do not...]

279
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,300
Fifth, do not go out except in special cases.
[Do not...]

280
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,620
Sixth, anyone you know...
[Do not...]

281
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,010
You will not, you will not, you will not.
[Do not...]

282
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,410
- Finally...
- Do you even know the meaning of the word "simple"?

283
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,980
When this contract ends one month later, you will leave, no matter what.

284
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,160
Do not worry. That is what I want as well. No matter what!

285
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,220
Then, I will now state my conditions.

286
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,820
Your conditions?

287
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,740
You will help me return home, no matter what.

288
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,010
Second...

289
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,520
You have something else?

290
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,690
[Contract]

291
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,720
This is yours, Yeon Woo.

292
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,600
Looks good. Then I look forward to—

293
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,700
I look forward to working with you.

294
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,530
Let's keep our promise and do this.

295
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,100
All right.

296
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,170
♫ When I look at you for a while ♫

297
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,390
♫ All my thoughts disappear and it feels strange ♫

298
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:22,490
♫ I wanted to run away from this unfamiliar feeling ♫

299
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:27,500
♫ I feel like such a fool ♫

300
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,440
One, you will help me return home, no matter what.

301
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,780
Second, you will provide me with meals and snacks, especially Choco.

302
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,400
Third, you will call me by my name.

303
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,890
Fourth, you will teach me about the new Joseon well.

304
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,500
Fifth, you will not mistreat me, who was raised like a princess!

305
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,450
Goodness.

306
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,470
With a man I don't even know...

307
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,370
No. I cannot die away from home before I return.

308
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,070
Though he is a trickster, he does look similar to my husband.

309
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,190
It should be fine.

310
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,990
Park Yeon Woo, let's go back home. No matter what.

311
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,830
Enjoy the food.

312
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,660
Thank you.

313
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,860
It's so pretty, it's so pretty.

314
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,800
So, you want me to let your mother handle the Hwajeopdo exhibit?

315
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,930
Why? Are you scared of running into her?

316
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,310
No, I don't want the rumors to spread, and I can demonstrate my skills without that.

317
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,910
Then why does our mall need the Hwajeopdo?

318
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,830
I guess the ambassador's wife was a fan of Artist Yoon Ahm.

319
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,650
Her major was also art.

320
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:53,250
We need a lot of help from American VIPs to get SH into the New York branch.

321
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:58,200
You've already assessed everything, and yet you made it seem like it was so bad.

322
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,550
It is also a skill and talent to take credit for a job already done.

323
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,100
You should just think about SH.

324
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,360
If you don't like people saying things, then shut them up.

325
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,740
You can't protect the company or me if you don't even have that kind of boldness.

326
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,530
I understand.

327
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,000
Eat.

328
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,430
Let's eat.

329
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,840
All right, Patient. Don't move.

330
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,590
We will do a cardiac catheterization.

331
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,240
You say your heart beats irregularly?

332
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,250
Based on the tests, not much has changed.

333
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,410
When do you usually experience that?

334
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,690
- What is it? Did you fall in love with a girl?
- Pardon?

335
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,610
Don't be surprised. I asked if you've met a woman who is harmful to your heart.

336
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,360
No. It's just...

337
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,520
Keep track of when you experience it for now.

338
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,800
If it keeps happening, we'll do a detailed examination.

339
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,350
Okay.

340
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,540
If you know yourself and your enemy, you will always be on solid footing.

341
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,960
What is this?

342
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,650
is this a cotton fabric?

343
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,830
The vacuum will start.

344
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,970
What is that?

345
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,420
Don't come!

346
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,700
Don't come here! Go away!

347
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,880
Go away!

348
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,110
Go away!

349
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,950
The vacuum app has started.

350
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,210
Gosh, that thing...

351
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,250
How dare you! Stop right there!

352
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,050
You dare eat my Choco! How dare you!

353
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,770
Why is this not opening?

354
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,160
Open!

355
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,870
Mother...

356
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,590
Sa Wol...

357
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,930
Let's see... How much...

358
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,800
Yes, Deputy CEO.

359
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,880
I'm almost there.

360
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,850
Yes, yes.

361
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,240
Secretary Hong.

362
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,580
Secretary Hong?

363
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,790
I just met a martial arts master.

364
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,890
- Deputy CEO!
-Wow! Wow! Amazing!

365
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,640
Did you hear? Did you hear?

366
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,950
Supposedly, Kang Dro is handling the VIP Hwajeopdo exhibit.

367
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,380
Seok Jae, did you fall asleep somewhere?

368
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,610
Why are you speaking such nonsense?

369
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,790
CEO Min had called dibs on it long ago, and yet Kang Dro is handling it?

370
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,360
It's true. I heard directly from my colleague who is on that team.

371
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,830
If that is true, I will wager my wrist and not just 5 million but 50 million won.

372
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,740
What are you doing?

373
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,680
Team Leader Oh?

374
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,640
You should be careful with your wrist.

375
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,790
We will finish the Hwajeopdo exhibit.

376
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,870
I know we don't have much time, but please do your best to take over the project.

377
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,650
I've found some data on Artist Yoon Ahm. Should I organize them into a file?

378
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,530
You're quick at everything, Deputy Yoo. All right, please do so.

379
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,610
What's going on all of a sudden?

380
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,440
What is this?

381
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,750
CEO Min just got pushed out? Really?

382
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,290
Team Leader, when will you give me the 50 million won?

383
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,720
You can wire me the money, too.

384
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,370
But when did you prepare the data on Yoon Ahm, Ha Na?

385
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,470
There was something the marketing team asked for.

386
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,440
Amazing.

387
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,490
Park Yeon Woo?

388
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,660
There is a monster that eats my Choco at home.

389
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,990
So, are you saying this is a tool that can clean all by itself?

390
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,080
Yes.

391
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,110
That is quite amazing.

392
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,580
All right! From now on, your name is Dol Swe.

393
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,120
Park Yeon Woo, do you know anything?

394
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,740
I know quite a lot.

395
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,570
I completed Sohak at age 7 and mastered the Four Books and the Three Classics at age 10.
(Confucianism for children)

396
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,040
I learned a new thing today.

397
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,830
Look. If I pull one out, another one pops out.

398
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,650
If I pull one out, another pops out!

399
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,760
I can buy all this with just this small thing...

400
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,160
It is such a strange world.

401
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,370
I will use this well.

402
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,720
I will send Secretary Hong when busy things are taken care of.

403
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,870
So, buy what you need then.

404
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,540
I will borrow your clothes until then, trickster guy.

405
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,900
The fabric is soft and very easy to move around in.

406
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
It is perfect.

407
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,190
Seeing how the moon is round, it must be a full moon.

408
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,660
No, it's not a full moon.

409
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,100
The full moon for the lunar calendar is still a few days later.

410
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,260
Trickster guy,

411
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,640
you have no friends.

412
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,320
I don't.

413
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,210
How did you know?

414
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,420
I'd be a fool if I didn't know.

415
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,340
Did you know?

416
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,120
There is a moon rabbit living on that moon?

417
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,160
My father once told me that only to me.

418
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,170
Moon rabbit?

419
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,760
Your father?

420
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:03,250
My father's family home is in Hamyang, and his name is Park Jae Won.

421
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,980
He was the Minister of General Affairs.

422
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,450
I told you.

423
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,760
I grew up like a princess as the daughter of a nobleman.

424
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,110
You really... are a princess.

425
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,380
Look here! Take me with you!

426
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,030
How's your heart?

427
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,110
How is the harmful woman?

428
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,220
Harmful woman, my foot.

429
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,910
She's like a princessy princess.

430
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,710
Trickster guy, how do you make Dol Swe move?

431
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,730
The door!

432
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,690
[SH]

433
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,240
We decided to exhibit Yoon Ahm's Hwajeopdo in order to show

434
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,290
our sincerity to our customers and to the world.

435
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:51,330
Will this exhibit become the bridgehead for opening the New York branch of SH?

436
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,990
They're just having a blast.

437
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,380
SH entering New York is important, of course.

438
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,600
- However, personally, this event will be good...
- What is he, the CEO or something?

439
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,750
- for the cultural exchange of the two countries.
- Will you just watch and do nothing?

440
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,830
CEO.

441
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,640
So are you saying that the Hwajeopdo are fakes?

442
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,710
Did you check for sure?

443
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,180
Yes. I confirmed separately with the curator.

444
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,180
I cross-checked as well.

445
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,300
I had my doubts since there are so many imitation works of Yoon Ahm.

446
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,490
How dare President Yoon do that to me!

447
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,420
What should we do?

448
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,930
Tae Ha is in charge of it anyway.

449
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,860
Just bring the curator to me.

450
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,390
Okay, got it.

451
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,010
This piece is supposed to be placed here. Right?

452
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,930
Yes, that's right.

453
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,980
Then, that's done. Next.

454
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,360
This is Yoon Ahm's Hwajeopdo. Right?

455
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,260
Oh, yes.

456
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,230
It is beautiful, as I've heard.

457
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,330
Since we've checked the artwork, you can send them to our exhibit.

458
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,360
Okay, got it.

459
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,510
- Seok Joo.
- Yes?

460
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,450
Let's move on.

461
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,040
Are you going somewhere?

462
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,290
If you've played enough, come to work starting next week.

463
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,420
I told you company work is boring.

464
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,120
Will things change if I do?

465
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,090
In the end, SH is Kang Tae Ha's anyway.

466
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,320
Grandpa isn't interested in giving it to us. Don't you know?

467
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,280
I told you. You should come to your senses to get what little that is yours.

468
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,470
Tae Ha doesn't think of you as a threat anyway.

469
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,610
Then why are you trying so hard to get me to work at the company?

470
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,220
For the crime of giving birth to you.

471
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,090
Is that reason enough for you?

472
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,250
Crime?

473
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,940
Don't reveal your anger too easily.

474
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,330
If you have to, make sure someone else gets hurt, not you.

475
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,230
That worked out.

476
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,130
It was so boring, anyway.

477
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,760
You're absolutely out to suck my Jae Cheol dry, aren't you!

478
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,980
What did you do to Jae Cheol?

479
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,870
What did you seduce him with?

480
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,220
Can't you tell from looking?

481
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,470
It's because I'm pretty.

482
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,980
Because I'm so darned pretty.

483
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,290
- What did you say?
- I guess you got it made in new Joseon as well if you're pretty.

484
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:30,460
You think you can just say whatever?

485
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,350
You dare dodge?

486
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,140
- The money is less than I thought.
- Dol Swe.

487
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,690
- This is an emergency situation, right?
- I'll give this to you,

488
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,670
so use it as your spending money.

489
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,770
Where are you going, Mourning Clothes?

490
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,400
What is this? You're not wearing mourning clothes today.

491
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,690
- Who are you?
- What's with you, Sister-in-law?

492
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,960
Never mind. Go somewhere with me.

493
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,420
No, I am busy right now.

494
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,300
The money envelope you threw at me last time...

495
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,610
That really hurt.

496
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,390
What's with you and Kang Tae Ha?

497
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,970
Like a contract marriage or something like that?

498
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,740
What do you mean by that?

499
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,620
If you're curious, then follow me.

500
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,450
Or shall I do however I please?

501
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,760
Where are you going?

502
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,700
You think I'll eat you alive?

503
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,180
Aren't your eyes tired?

504
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,230
Tell me where you're going.

505
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,810
If you don't, I will get out.

506
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,890
Really?

507
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,630
Hey, that would be fun.

508
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,790
How much are you supposed to get from Kang Tae Ha?

509
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,750
What have you been saying since earlier?

510
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,290
Your brother and I got married because we like each other.

511
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:12,210
Gosh, dating virgin Kang Tae Ha likes you, Mourning Clothes? Why?

512
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,240
What do you mean, why? It's because...

513
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,650
I'm so darned pretty.

514
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,100
What?

515
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,570
What part of you is pretty?

516
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,490
Gosh, you're pretty funny.

517
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,190
Where... is this place?

518
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,600
You don't even know where your beloved husband works?

519
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,670
This is Kang Tae Ha's company.

520
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,410
W-What?

521
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,010
I will be going.

522
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,630
If you keep doing this, I'll go to CEO Min instead of Kang Tae Ha.

523
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,080
Why are you doing this?

524
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,230
It's fun. Making things awkward for whoever it is.

525
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,390
Let go of me!

526
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,730
Did you get hurt?

527
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,760
Forget it!

528
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,740
Just hold still.

529
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,560
If you neglect it, it will get infected. Be sure to show it to a physician and get treated.

530
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,220
And... did you drop your manners somewhere?

531
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,430
How could you call your older brother Kang Tae Ha? That is so rude!

532
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,050
Watch out from now on, Troublemaker!

533
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,220
Hey, stop right there, Mourning Clothes!

534
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,900
Mr. Hong?

535
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,850
Damn it.

536
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,000
[To the exhibit]

537
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,660
Mr. Hong.

538
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,500
Oh! Why are you here...

539
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,850
How did you come here?

540
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,520
T-The thing is, Troublemaker—

541
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,570
What are you doing right now?

542
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,140
Secretary Hong, why is Park Yeon Woo here?

543
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,220
- Well...
- Did you call her here, Secretary Hong?

544
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,540
No, I didn't! I met her just now!

545
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,700
Leave this place right now because there is an important event happening.

546
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,060
Didn't you hear me?

547
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,120
Park Yeon Woo!

548
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,190
This is Yoon Ahm's painting?

549
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,120
Secretary Hong, take her out of here immediately.

550
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,630
Then, this painting is a fake.

551
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,710
Hey, Park Yeon Woo—

552
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,000
Yoon Ahm's seal does not look like this.

553
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
- Her brushstrokes look different, too.
- How would you know that?

554
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,510
That is because I'm from Joseon—

555
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,700
I know you think I speak nonsense,

556
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,860
but believe me.

557
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,270
This is definitely not Yoon Ahm's.

558
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,360
What about Kang Dro?

559
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,570
Why isn't he here yet after gathering the VIPs?

560
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,510
I don't know.

561
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,830
Should I call Secretary Hong?

562
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:35,240
Do you think Kang Dro had a digestion problem or was just drained?

563
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,610
Oh! Seok Joo.

564
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,590
- Yes?
- Do you want to die?

565
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,300
Do you really want to say that at a time like this?

566
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,800
Team Leader.

567
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,690
Let's go.

568
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,870
So, CEO Min knows this is an imitation artwork?

569
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,350
I'm sorry.

570
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,970
The CEO told me not to tell anyone.

571
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,150
Yes, Team Leader Oh.

572
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,990
Already?

573
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,470
The VIPs are here.

574
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:11,170
You should explain the situation honestly first—

575
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,470
No, we can't.

576
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,790
Then what? We can't leave the fake here, and we don't have a real painting, either!

577
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,330
There is one!

578
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,550
A real painting by Yoon Ahm.

579
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,790
How are you today, sir?

580
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,500
Very well, thank you. And how are you?

581
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,200
I'm good, thank you.

582
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,030
It's a great honor to meet you.

583
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:46,240
I'm Seong Pyo Hong, Secretary of Tae Ha Kang, Vice Chairman of SH Seoul.

584
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,140
Please allow me to escort you to a special event Mr. Kang has prepared.

585
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,030
- An event?
- A special event?

586
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,480
- Could be fun.
- Event?

587
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,850
- Could be.
- Was there something like that?

588
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,700
Based on our commitment to preserving and promoting our cultural heritage,

589
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,290
we have designated a special space for international clients

590
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,330
to immerse themselves in our traditions.

591
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,950
Buy me just 30, no, just 40 minutes.

592
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:22,210
Prevent the VIPs from coming into the exhibit hall until I bring in the painting.

593
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,820
The VIPs went to a different place and not the exhibit hall?

594
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,810
It appears the Deputy CEO found out it was a fake as well.

595
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:34,270
So he will try to stall for time...

596
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,730
Park Yeon Woo, are you sure Yoon Ahm's painting was in that box?

597
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,530
I'm sure. I definitely saw it, though it was just in passing.

598
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,610
Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha? I was waiting for you after receiving your call.

599
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,890
Did you look for the box that I mentioned?

600
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,480
Oh, yes. But...

601
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:14,230
Good afternoon. I am Hye Sook Min, CEO of SH Seoul.

602
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,280
May I have the honor of escorting you to the exhibition area?

603
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,290
The Deputy CEO will be here soon, though.

604
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,500
Please come.

605
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,350
Yoon Ahm's painting...

606
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,410
is really here somewhere.

607
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,390
Yes?

608
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,930
CEO Min did that already?

609
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,580
Okay.

610
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,220
Let's go now.

611
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,940
Here's that painting.

612
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,730
My goodness, is this the Hwajeopdo of Yoon Ahm?

613
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,390
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,680
Here it is.

615
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,330
What?

616
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,520
Where's the painting?

617
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,330
I don't know. There's no painting on display.

618
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:42,380
Excuse me. What's going on?

619
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,590
Oh, I'm sorry.

620
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:50,140
Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience.

621
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,980
Yoon Ahm's Hwajeopdo turned out to be a forgery

622
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,450
and was promptly removed.

623
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,000
A forgery? What do you mean by a forgery?

624
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,200
CEO, what do you mean it's a fake?

625
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,430
May I request your presence in my office?

626
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:10,290
I'm confident that we can provide you with a satisfactory explanation.

627
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,370
Okay.

628
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,330
Please.

629
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,380
What's going on? Why is Kang Dro not here?

630
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,630
I don't know, either.

631
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,750
Oh, Kang Dro!

632
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,400
Pleased to meet you. I'm Tae Ha Kang.

633
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,900
Please accept my apologies for being so late.

634
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,830
It is my pleasure to formally introduce to you all

635
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:51,650
the masterpiece painting created by Yoon Ahm.

636
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:23,350
- I said let's go.
- We should look for whatever we can.

637
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,320
It's here!

638
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,110
- Is that it?
- I don't know, wow.

639
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,540
It's pretty good, yes.

640
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,650
- This is beautiful.
- Wonderful.

641
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:06,950
That is really gorgeous.

642
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,820
It's so much better in real life.

643
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,930
It's amazing. Look at that.

644
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,510
You like it? I can't believe you brought me here to see it.

645
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,280
- Really good.
- That's so true.

646
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,100
Now, how did they do that?

647
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,540
Then, I hope you get home comfortably.

648
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,690
Thank you. I hope to see you again.

649
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,020
From now, I will guide you.

650
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,830
You're impressive, Deputy CEO Kang.

651
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,930
But is that painting really genuine?

652
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,900
Of course.

653
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:50,420
I just told our American business partners that it was a surprise event.

654
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,710
There's no need to plant an image of the CEO of SH Seoul trying to

655
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,150
sabotage SH's entrance into the US.

656
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,460
Yeah, you did well.

657
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,650
You did well, Deputy CEO Kang.

658
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:15,640
At this rate, you would have no problems opening the New York branch.

659
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,240
Oh, why don't we also leave the one-year opening anniversary event to him?

660
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,390
You're right.

661
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,730
You can entrust him with it now.

662
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:25,980
You're right.

663
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,390
- You must feel good to have his support, Chairman.
- Of course. Oh, yes.

664
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,540
You did really well, Deputy CEO Kang.

665
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,510
I want to be alone. Get out!

666
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,530
There's something you have to see right now.

667
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,620
What is this supposed to be?

668
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,360
She is the woman who almost married Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha.

669
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:05,820
Do what... with Tae Ha?

670
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,370
[Deputy CEO Kang Tae Ha]

671
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,780
Kang Tae Ha!

672
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,260
Hey, Kang Tae Min, what are you doing?

673
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,810
Do I need permission to walk on my own two feet?

674
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:47,730
I was looking for something.

675
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,930
A white street cat.

676
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,590
We're at a company, and this is my office.

677
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,010
Should I call someone?

678
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,980
Okay, I'm leaving.

679
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,380
I need to go to the hospital for this, anyway.

680
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,890
Oh, also...

681
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,900
I let it slide last time, but don't misbehave with Park Yeon Woo.

682
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,460
She is my wife.

683
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,750
I won't let you off twice.

684
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,920
Wife?

685
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,960
Not sure about that...

686
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,360
Depending on how you behave.

687
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,500
Coming here makes me feel like I'm back home.

688
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,680
What happened?

689
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,270
Why did you come to the office?

690
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:01,200
I heard that Yoon Ahm's painting was there and wanted to see it.

691
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,190
I was going to tell you, but you should watch out for my family members.

692
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:09,930
Tae Min is unpredictable, and CEO Min is dangerous.

693
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,320
I can get the general picture.

694
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,540
You must be a bit distressed internally, trickster guy.

695
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:20,500
But still, thank you for today.

696
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:25,230
Thank you... for your quick thanks.

697
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,240
But how did you know?

698
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,420
I'm talking about the painting.

699
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,300
That's only natural,

700
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,170
since Yoon Ahm is... my friend.

701
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:55,780
She brought such a small amount of money to buy her daughter's wedding dress

702
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:01,570
and gave me a painting, feeling bad about it. And it was so beautiful.

703
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:16,690
Thank you. Thank you.

704
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,220
Thank you.

705
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:28,820
It was such a shame to see her talent

706
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,980
caged by her being a woman...

707
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,260
and her social class,

708
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,810
so I wanted to become her friend.

709
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,110
I cherished the Hwajeopdo she gifted me then.

710
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,430
It's beautiful.

711
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:53,170
I saw it again at the place called a hotel, where my house used to be.

712
00:57:55,190 --> 00:58:00,520
I was the one who named her Yoon Ahm and gave her the seal,

713
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,860
so she would live a solid life like a rock.

714
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,400
Do you know why Yoon Ahm's Hwajeopdo is so lightly colored?

715
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,030
It is because she used her dyes so sparingly!

716
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,320
Although I said I would buy more for her, she was so frugal.

717
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,290
Fine! It's all a lie, a blatant lie!

718
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,950
I didn't say anything.

719
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,130
What is all this?

720
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:44,690
Is this all for me?

721
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:52,200
What's wrong?

722
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,420
It appears you also eat yoolran in new Joseon as well.

723
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,330
Mother used to really like these...

724
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,590
Then it should be even more delicious.

725
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:31,750
I should have a drink at a time like this.

726
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,120
- Will it be all right with you?
- No, thank you, I don't drink.

727
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,010
I will drink it! I will. I will drink it all!

728
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,690
Excuse me.

729
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,590
It smells expensive.

730
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,580
That was so funny.

Oh, it's the trickster guy.

It's late. Let's go.

735
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,220
Do you know this?

736
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,510
Today...

737
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:36,960
I felt so full right here.

738
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,580
I wanted to help you.

739
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:47,500
I really wanted to become that moon rabbit...

740
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:52,730
for you at least once, trickster guy.

741
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:57,310
Since you saved me and took me in

742
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:00,530
when I dropped out of nowhere,

743
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:06,140
I wanted to do something for you, whether granting a small wish or helping you.

744
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,400
Whatever it may be.

745
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,860
To be exact, we made a deal rather than take you in.

746
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,050
So, we need to finish this without having any losses.

747
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,920
Still, today was...
