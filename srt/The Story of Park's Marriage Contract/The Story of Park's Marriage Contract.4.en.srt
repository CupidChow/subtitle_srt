Will you run away this time, too?

Park Yeon Woo?

Are you reading web novels again?

8
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,440
It is a romantic episode where the male and female protagonists first kiss

9
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,830
and can't fall asleep all night.

10
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,760
Why can't they fall asleep just because they kissed once?

11
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,390
Is it a 1988's romance comic?

Are you a T?

13
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,570
It's mouth-to-mouth.

Hey, Mister. Quit your fantasy romance and live in the real world!

15
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,410
Yeah, no.

16
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,050
There's no one like that these days.

17
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,310
It was just an accident.

18
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,350

Park Yeon Woo, why are you acting like this!

26
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,040
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

27
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,450
It's been a while since I drank.

28
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,630
I got it. Let's stop talking about this.

29
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,410
Were you not hurt? I suddenly rushed at you.

30
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,300
Forget it.

31
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,380
Whenever I get drunk, I tend to do that very well.

32
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,150
W-What do you mean you do it well?

33
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,660
I said, forget it!

34
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,170
Did it hurt a lot?

35
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,980
Why do I keep headbutting things...

36
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,340
whenever I get drunk?

37
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,540
- My Sa Wol...
- Yes?

38
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,280
Goodness, so pretty, my Sa Wol!

39
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,510
Goodness.

40
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,950
So pretty.

41
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,370
You said I'm pretty, so why...

42
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,850
Sa Wol!

43
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,370
Okay. I'll be more careful from now on.

44
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,700
- Get me a coffee, too.
- Okay.

45
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,040
Why are you drinking that in the morning? It'll hurt your stomach.

46
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,180
You should just eat food.

47
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,270
But it's nice to have everyone here like this. It's been a while.

48
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,140
We didn't put you in a good mood, Father.

49
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,160
It's because of Tae Ha.

50
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,740
I heard he did extremely well with the exhibit.

51
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,560
Sis, you might lose your position like that.

52
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,920
It's good for the company if any one of us does a good job.

53
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,940
Grandfather, I'll start working at the company starting next week.

54
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,090
What?

55
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,150
You? The company? Why?

56
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,000
What do you mean, why?

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,950
I'm also part of SH.

58
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,950
Isn't it natural to take an interest in the company?

59
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,540
What now? Will you fight over the successor position with Tae Ha?

60
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,550
Gosh, should I do that?

61
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,130
That would be fun, too.

62
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,390
I guess you will feel a bit more reassured now, Hye Suk.

63
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,740
What do you mean, reassured? Tae Min is still young.

64
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,010
He can slowly learn things at his own pace.

65
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,920
- Good luck with it.
- Okay.

66
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,080
Kang Tae Min.

67
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,160
What are you thinking out of the blue?

68
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh, the company?

69
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,540
You told me to go and claim my share.

70
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,100
Tell Secretary Choi if you need anything.

71
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,800
But I haven't decided yet who I will side with.

72
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,460
Side?

73
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,410
I told you already that you won't win against Tae Ha.

74
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,380
The same goes against me.

75
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,260
What's with you?

76
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,580
You called me into the company to piss off Tae Ha.

77
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,270
I look forward to working with you.

78
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,870
Don't hurt me like last time, though.

79
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,670
Since it is a special exhibit that will be the main event for our first anniversary of opening,

80
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,400
we can demonstrate SH's new vision...

81
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,170
Whenever I get drunk, I tend to do that very well.

82
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,360
Whenever she gets drunk, she tends to kiss very well?

83
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,120
She definitely has a problem.

84
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,530
How could she kiss...

85
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,070
This is the list of partnering brand candidates.

86
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,260

- Yes?

87
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,890

Oh, I'm sorry!

94
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,420
I-I thought I had it on vibrate.

95
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,680
I'm not saying everything's a no.

96
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,090
Let's reconvene after reviewing it again.

97
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,620
Deputy CEO?

98
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,880
What was that?

99
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,150
I know. My ringtone was so childish. Right?

100
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,950
- My niece changed it without me knowing.
- Not that. Kang Dro.

101
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,240
Was our plan something to go all "No, no!" about?

102
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,460
I just got totally hurt.

103
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,900
I don't think that was about our plan.

104
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,070
He seemed particularly unable to focus today.

105
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,620
- Are you okay, Deputy CEO?
- What are you talking about?

106
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,150
You suddenly got angry. Is something wrong?

107
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,620
I got angry? Me?

108
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,920
That's not true. I'm not.

109
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,640
Huh? Oh, okay.

110
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,540
Oh, right. About Park Yeon Woo—

111
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,170
Park Yeon Woo? Why?

112
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,870
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

113
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,920
Oh, I was thinking about it, and I thought

114
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,540
maybe Yeon Woo was an art student who was really into historical dramas.

115
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,670
An art student?

116
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,490
Yes! She was able to recognize Yoon Ahm's painting right away.

117
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,040
You know what I'm saying?

118
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,540
But she speaks like she's in a historical drama.

119
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,480
After injuring her head, her artistic background and her love for historical drama mixed,

120
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,750
- and she also lost her memories.
- Memory loss...

121
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,850
This should help figure out Park Yeon Woo's condition.

122
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,350
Also, we should decide what I should call her.

123
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,410
Since she married you, calling her Park Yeon Woo would be weird.

124
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,710
It's a bit too much to call her Madam.

125
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,840
How about going with the historical drama tone and calling her Lady Yeon Woo?

126
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,020
Not good?

127
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,830
Ms. Yeon Woo?

128
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,370
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,050
Her name is Kim Ha Young. She is 28 years old.

130
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,180
She is currently unemployed.

131
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,260
Kim Ha Young?

132
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,040
She's the original bride who was supposed to have a contractual marriage with Deputy CEO Kang?

133
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,520
Supposedly. As I'd thought, Tae Ha's marriage was fake.

134
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,440
Then who is that Park Yeon Woo girl?

135
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,830
Supposedly, that girl and Deputy CEO Kang found this painting together.

136
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:20,570
It's strange that the bride suddenly changed, but the new bride found the painting for him?

137
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,570
Who is this woman, Park Yeon Woo?

138
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,600
That doesn't matter anymore.

139
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,550
I'll get rid of her along with Tae Ha anyway.

140
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,290
And with that...

141
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,520
This looks to be difficult to overcome.

142
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,400
Gavi has two more left, and Yoon Chae Won has one left.

143
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,160
Dol Swe!

144
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,260
Dol Swe!

145
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,130
Dol Swe!

146
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,370
Dol Swe—

147
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,960
You're back?

148
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,150
What are you doing?

149
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,160
Where is that?

150
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,460
It was fascinating, so I tried copying them, and it's so fun.

151
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,920
That is so enchanting. I hate studying,

152
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,190
but it's not so bad with that thing.

153
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:22,400
After injuring her head, her artistic background and her love for historical drama mixed, and also lost her memories.

154
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,260
What's wrong?

155
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,620
- If it's about last night—
- No.

156
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,330
You can stop bringing that up now.

157
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,480
Well, okay.

158
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
Park Yeon Woo.

159
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,130
Could you make some time for me tomorrow?

160
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,860
[Seohyeon University Hospital]

161
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,090
So, are you saying this is a medical clinic in new Joseon?

162
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,660
The accurate name for it would be a hospital.

163
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,810
I am perfectly fine and normal, so I have no need to go to a clinic.

164
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,310
If you got that, let's go home.

165
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,330
You can't. I have a responsibility.

166
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,100
Responsibility to help you go back.

167
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,000
And it's my grandfather's birthday soon.

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,330
I must find out your condition before then.

169
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,320
Is everything big in new Joseon like this?

170
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,940
How much would it cost to build something like this?

171
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,380
Ten tile-roofed houses?

172
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,530
Sa Wol would have fallen over if she had seen this.

173
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,350
Sa Wol? Who is that?

174
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,510
There's someone like that. A girl I've known like sisters since childhood.

175
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,880
What did they add to this?

176
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,570
You forgot about milk!

177
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,430
There's nothing wrong with her?

178
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,540
There's nothing wrong with her based on the CT MRI scans.

179
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,170
They show her to be perfectly normal, though her behavior is definitely a bit weird.

180
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,700
- What kind of cave is this?
- Oh, you can't touch that!

181
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,400
Hey, this is moving!

182
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,610
This just moved.

183
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,310
I thought she hurt her head.

184
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,870
She doesn't even have memory loss?

185
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,430
There doesn't seem to be any problems with her brain.

186
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,050
How is your heart? Does it still keep racing these days?

187
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,970
Well, yes.

188
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,120
Let's just get a detailed exam done again to check for a couple of things.

189
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,290
Forget it. Never mind.

190
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,880
But the person with this brain scan.

191
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,850
This isn't the woman harmful to your heart. Right?

192
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,450
No.

193
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,670
She's not.

194
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,470
Really?

195
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,050
I think she is.

196
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,070
No, I really came from Joseon.

197
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,710
- Husband...
- Park Yeon Woo's fingerprint isn't in the records.

198
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,890
It doesn't bring up any results.

199
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,160
Then this painting is a fake.

200
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,750
I cherished the Hwajeopdo she gifted me then. Where my house used to be...

201
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,800
My father's family home is in Hamyang. His name is Park Jae Won.

202
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,330
Secretary Hong, could you check something for me?

203
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,440
Why didn't you wake me up when you came out?

204
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,770
Why were you just watching while I was snoring like that?

205
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,640
I wasn't just watching! You snored before I could wake you up.

206
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,520
Save me...

207
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,680
Are you all right?

208
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,090
Save me...

209
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,850
Mom! Mom, what's wrong?

210
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,680
Mom!

211
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,450
Tae Ha... Tae Ha...

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,550
Tae Ha... Tae Ha...

213
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,680
Please, someone, help!

214
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,350
Over here!

215
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,260
Help!

216
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,870
Is anyone out there?

217
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,590
Help!

218
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,850
Help!

219
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,570
Mom!

220
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,540
Just a little longer.

221
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,890
Trickster guy!

222
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,810
Over here!

223
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,600
No...

224
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,320
You can't call them.

225
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,020
Are you all right?

226
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,420
Wake up!

227
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,030
It is just a temporary sound of a drum beating.

228
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,210
Don't worry.

229
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,800
You will soon get better.

230
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,470
[Secretary Hong]

231
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,600
The meeting?

232
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,180
Okay, Secretary Hong.

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,070
That's weird.

234
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,530
Why? Did something happen with the Deputy CEO?

235
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,610
He's suddenly canceling the meeting because of something else.

236
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,170
What's wrong with Kang Dro these days?

237
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,380
He also lost his temper last time, which is unlike him.

238
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,530
Oh, my. Is he dating?

239
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,040
Dating? No way.

240
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,700
He keeps his public and private life separate.

241
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,080
Is he sick?

242
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,510
He wouldn't have canceled it easily since the meeting was about the first-anniversary event.

243
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,540
Canceled a meeting?

244
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,580
Deputy CEO Kang?

245
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,760
Drum roll, here we go...

246
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,990
Why? Is something the matter?

247
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,150
Kang Dro canceled the meeting.

248
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,780
Our afternoon schedule is postponed for now.

249
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,410
Really? We don't have a meeting today?

250
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,910
Here.

251
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,230
Gosh! Hey!

252
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,920
What was that?

253
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,410
CEO!

254
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,630
Wait, CEO!

255
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,910
- CEO! CEO!
- What is it?

256
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,520
- The thing is—
- Speak to me from there.

257
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,570
- Oh, here. Oh, okay.
- There.

258
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,610
Deputy CEO Kang suddenly canceled a meeting.

259
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,520
- But I looked into it, and he called in after dropping by the hospital.
- The hospital?

260
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,760
Yes! After Secretary Hong and Deputy CEO Kang talked, Secretary Hong raced out the door.

261
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,380
This seems to be a bit fishy, so I think it would be good to find out what they're up to.

262
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,530
Okay.

263
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,420
Yes, have a good day.

264
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,520
Dark chocolate, 70%?

265
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,430
How is he?

266
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,980
I mean, he just fell asleep after taking medication, so don't worry.

267
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,100
That's a relief.

268
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,430
Is Trickster Guy ill?

269
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,100
Does he have a condition?

270
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,590
No. He's so healthy.

271
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,420
I think he had a lot to think about these days, so he must be tired.

272
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,770
The Deputy CEO tends to keep things stored inside.

273
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,410
Yeon Woo...

274
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,470
They are two different people.

275
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,290
Husband smiled often and was warm,

276
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,940
but this guy is sharp and cold.

277
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,120
So... he'll be fine.

278
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,890
Right, Dol Swe?

279
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,440
I came to see Tae Ha. He's inside. Right?

280
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,990
He's not home.

281
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,700
The hospital said he went home.

282
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,250
If he's sick, I should know. I'm his parent.

283
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,860
You got it wrong. He never went to the hospital.

284
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,940
Also, I didn't mention anything last time because it was so hectic,

285
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,340
but Tae Ha doesn't want you to come here, Mother.

286
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,230
- What did you say?
- As his wife, it is my duty to follow my husband's wishes.

287
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,130
Wife? Duty?

288
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,680
Please understand with a generous heart.

289
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,310
- You should move.
- Forget it.

290
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,020
How long will you keep up the married couple act?

291
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,690
You should know who to mess with.

292
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,050
We should start picking up Father's birthday present soon.

293
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:28,510
♫ One day I had a dream ♫

294
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:37,640
♫ I woke up and was in a daze for a long time ♫

295
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,580
Mom...

296
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,580
Mom...

297
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,550
Mom...

298
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,850
​♫ and thought of your face ♫

299
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:57,510
♫ The sight of you getting further away ♫

300
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:03,900
♫ Our days are scattered and thrown away ♫

301
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:12,320
♫ I thought I was lucky it was just a dream ♫

302
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,660
♫ Why is that day now in front of me? ♫

303
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,540
What are you doing up so early?

304
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,760
Wait! Did the sun rise from the west today?

305
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,720
I just tried getting up early today.

306
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,570
I'll be going to work now. So, I just tried practicing.

307
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,970
Oh, okay. Good job.

308
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,600
Then, since you're here, you should pull out some weeds.

309
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,930
Weeds?

310
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,520
Which ones are the weeds?

311
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,280
Weeds?

312
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,700
The ones that pop out among the pretty flowers and don't know their place.

313
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,750
This is a weed.

314
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,560
I see. But weeds will grow back even if you pull them out.

315
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,240
That is why you need to completely uproot it before it grows any further.

316
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,700
So it knows who the real owner of this flowerbed is.

317
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,050
If the company work is difficult, let me know.

318
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,920
I'll do whatever for you, whether it is setting up a cafe or buying you a building.

319
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,650
Whoa, a building owner?

320
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,410
But I want to live like these weeds.

321
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,570
Persistently surviving even if you pull them out. Like a zombie.

322
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,040
Hey! What do you mean, live like a zombie?

323
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,570
Why? It's fun!

324
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,990
Are you awake? How's your physical condition?

325
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,350
Yes, I'm fine now.

326
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,390
I'm sorry about yesterday.

327
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,700
I heard about it briefly from Mr. Hong.

328
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,790
You have been a bit tired recently.

329
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,970
People aren't soybean paste or pepper paste,

330
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,610
so don't keep things fermenting inside you.

331
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,110
I'm saying don't keep things buried in your heart.

332
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,920
Whether it's your family's problem or anything else.

333
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,520
Is that any of your business, Park Yeon Woo?

334
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,680
I was just...

335
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,920
I'm grateful for helping me yesterday, but you shouldn't cross the line.

336
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,420
Whatever I do and what happens around me,

337
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,740
I don't appreciate any unnecessary attention.

338
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,420
Hey, Trickster Guy.

339
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,050
What? Do you have anything more to say?

340
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,080
Must you cut me off when I was just worried about you?

341
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,150
The one to worry about isn't me but you, Park Yeon Woo.

342
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:51,500
It's Grandfather's birthday soon. Can you pull it off in your condition?

343
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,020
You didn't forget about our contract. Right?

344
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,600
You have to act the part of my wife properly.

345
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,670
I told you that my family members are no joke.

346
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,090
I will do it! I will perform exceptionally well!

347
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,680
How?

348
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,490
I will study it. I'll just learn everything I need to know.

349
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,050
Okay. Then I'll prepare you.

350
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,470
Gosh, why does it feel like I lost?

351
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,460
[Kang Sang Mo, Min Hye Sook]

352
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,910
Now, we will start a special training for Chairman Kang's birthday

353
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,110
and adjusting to the new Joseon.

354
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,820
I personally made this story for Deputy CEO's fake marriage.

355
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,290
How you two first met, your dating history, and even Yeon Woo's family tree...

356
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,480
It's all here in this perfect guidebook.
[When Tae Ha Met Yeon Woo]

357
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,570
If you memorize this, it's essentially game over.

358
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,910
Just memorize this. Okay?

359
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,880
[When Tae Ha Met Yeon Woo]

360
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:04,440
T-This is a bit different from the letters that I'm used to...

361
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,930
Let's learn the letters first.

362
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,870
Heart.

363
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,520
Also.

364
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,560
Police.

365
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,570
[Dol Swe]

366
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,760
Kang Tae Min! He is the Deputy CEO's half-brother,

367
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,160
and is an unpredictable lunatic. If he approaches you, just avoid him.

368
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,040
[Kang Tae Min - Deputy CEO's half-brother - Lunatic]

369
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,830
Kang Hae Ryeong! She is the Chairman's only daughter.

370
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,330
Though she is dumb and often makes unexpected remarks—

371
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,230
It's hard. Right?

372
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,480
Studying is like that.

373
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,300
You should eat this chocolate and cheer up.

374
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,210
But there is too much chocolate.

375
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,650
Why must we go to such an extent?

376
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,290
If your contract marriage is found out, we're in big trouble.

377
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,910
It would hurt the Chairman's health,

378
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,950
and Deputy CEO is fighting with CEO Min for the company—

379
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,380
So, basically, it's a battle for the throne, so he can't let her find his weaknesses.

380
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,480
Correct.

381
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,290
Oppa!

382
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,170
Oh, you're here.

383
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,790
- Hello!
- Hello.

384
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,660
It's heavy. Could you carry these for me?

385
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,650
Trickster Guy sent...

386
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,300
Kang Tae Ha sent all this?

387
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,730
Yes.

388
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,290
This is for you to embroider.

389
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,990
I heard you asked for them, Yeon Woo.

390
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,920
Thank you.

391
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,010
Right, I'm sorry about the wedding day.

392
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,700
It's okay. I got paid to do it anyway.

393
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,840
I happen to be a BCP.

394
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,460
A bitch crazy for part-time jobs.

395
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,040
Part-time?

396
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,220
Oh, you're not familiar with our language yet. Right?

397
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,060
A part-timer in historical dramas would be like a slave.

398
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,850
A modern-day slave who works for money.

399
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,560
A slave?

400
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,500
Part-timer, slave.

401
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,910
So, SH Seoul is planning on a collaboration with Midam,

402
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:23,300
the hanbok fashion company for this first-anniversary event.

403
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,370
With this exhibit that portrays CEO Lee Mi Dam's

404
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,200
hanbok collection through media art, paintings, and photos,

405
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,270
there is growing interest in hanbok and our traditional culture

406
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,560
among international art and fashion circles.

407
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,440
Even if it's Midam,

408
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,680
isn't it a bit too lacking to be the main event

409
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,960
for the exhibit for SH's first anniversary of opening?

410
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,630
Who wears a hanbok these days?

411
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,820
Unless you're talking about overseas luxury brands.

412
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,440
That is true about hanbok.

413
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,830
You are right.

414
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,520
That is reasonable.

415
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,180
Everyone likes imported luxury brands.

416
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,300
And it's too cliche.

417
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,820
Though it's cliche, it's pretty.

418
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,350
So, what are your thoughts, Deputy CEO Kang?

419
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,420
We will clothe Midam's symbolism with trendiness and demonstrate SH's new vision.

420
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,330
Is this what people nowadays call national pride?

421
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,020
Whether it's national pride or noise marketing, it's important to reach customers' hearts.

422
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,030
Isn't that technique and skills?

423
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,750
Even the Chairman worked hard to connect Midam to SH.

424
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,050
I believe Midam rejected offers from even a famous department store overseas.

425
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:40,040
I'm thinking of having Midam open shop when the New York branch of SH opens.

426
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,540
Then, I think our New York counterparts will also be quite interested.

427
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:50,100
I think if we succeed in this, the chairman would be very happy.

428
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,120
To open Midam at the New York branch?

429
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,880
Wow, that's amazing.

430
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,110
Isn't it a good idea?

431
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,680
So, did you consult with Midam?

432
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,890
I will do so soon. I've already sent them the proposal.

433
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,060
So, it's in the works...

434
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,130
That means nothing is confirmed then.

435
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:17,370
Since everything starts from zero.

436
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,770
Okay. That's true.

437
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,150
Until you succeed.

438
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,460
If you're done speaking, I'll be going.

439
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,740
Your relationship with your wife seems to be quite good.

440
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,450
You didn't hear about it?

441
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,660
She's not just quick at picking up on things, but she also has heavy lips, I see.

442
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,520
I like that girl, Yeon Woo.

443
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,080
What did you do to her this time?

444
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,980
What did I do?

445
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,660
What did I do!

446
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,330
Watch your words.

447
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,220
I am the CEO here, and at home, I am your mother.

448
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,520
Even death won't ever change that.

449
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:08,140
Well? I suppose we'll only find out once someone dies.

450
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,430
CEO.

451
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,740
I've prepared the gift you mentioned.

452
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,850
I wasn't kidding when I said you should get an examination.

453
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,750
It's not a recommendation but a warning.

454
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,770
I've lived facing death all my life.

455
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,650
I'm a bit tired of...

456
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,240
such warnings now.

457
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,550
Doctor, I am Choi Hyeon Wook, the primary doctor for

458
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,260
patient Kang Tae Ha you performed surgery on five years ago.

459
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,420
There were a few things I wanted to discuss with you.

460
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,800
Did you make a wish to the rabbit that lives on the moon again?

461
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,640
For world peace?

462
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,970
I prayed that I would do well tomorrow.

463
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,430
By chance, did CEO Min come by our house?

464
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,950
She came by on the day we went to the hospital to see you, Trickster Guy.

465
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,810
She bothered you over some personal matters.

466
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,340
It's okay since we have a contract.

467
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,400
Well, you can just think of it as your part-timer slave worked really hard.

468
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,900
Part-timer slave?

469
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,970
You know how to smile?

470
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,610
It was because it was so ridiculous.

471
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,560
I just learned that term...

472
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,820
Let's do well tomorrow.

473
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,620
Do not worry.

474
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:50,450
I know how important your grandfather is to you, Trickster Guy.

475
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,200
Even to the point that you would do this fake marriage.

476
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,150
I can tell from looking at you...

477
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,200
since eyes don't lie.

478
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,380
You just have to do your job.

479
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,690
Don't think about anything else.

480
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,680
I will just do as much as I'm contractually obliged to do,

481
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,590
so you worry about yourself.

482
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,780
I don't know why I need to meet CEO Min.

483
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,820
I mean, I refused Kang Tae Ha's offer and I did nothing wrong.

484
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,270
What makes you think you can decide that by yourself, Kim Ha Young?

485
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,050
That is because I returned all the money I received, and—

486
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,320
So, you did receive money.

487
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,260
That's what matters to me.

488
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,460
So, stop fooling around with me.

489
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,010
Think about it carefully. I won't just let you be like Tae Ha.

490
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,670
I'll call you.

491
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,170
Deputy CEO specially picked this out for you to wear for the Chairman's birthday.

492
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,580
I like the clothes at least.

493
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,460
You're here! You're here!

494
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,160
Welcome! Gosh!

495
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,980
Have you been well?

496
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,490
Happy birthday, Grandfather.

497
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,210
Yes, yes.

498
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,250
With that said, a gam that you can't eat is?
(Korean for persimmon)

499
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,890
It's younggam! (Korean for old man)
Gosh, you got the answer as expected.

500
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,080
Gosh, how lovely you are! Goodness!

501
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,720
You're here, my nephew's wife.

502
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,110
Machon-daek?

503
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,480
Why is Machon-daek here?

504
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,460
You were surprised.

505
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,870
Hello, I am Tae Ha's aunt, though I look really young.

506
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,730
This here is my son, Joon.

507
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,310
Lee Seo Joon.

508
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,900
Hello, Cousin-in-law.

509
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,660
Why? Are you not feeling well?

510
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,600
No, it's just nice to meet them.

511
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:39,740
Cousin-in-law, don't tell my mom that you saw me then. Okay?

512
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,050
Me cutting school.

513
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,270
Don't worry.

514
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,530
It's also a secret that you met me. Okay?

515
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,170
Of course. That's the only way it'll make sense.

516
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,450
We both didn't see each other.

517
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,920
Wow, did you become friends already?

518
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,270
Hey, I'm getting jealous.

519
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,870
Yes, I really like Cousin-in-law.

520
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,440
But where did Mom go?

521
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,050
Shouldn't we continue our unfinished conversation from last time?

522
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,610
Grandfather!

523
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,860
Hey, Sister-in-law, wait for me!

524
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,570
All right, I don't know if this will be to your liking, Granddaughter-in-law.

525
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:33,320
Oh, no. Doahn urumi, sujung-gaek, gaje-yo, hyojonggang.
(Names of traditional Korean foods and soups)

526
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,690
They're all things that I like!

527
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,070
Wait! You said you came from Italy. You know all of this?

528
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,090
Do your parents run a Korean restaurant there?

529
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,880
My parents were a fan of "Jewel in the Palace."

530
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,230
Oh, I see.

531
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,100
Okay, eat up!

532
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,850
Our new housekeeper is really good at cooking.

533
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,860
Let's eat.

534
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:00,200
But how did you manage to seduce my nephew Tae Ha?

535
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,780
The Chairman's only daughter, Kang Hye Ryeong.

536
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,840
Strong against strong, weak against weak. You must respond strongly to her.

537
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,860
Because I'm pretty.

538
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:13,710
Because I'm so darned pretty.

539
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,400
Tae Ha, your tastes are quite interesting.

540
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,650
Yeon Woo, you said you were adopted. Right?

541
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,980
Have you tried looking for your family?

542
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,180
Adopted? Father, is that true?

543
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,980
But you let them get married?

544
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,050
Mom, why would you say something like that?

545
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,260
Yeah, yeah, I let them get married!

546
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,000
If you're done, let's just eat. Just eat.

547
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,380
I'm thinking of helping her find her family.

548
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,920
No, we'll take care of that.

549
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,770
It's important what Yeon Woo thinks. It's about her, after all.

550
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,710
Where was your adoption agency? Do you have any documents?

551
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,910
You should find your family.

552
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,970
I told you already that we'll handle it.

553
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,580
Oh, my!

554
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,010
I'm sorry! My hands slipped.

555
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,000
Sa Wol...

556
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,750
Sa Wol.

557
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,510
It's you. Right?

558
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,120
Right?

559
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,630
- Sa Wol...
- Lady...

560
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,260
No, someone might see us like this.

561
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,800
What happened? Why are you here?

562
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,550
The thing is...

563
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,790
You should come out for now, Lady.

564
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,380
You also fell in the well?

565
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:25,070
To be more exact, I didn't fall into the well...

566
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,710
Lady? Lady!

567
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,730
Lady!

568
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,500
Lady?

569
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,320
You got sucked into the light?

570
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:58,290
Yes. After entering and exiting the well, I met Machon-daek in some completely strange place.

571
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,510
Hey! Hey!

572
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,360
Oh, my!

573
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,580
In that split second, I instinctively knew.

574
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,330
I had to hold onto this woman.

575
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,360
I kept sticking to her and came all the way here, but it turned out to be the Young Master's house!

576
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:23,720
So I thought I'd be able to meet you somehow if I stayed here, Lady...

577
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,950
But I didn't know I'd really meet you...

578
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,290
Lady?

579
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,380
I was really...

580
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,460
so scared by myself.

581
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,820
I didn't know anyone... Seriously.

582
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,420
It's okay. It's okay.

583
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,570
Now you have me, Sa Wol.

584
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,030
Okay.

585
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,700
All right. Now, all we need to do is return to Joseon. Right?

586
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,790
That's true, but I don't know how.

587
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,220
I don't know how to go back.

588
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,710
Pardon?

589
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,880
I'll see you again in the backyard later.

590
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,930
Meet again in the backyard later. Got it.

591
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:18,910
Mourning Clothes, what are you doing here? Grandpa is looking for you.

592
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,380
- Gosh, you scared me!
- This is different from what you promised, Kim Ha Young.

593
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,920
Damn it...

594
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,470
Who are you? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to me?

595
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,050
Hey! Hey!

596
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,790
Damn it, this is driving me nuts. Where are we going right now?

597
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,700
Gosh, seriously.

598
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,520
Since Tae Ha's great-grandfather's days, they held an antique gallery.

599
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,560
That is how our company got started.

600
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,720
What is inside this?

601
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,660
Oh, that.

602
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:40,660
This contains what I treasure the most.

603
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,160
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes.

604
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,660
Okay.

605
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,380
Father, you should eat dessert.

606
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,160
Oh, right. I see. Shall we see this next time?

607
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,460
- Okay.
- Yeah.

608
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,340
Okay, let's go out.

609
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeon Woo, will you help me out?

610
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,080
All right.

611
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,580
You should have been more careful.

612
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,600
You almost got hurt.

613
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,670
So?

614
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,530
Will you do all your duties as his wife today, too?

615
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,930
Come out soon. You should have tea with us at least.

616
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,670
I will do everything I can.

617
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,280
Since he is my husband.

618
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:17,560
Gosh, what was that? Geez...

619
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,020
Gosh, what the...

620
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,880
You should stop talking now.

621
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,820
I didn't even speak that much! I would think this much is not so bad.

622
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,910
What are you two whispering about and having so much fun?

623
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:40,330
Tae Ha wasn't eating enough, so I was going to feed him this.

624
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,400
Oh, I see.

625
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,470
Tae Ha, say ah!

626
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,400
Eat it!

627
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:59,000
Sister-in-law, I want to give you a wedding gift.

628
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,540
How about shoes? Would money be better?

629
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,870
You were carrying around a money bag last time.

630
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,420
This troublemaker, seriously!

631
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:10,970
M-Money bag?

632
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,560
I mean, everyone likes money.

633
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,920
But still...

634
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,160
that's okay, Young Master.
 (Title you call your husband's younger brother)

635
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,970
All right, okay, then.

636
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,780
Let's eat, eat up.

637
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,720
Deputy CEO, we lost Kim Ha Young.

638
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,510
She should be almost there by now!

639
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,380
Grandfather, I need to step out for a moment.

640
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,740
Okay.

641
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,160
Oh, my. Who's that woman?

642
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:12,000
Father, I've prepared this gift especially for you.

643
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,530
Let me introduce her. She is Tae Ha's—

644
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,290
Grandpa!

645
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,800
This is my girlfriend. She's pretty. Right?

646
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,360
You should say hello.

647
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,530
If you want to live.

648
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,790
Hello. My name is Kim Ha Young.

649
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,580
She's your girlfriend?

650
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,450
He keeps shocking me.

651
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,750
You're not getting married, too. Are you, Tae Min?

652
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,620
- Should I?
- Oh, gosh.

653
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,610
Goodness, please come here. Come here and take a seat.

654
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,890
Please come here and take a seat.

655
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,550
What's with you? What are you doing right now?

656
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:05,050
I'm sure I told you already not to hurt me since I don't know who I'll side with yet.

657
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,220
Kang Tae Min!

658
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,000
Gosh, your voice is too loud, Mom!

659
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,980
What if someone hears you?

660
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,410
Such a shallow strategy won't do.

661
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:18,770
You yourself said Kang Tae Ha is no pushover, CEO Min.

662
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,650
You should be more creative from now on.

663
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,020
Is it your turn now?

664
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,880
What happened with that woman earlier?

665
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,230
She's my girlfriend, but I think I'll break up with her soon.

666
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,880
I've had enough of her.

667
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,530
What's the reason you're doing this?

668
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,760
What are you thinking?

669
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,020
If you're curious, then guess what it is.

670
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,610
I'll be coming to work, too.

671
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,730
Since I'm bored, should I steal everything from you?

672
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,820
I've prepared a place for you to stay and everything you'll need.

673
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,200
[Korean Passport]

674
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:34,550
Okay.

675
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,250
Thank you for helping me.

676
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,790
No problem. I only got hit a few times.

677
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,550
Then, I will call you.

678
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,990
Okay.

679
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,410
[Su (Life)]

680
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,400
This is so...

681
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,060
Happy birthday, Grandfather.

682
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,870
Please live a long and healthy life.

683
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:12,080
This handiwork is masterful.

684
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,850
And the turtle here is a symbol of a long life, isn't it?

685
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:18,960
I love it. Thank you.

686
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,720
How could you be so kind and thoughtful as well?

687
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,430
Oh, no. You and Tae Ha are precious to me, Grandfather.

688
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,710
I see. Goodness, if so, that's good.

689
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,330
With that said, I want your permission for something, Grandfather.

690
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:46,340
Since it's my first time coming to my in-laws house, can we sleep over?

691
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,270
Yes, yes.

692
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,830
You can sleep over as much as you want.

693
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,780
Gosh, so pretty. Really.

694
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,630
W-What is all this?

695
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:05,360
What do you think? It's Grandfather's work.

696
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,190
Why would he prepare such a thing...

697
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,670
Since we are a married couple right now.

698
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,940
A married couple usually stay in the same room.

699
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,600
Well, since we are a married couple, we should...

700
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,090
Consummate? Are you saying we should consummate?

701
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,820
Quiet down! People might hear you outside.

702
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,310
Hurry up and get out!

703
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,250
How could you say that?

704
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,620
This is my grandfather's house!

705
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,960
Things are complicated enough as is. Why would you cause this?

706
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,890
I was just...

707
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:43,060
playing the part of the granddaughter-in-law.

708
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,720
I'm sorry.

709
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,780
What are you doing?

710
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,310
Hello?

711
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,750
The pajamas, the pajamas.

712
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,380
Pajamas...

713
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,650
I'll go and wash up first, so take it easy.

714
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,160
Sure...

715
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,640
Wash up? Why? Where?

716
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,210
Gosh, I must be crazy.

717
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,180
[Secretary Hong]

718
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,850
Kim Ha Young is leaving on a flight tonight.

719
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,290
Keep checking up on her after she arrives in the US.

720
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,750
Okay.

721
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,140
Deputy CEO.

722
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,000
I think you need to see this.

723
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:44,560
Don't be too resentful and pass into Paradise.

724
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,700
He definitely said something.

725
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,480
When is Sa Wol coming?

726
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,150
Cheon Myeong?

727
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,960
Park Yeon Woo.

728
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,080
[Park Yeon Woo]

729
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:15,670
The number you have dialed can not be answered at this time...

730
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,700
Secretary Hong, Park Yeon Woo disappeared.

731
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,510
Again? Did you try calling her?

732
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,440
She's not picking up. I don't know where she went.

733
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,160
Gosh.

734
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,030
I installed a tracking app on Yeon Woo's phone.

735
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,220
I'll be sending you her location for now.

736
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,850
I'll be right there!

737
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:41,600
Okay.

738
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,540
- Park Yeon Woo.
- Yeon Woo!

739
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,530
Park Yeon Woo!

740
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,470
Why did Yeon Woo come all the way here?

741
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,080
Let's just find her first.

742
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,000
Let's see.

743
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,540
[Cannot track the registrant]

744
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,670
What's wrong with this? What the...

745
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,970
[Cannot track the registrant]

746
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,640
I'll go this way. Secretary Hong, you go that way.

747
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,960
Okay.

748
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,030
Park Yeon Woo.

749
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,360
Park Yeon Woo!

750
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,880
Park Jae Won. A civil servant who served as Minister of General Affairs.

751
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,290
His family home was in Hamyang.

752
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,440
My father's family home is in Hamyang,

753
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,950
and his name is Park Jae Won.

754
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,470
He was the Minister of General Affairs.

755
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:57,810
He lived in Hwanghwa-bang, which is currently in the administrative region of the Jeongdong area.

756
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:02,140
This place used to be west of Hanseongbu and was called Hwanghwa-bang.

757
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:05,740
And he had just one daughter,

758
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,670
and her name was...

759
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,050
Park Yeon Woo.

760
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,950
[He had only one daughter, and her name was Park Yeon Woo.]

761
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,780
Where did she go?

762
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,240
Faithful wife...

763
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,160
Who's out there?

764
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,090
Cheon Myeong, is that you?

765
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,910
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

766
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,890
Hello, CEO Lee Mi Dam.

767
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,650
Park Yeon Woo!

768
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:33,590
♫ Even if you are left alone in this place ♫

769
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:41,830
♫ I hope it flows and takes you back to where you left ♫

770
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:50,030
♫ If I set out on the road following those red flowers ♫

771
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:54,120
♫ Will I be able to reach you? ♫

772
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,130
I think I found a way to go back.

773
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:01,850
You're saying you can go back to Joseon once you get what you want. What could that be?

774
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:05,320
It's your first night together with the Young Master.

775
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,520
Gosh, that Sa Wol!

776
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,470
Give it a twist and make a bigger deal out of it.

777
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:11,740
Create rumors!

778
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,410
Our Deputy CEO is married.

779
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:19,070
What will you do, Sister-in- law? I thought I'd become the topic of tabloids first.

780
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:22,030
You know Yeon Woo? Send her back to Italy.

781
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:25,200
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to see you.

782
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,780
You, Park Yeon Woo, from Joseon.
