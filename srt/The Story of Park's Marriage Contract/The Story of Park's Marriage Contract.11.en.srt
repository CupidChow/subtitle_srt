[All characters, places, organizations and institutions that appear in this drama are a work of fiction.]

2
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,810
Why did you do this?

3
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,710
Why!

4
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,990
He killed my wife to save his son.

5
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,340
Just like how he stole your mom from you!

6
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,390
That is your grandfather.

7
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,980
That is Kang Sang Mo!

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,280
That bastard!

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,250
Stop! Stop this now, Grandfather. Please!

10
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,750
If Grandfather did anything wrong,

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,150
I will apologize on his behalf, whatever that may be.

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,870
Hey, hey! W-Why would you kneel?

13
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,800
Why would you apologize to a guy like him?

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,120
Too bad.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,410
I don't think I can forgive him.

16
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,010
No.

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,840
I won't.

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,570
- Because we're going to die together.
- Get up! Get up!

19
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,480
Get up!

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,380
- Get up.
- Grandfather!

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,750
Die!

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,130
Grandfather...

23
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,150
Grandfather!

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,660
Grandfather? Grandfather?

25
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,150
Grandfather, no...

26
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,980
No, Grandfather!

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,790
Grandfather!

28
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,550
You!

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,920
Why did you do that? Why!

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,010
Why!

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,640
Tae Ha, don't do this!

32
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,400
You aren't like this!

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,720
Don't forgive me...

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,650
Both me and that bastard,

35
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,890
don't ever forgive us.

36
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,360
[The night the crepe-myrtle blossoms fade]

37
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,510
If the chairman was admitted to the hospital,

38
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,500
who will lead the group?

39
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,250
It looks like there will be major turmoil.

40
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,560
Come on, being chairman is an honorary position.

41
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,320
A major turmoil would be a bit excessive.

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,950
Is this the start of a war then?

43
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,670
Kang Tae Ha vs. Min Hye Suk, right?

44
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,590
I guess things will go like that.

45
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,460
O-Oh, what I meant was...

46
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,830
Sit down. Sit down.

47
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,470
Are we almost done with the interior installment preparations for Park Yeon Woo's pop-up store?

48
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,080
Yes, we're almost—

49
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,330
We've finished about 71.5%,

50
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,970
and we are planning on doing an overall checkup after the designer interview.

51
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,550
Team Leader Oh,

52
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,390
you can relax.

53
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,040
Just make sure no problems arise with the schedule.

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,770
Okay, I understand.

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,620
What's up with him?

56
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,330
And how are things going with the winter season promotion?

57
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,020
We are planning on meeting with rising designers

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,820
and are in the middle of promotion preparations with the PR team.

59
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,110
I will report the schedule to you as soon as it comes out.

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,650
Kang Tae Ha.

61
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,710
If you're going through a hard time, just show it.

62
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,140
You're no longer Kang Dro anymore.

63
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,280
I guess Tae Min is worried about you.

64
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,520
Of course, brothers will be brothers.

65
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,470
I can't drink coffee.

66
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,730
He was messing with you, I see.

67
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,980
Drink this while you work.

68
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,900
How is the chairman?

69
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,170
He hasn't woken up yet.

70
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,920
Both you and Deputy CEO Kang

71
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,320
will gain as much as you've struggled, Yeon Woo.

72
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,650
It's probably the law of nature

73
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,070
to lose something when you gain something. Right?

74
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,320
Do you have some other concerns?

75
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,330
No.

76
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,910
[Tae Ha]

77
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,220
Excuse me for a moment.

78
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,590
Yes, Tae Ha.

79
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,990
Really?

80
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,750
I couldn't call you up because I couldn't bring myself to.

81
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,450
It appears there's an issue with Father's head.

82
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,750
He's got something called euphoria,

83
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,970
and he feels so happy all the time.

84
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,760
Even though he's lost his children and his beloved company.

85
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,660
- Goodness, it's so nice.
- He just keeps smiling like that.

86
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,910
Hey, look, Mister.

87
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,910
I did a lot of bad things to my son.

88
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,320
Do you think I can be forgiven?

89
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,810
Why? Do you feel bad for your son?

90
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,680
Of course, I feel bad.

91
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,020
But I don't think I can.

92
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,580
I'll never be forgiven.

93
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,160
Since he is no longer in this world.

94
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,610
I guess it's for the best. He doesn't have to see me like this.

95
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,870
Let me give you a riddle. Guess what the answer is.

96
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,440
What is something everyone wants to obtain

97
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,680
but is so difficult to get?

98
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,850
Well, let's see. I don't know.

99
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,000
It's happiness. Happiness.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,600
I tried so hard to obtain that, too, but it's so hard.

101
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,260
So, Mister, make sure you are happy. Okay?

102
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,080
I will pray for that like this. Okay?

103
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,330
Goodness, the weather is so nice.

104
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,040
That day,

105
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,650
why did you come to see Grandfather?

106
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,820
I was worried that you might continue to hurt, Tae Ha.

107
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Since it's painful to live without forgiving someone.

108
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,830
I hoped Grandfather would alleviate a bit of that pain.

109
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,890
I'm thinking of... stop my hate for Grandfather now.

110
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,580
Though his ways were wrong,

111
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,530
I know that he loved me.

112
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,230
Great choice.

113
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,960
I hope you will let go of all your hatred and resentment,

114
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,040
and finally, be at ease.

115
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,010
Don't worry about that since you are by my side.

116
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,160
If you stay here, Lady,

117
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
Kang Tae Ha's heart will stop.

118
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,910
Do you like me that much?

119
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,740
Gosh, even ten of me won't be enough.

120
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,350
First, you should get in line.

121
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,910
I happen to be very popular.

122
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,420
Forget about ten of you.

123
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,470
I just need you, Yeon Woo.

124
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,940
I know...

125
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,620
that I only have a few days left.

126
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,730
I should...

127
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,430
tell Tae Ha, huh?

128
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,960
Kang Tae Min, Kang Tae Min, Kang Tae Min! Get up, get up, get up!

129
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,600
Gosh! What the... What is it?

130
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,700
I'm going to see Father today, so play with my Joon. Okay?

131
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,530
Joon, listen to Brother, eat well, and have a blast together. Okay?

132
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,480
Okay!

133
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,550
I'm going.

134
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,290
Geez, get up!

135
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,970
Damn it...

136
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,080
Hey, Joon.

137
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,500
Why are you here?

138
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,380
What is all this?

139
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,000
What do you think? Let's have some quality time together as brothers.

140
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,270
Forget it! Why should I play with you guys—

141
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,020
Stop it.

142
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,750
Then we'll just leave...

143
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,450
Wait, that's not what I meant, Seo Joon.

144
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,030
- The thing is, I—
- Good job.

145
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,560
You're going to make the kid cry.

146
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,770
How do you play this? Is it fun?

147
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,880
Yes! I'll teach you.

148
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,400
Still, you'll probably lose to me.

149
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,180
We'll have to play to see about that. Isn't that right, Seo Joon?

150
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,950
Brother Tae Min is really good at this.

151
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,000
It's pretty clear you will lose, Brother Tae Ha.

152
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,690
What did you say?

153
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,550
As expected of our Joon! You're just so smart!

154
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,650
Whatever. Let's just get started.

155
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,650
All right. But do you even know how to play this?

156
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,090
Yeah. I know.

157
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,640
This is a memory game. You need to use your brains.

158
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,270
My brain is better than yours.

159
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,150
All right, I'll explain how to play. Pay attention.

160
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,420
I must be crazy.

161
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,090
It's prettier than the flower rings and jade rings I received in Joseon. What do I do?

162
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,650
What do I do!

163
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,530
What do I do? What do I do?

164
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,260
What do I do?

165
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,240
What do I do!

166
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,450
What the...

167
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,620
Gosh, no, no, no!

168
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,570
Gosh, no!

169
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,030
What is it? What's wrong?

170
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,840
Well...

171
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,070
Seong Pyo... proposed... ring...

172
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,280
I... lost it...

173
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,380
You lost the ring that Brother proposed to you with?

174
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,850
Yeah...

175
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,790
Gosh... Gosh, this can't be!

176
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,660
What is all this?

177
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,160
This isn't it.

178
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,910
Well...

179
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,730
This is not how it feels.

180
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,320
Gosh, Brother! Why did you...

181
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,760
have to propose with a can tab

182
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,860
and make people suffer like this?

363
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,150
W-What's wrong with you? Is something wrong?

364
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,030
It's okay if I am unable to walk.

365
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,020
It's fine even if I spend the rest of my life lying in bed! Just...

366
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,460
I just need to be breathing, so...

367
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,400
just fix my heart, please.

368
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,650
Senior, please. Please?

369
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,510
Save me.

370
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,770
Senior, what do I need to do?

371
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,860
I'll do whatever it is!

372
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,510
Just fix this, please!

373
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:14,610
♫ I can't help but look at you ♫

374
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:21,100
♫ Our days are deeply engraved ♫

375
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:29,390
♫ I always go to sleep thinking that I want to see you one more time ♫

376
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:36,910
​♫ Even if only in my dreams ♫

377
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:43,870
♫ I'll think I'm dreaming for a moment ♫

378
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:49,650
♫ Even if a day passes without you  ♫

379
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:58,290
♫ I'll hold on to the moments we had together ♫

380
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,310
[Yeon Woo]

381
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,010
I think that's Ms. Yeon Woo. Aren't you going to pick it up?

382
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:26,280
Please tell Team Leader Oh to resubmit her proposal for the pop-up store promotions.

383
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,870
It's a mess.

384
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,540
Oh, okay.

385
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,810
Let's have dinner together tonight.

386
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,940
I'll wait for you.

387
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,030
What do you mean by that?

388
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,680
You will go back to Joseon?

389
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,960
We were going to go back from the start.

390
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,590
But why all of a sudden?

391
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,960
But how do we go back?

392
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,030
Did you find a way to return?

393
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,460
Cheonmyeong told me.

394
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,850
Then, what about Young Master?

395
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,100
Did you tell him?

396
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,150
What did he say? He said not to go, right? Right?

397
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,990
I'm going to tell him again today.

398
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,610
That's why I'm trying to learn how to make tteokbokki.

399
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,940
So I can talk to him again while eating it.

400
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,910
How could you eat tteokbokki in this situation?

401
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,700
I think the carrots are done.

402
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,840
Then...

403
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,170
Then...

404
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,290
I guess I'll go with you...

405
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,100
What? What did you say?

406
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,760
Never mind. Just soak some rice cakes in the water.

407
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,570
Rice cakes. Okay.

408
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,280
You need to put the rice cakes in the water first.

409
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,010
April.

410
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,050
Why are you sitting like that?

411
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,720
What's going on? What's wrong?

412
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,480
Did you fight with Na Rae?

413
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,380
Lady says she is returning to Joseon.

414
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,550
What did you say! Ms. Yeon Woo is returning to Joseon?

415
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,560
What about you, Sa Wol?

416
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,920
If Lady returns, then I'll probably go with her.

417
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,870
Where do you think you're going?

418
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,040
You will leave me?

419
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,380
That's what I'm saying!

420
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,210
No! You can't! Don't go!

421
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,050
No!

422
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,310
Don't leave!

423
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,810
I'm sorry for everything!

424
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,000
What do I do...

425
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,820
Are you home?

426
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,020
Wash up and join me. I made something tasty.

427
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,170
I don't feel like eating. You go ahead.

428
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,140
You should eat, though.

429
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,070
I said, I'm fine.

430
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,490
If you'll keep avoiding me, why did you even come home?

431
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,690
This is my house.

432
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,230
Fine. Then I'll just leave.

433
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,980
Are you playing with me?

434
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,360
What are you trying to do here? I'm going crazy because of this!

435
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,600
Just eating and chatting like nothing happened... Is that possible for you, Yeon Woo?

436
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,650
Then, should I just cry about it constantly?

437
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,350
No matter how hard, upsetting, and infuriating it is, people must keep living on.

438
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,300
Will you do this too if I stay by your side and die one day?

439
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,890
- Like you've given up on everything?
- Yes, that's right.

440
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,240
Because I love you.

441
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,400
Do I need any other reason?

442
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,270
Then, what about me?

443
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,580
There is a way to save you, yet you want me to do nothing?

444
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,800
Did you think I'd be fine with that?

445
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,170
There are only about two weeks left

446
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,780
before the crepe-myrtle blossom fades.

447
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,680
This time is more precious to me than anything,

448
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,990
so please don't be like this.

449
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,800
♫ I just looked at it again and then blankly drew it again in the night sky ♫

450
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,410
♫ I just looked at it again and then blankly drew it again in the night sky ♫

451
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:26,790
♫ You are trying to come to me again ♫

452
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:33,630
♫ I pretend not to notice and turn around. Even when I turn my head ♫

453
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:39,770
♫ The tears blur like cloudy rainwater ♫

454
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:46,600
♫ I couldn't forget you today, either ♫

455
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,080
Did you have something you wanted to hear from me?

456
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,510
Or did you come to thank me?

457
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,380
You've deceived me quite well for all those years by my side.

458
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,180
You're quite amazing.

459
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,920
No,

460
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,200
perhaps did I use your desire for revenge, Director Hwang?

461
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:31,610
Chairman Kang fell into the hell he created for himself,

462
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,430
so you should relinquish your feelings now.

463
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:41,330
And about your wife and child, Director Hwang,

464
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,920
I am truly sorry.

465
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,990
I, too, will take responsibility for what I should,

466
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,180
so don't worry.

467
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,080
Take care of your health.

468
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,390
Don't do that.

469
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,610
You have a son, CEO.

470
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,200
You should at least protect one.

471
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,360
Although I wasn't able to do so.

472
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:34,390
Yeon Woo returned her mother's book a few days ago and left.

473
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,640
Did she also say that she will return to Joseon?

474
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,220
Yes.

475
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,310
She was very upset that the contents of the book didn't change,

476
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:47,220
saying that she was still Loyal Wife Park,

477
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,610
and that she wasn't able to protect you in the past and in the present, Tae Ha.

478
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,320
As far as I know, Yeon Woo will do anything for you.

479
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,170
You know that, right?

480
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,340
Yes, Yeon Woo is stubborn.

481
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:10,980
I hope that what I say helps you find your answer, Deputy CEO Kang.

482
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,640
What brings you here at this hour?

483
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,910
Let's go to the police station together tomorrow.

484
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,140
Even if you're going in as a witness, it will be scary.

485
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,400
Forget it. I have an attorney anyway.

486
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,800
You know that I really don't listen. Right?

487
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,690
I'll see you tomorrow.

488
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,550
Sleep well.

489
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,400
It was because of you.

490
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,700
You had asked me... why I gave birth to you.

491
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,000
After he died, I thought about following him in death,

492
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,170
but I couldn't.

493
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,520
Because you were in my womb.

494
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,160
That's all an excuse,

495
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,070
since I'm not qualified to be a mother.

496
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,440
At least you know.

497
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,410
Then, start acting like one now.

498
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,210
When I first saw you here, I thought you were a crazy person.

499
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,630
I would have thought the same.

500
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,680
I started calling you "Husband" out of nowhere.

501
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,310
But...

502
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,650
I feel like I'm the crazy one now.

503
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,740
I am... going to let you go, Yeon Woo.

504
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,040
I lost.

505
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,890
Your time, Yeon Woo...

506
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,580
I'll return it to you.

507
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,750
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,670
It's okay.

509
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,660
Since I'm going to make you pay a high price for it.

510
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,870
As much as you want.

511
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,550
How long did you say you have until the crepe-myrtle blossoms fade?

512
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:31,670
Now... there are only two weeks left.

513
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,510
That's more than enough time...

514
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,720
for me to love you, Yeon Woo.

515
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,350
The time for us to love each other.

516
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,100
We have something to say to you two,

517
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,890
and Yeon Woo wanted to make something tasty for you.

518
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,390
Something to say? That we have to go back to Joseon?

519
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,970
No. Anything but that.

520
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,410
But the only thing Tae Ha and I knew how to make was tteokbokki.

521
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,560
Sorry.

522
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,760
It's okay. The plate looks fancy

523
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,450
so it looks even tastier...

524
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,660
Thank you for the food.

525
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,490
Our final goodbye will be spicy. Right?

526
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:45,840
April, I've made up my mind to become Loyal Husband Hong.

527
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,670
I can tell what you guys are saying to each other!

528
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,060
Stop overreacting and start eating!

529
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,570
[Birth certificate]

530
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:04,940
This is a document to make your ID, Sa Wol.

531
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,600
Pardon?

532
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,480
I asked him for it.

533
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,710
You'll need an ID if you are going to live here.

534
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,690
My L-Lady...

535
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,950
W-Wait, then Sa Wol isn't going back to Joseon?

536
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,580
Why would Sa Wol go back?

537
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,430
You're here, Mr. Hong.

538
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,930
But you're going back even though the CEO is here, Ms. Yeon Woo—

539
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,730
No, I want to go with you.

540
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,400
It's pretty obvious that you don't mean that.

541
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,920
Half of me means it...

542
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,130
My Lady...

543
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,010
Thank you.

544
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,140
Thank you.

545
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,200
- W-What's wrong with you!
- I love you, CEO!

546
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,580
W-What do you mean you love me?

547
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Gosh, stop touching me!

548
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,260
I used to live in this alley when I was young.

549
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,560
With my parents, I would buy books and go on walks like this.

550
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,790
I really wanted to show you, Yeon Woo.

551
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,530
Thank you for bringing me here.

552
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,110
Aren't you thirsty? Do you want to drink something?

553
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,860
It so happens that I'm hungry.

554
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,120
I should have waited a bit before asking.

555
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,530
That way, your stomach would have made that growling noise.

556
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,440
It's really fun making fun of you about it.

557
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,850
Isn't it also pretty fun to get punched?

558
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,480
So the thing is, there used to be a cafe here...

559
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,840
Trickster Guy, wait for me.

560
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:55,310
As always, Choco is the tastiest!

561
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,120
Eat slowly. You're going to spill everything like that.

562
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,940
What am I, a child?

563
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,480
As if I will spill everything while I eat.

564
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,340
Why are you staring at me like that?

565
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,550
You're definitely not a child.

566
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,310
It tastes like an adult's cream.

567
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,870
How is it?

568
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,600
Gosh, seriously!

569
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,570
Should we go here?

570
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,610
Sounds good.

576
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:13,180
And this looks like Mr. Hong when he is spacing out.

You like it? Do you want to buy one of each?

578
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,220
They will like it if we give them as gifts.

579
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,310
They are probably upset because we came by ourselves.

580
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,530
Please give me everything.

581
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,580
- Pardon?
- Everything.

582
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,560
Okay.

583

- What is this?
- What do you think?

586
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,580
It's a guidebook for your birth registration since you have no documents.

587
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,820
No documents?

588
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,500
This book contains why you were unable to submit your birth registration until now,

589
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,480
and why you are unable to remember your parents.

590
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,040
This perfect tear-jerking story is all in here.

591
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,360
Who made this?

592
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,050
The king of stories, Hong Seong Pyo.

593
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:13,940
So, you're telling me to read this long book and memorize it?

594
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,240
Of course.

595
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,010
By the way, there is no Ma Dang Swe or Dol Swe in it.

596
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,010
Don't look for them.

597
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,560
Okay.

Gosh, I suddenly need to use the bathroom. Gosh...

00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,540
You may have entered as you pleased, Sa Wol,

600
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,620
but leaving is a different story.

601
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,710
Sa Wol doesn't like studying...

602
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,800
It's painful.

603
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,100
No, you can't.

607
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,140
and grateful.

Thank you as well...

I'm glad... that I won't be leaving you here alone.

You have your good memories and people to be with you.

Why am I not with you?

I'll continue to remain in your heart.

615
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,110
Continuously?

616
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,800
I don't want that. If I meet someone nice, I'll date her.

617
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,000
That sounds good, too.

618
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,650
If that will make you less lonely.

619
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,140
I'm scared because it feels like I can grasp the moon.

620
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,870
You're scared?

621
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:34,280
Since my heart will break if I want what I can't have.

622
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,630
Just make a wish.

623
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,740
And ask to have it forever.

624
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,930
You said if you meet someone nice, you'd date her.

625
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,780
You said it's fine if I date another girl.

626
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,100
You asked me to be yours. You're such a trickster.

627
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,490
Can I really do that?

628
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:58,930
No, you can't.

629
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,100
You should just be mine.

630
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,690

Hello. I am Yeonwoo's designer, Park Yeon Woo.

645
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:33,560
Yeonwoo was taken from my name. Yeon, which means to connect, and Woo, which means to meet.

646
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:40,230
Just like that meaning, I want to cherish the connections I made with people I met through my clothes.

647
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:44,060
Goodness. Yeon Woo looks so pretty on screen!

How's it going? Is she doing well?

651
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,440
Yeon Woo doesn't just make clothes well, but she's also great at interviews.

652
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,720
She never loses an argument. Not a single word.

653
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,430
It was a unique opportunity to work with good people and make diverse clothing,

654
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,570
so I think of it as a meaningful project in my life.

655
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,460
Do you have any final things you would like to say?

656
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:19,430
I would like my name, Park Yeon Woo, and my clothes to be remembered for a long time.

712
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,740
Until then, will you forget me?

713
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,950
If you do so, Yeon Woo,

714
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,610
I will do the same.

715
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,610
You know that won't happen.

716
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,070
That's a relief.

717
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,950
Thank you.

718
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,810
I love you.

719
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,750
♫ The moment we ran into each other by chance ♫

720
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:37,630
♫ I remember you shining like a wave ♫

721
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:47,150
♫ As if I already knew, as if I had been waiting for it ♫

722
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:51,790
♫ My heart was racing ♫

723
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:59,030
♫ By coincidence, I am here now ♫

724
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:06,660
♫ Like fate, I look at you again ♫

725
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:17,710
♫ You bloom like a dream inside of me ♫

726
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:24,280
​♫ You are the one I finally get to meet after crossing a long, long time ♫

727
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:33,030
♫ Like a dream, I will always protect you like now ♫

728
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:42,450
♫ Even if I go back, I won't lose you again ♫

729
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:48,810
Before I came here, my time stood still.

730
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:57,060
After meeting you, while loving you and suffering,

731
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,820
I lived as the person I dreamed of being.

732
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,340
That is enough for me.

733
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:12,260
It is enough for me to have a good memory to remember you by.

734
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:18,140
I was happy that I could be with you.

735
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,910
The sun is already up in the middle of the sky. Are you still sleeping?

736
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,210
What is wrong?

737
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:26,220
Are you feeling sick?

738
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,860
Yeon Woo.

739
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,380
Where are you hurting?

740
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,140
No.

741
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,110
It is just that you were here when I woke up.

742
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,250
Goodness.

743
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:48,160
Did you not say you hated me for forcing you to marry?

744
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,500
- Marry?
- That is right.

745
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,620
Your wedding day is in ten days.

746
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,400
I should tell Machon-daek to bring in the breakfast.

747
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,860
Brush your hair and wash your face first.

748
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,520
M-Mother.

749
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,420
What about Sa Wol?

750
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,360
Sa Wol?

751
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,340
Who is that?

752
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:13,740
What dream did you dream that you are speaking nonsense in the morning?

753
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,750
Come to your senses and get up.

754
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,010
Only I came back, I see.

755
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,890
That's a relief.

756
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:13,300
Please come out quietly to the riverside bridge at the hour of dog.
(Around 8 p.m.)

757
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,500
I have something I must tell you.

758
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,770
Maiden Yeon Woo.

759
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,410
What do you mean my life is at risk?

760
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:21,850
I will ask you one thing.

761
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:25,800
Does your mother give you an herbal decoction daily, Young Master?

762
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,960
That is so.

763
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,980
But how do you know that...

764
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,500
Though it may not be my place to say,

765
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,080
but there is poison in your herbal decoction.

766
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,880
Poison?

767
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,470
Maiden, you should watch your words.

768
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,510
You do not have to believe me.

769
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,820
You can report me to the authorities.

770
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:47,320
However, do not just ignore what I say.

771
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:52,620
Check with this silver hairpin.

772
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,080
And please make sure to eat the antidote as well.

773
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:03,550
I really want to save you, Young Master.

774
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,350
Where have you been?

775
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:18,020
I have been waiting for you here for a long time.

776
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:23,270
I went out to get some air and lost track of time.

777
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:28,770
I brought you some herbal decoction, so drink it and rest.

778
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:34,820
You are taking your medicine well. Right?

779
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:39,140
Yes, Mother. You need not worry.

780
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,940
Yes, all right.

781
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:58,070
There is poison in your herbal decoction.

782
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,780
Check with this silver hairpin.

783
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,730
Wow, the top old maiden in Hanyang is finally getting married!

784
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:23,260
She is pretty. She is prettier than I thought.

785
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:26,660
Aigoo, she is pretty, but she is old. Right?

786
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:57,030
Young Master, did you take the medicine that I gave you?

787
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:02,430
First, I want to ask you something.

788
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,420
Why are you marrying me?

789
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:09,260
If it is as you say, Maiden,

790
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:12,360
you could have rejected it.

791
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:16,070
I cannot tell you right now.

792
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:19,240
Is there something else I should know about?

793
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:34,330
Young Master! Young Master!

794
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:39,270
Young Master, did you not take the medicine?

795
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:43,310
No! No, Young Master!

796
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:47,510
Someone! Is anyone out there?

797
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,640
Do not worry...

798
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,880
Do not worry and...

799
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:04,810
Young Master, no...

800
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,140
You must not die like this...

801
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,490
How did this happen again...

802
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,240
Why...

803
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,400
Young Master...

[The Story of Park's Marriage Contract]

808
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,450
This arrow will pierce your heart!

809
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,510
You should prepare yourself for the worst.

810
01:08:56,510 --> 01:09:00,240
If we cannot be a married couple, how about being friends?

811
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,970
Yeon Woo, you must've really forgotten all about me.

812
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:09,970
I want to go to you, but I don't know how.

813
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:11,910
Must I forget about everything like this?

814
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:15,070
I'm sure she's doing well as expected of Yeon Woo.

815
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,860
She promised me that she'd come back.

816
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:20,380
If I'm to die anyway, I'll die right here.

817
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:24,690
If there is a next life, will you come to meet me again?

818
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:28,840
Especially if it is fate.
