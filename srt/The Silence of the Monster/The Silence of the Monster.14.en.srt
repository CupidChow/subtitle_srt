5
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,890
You met your friend today?

6
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,870
The one you post on your Moments?

7
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,050
If they ask who I am,

8
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,259
remember,

9
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,840
don't answer directly.

10
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,690
The more mysterious, the better.

11
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,980
How long have you known each other?

12
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,009
A long time.

13
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,200
It tastes awful.

14
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,480
I'm full.

15
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,750
Enjoy yourselves.

16
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,500
If you have a chance to spend time with him alone,

17
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,990
find the right time

18
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,510
to gaze at him sincerely.

19
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,650
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,310
When you talk to a girl,

21
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,630
you should

22
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,250
tenderly look her in the eyes

23
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,290
and tell her

24
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,870
your true and wonderful thoughts.

25
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,240
At that moment,

26
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,620
she will definitely feel your tenderness.

27
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,700
Girls like gentlemen.

28
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,930
I was wrong yesterday.

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,579
I shouldn't have talked so harshly to Big Force.

30
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,770
I shouldn't have

31
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,829
let off steam on you.

32
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,620
Please don't mind.

33
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,170
It's okay.

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,840
I did something wrong too.

35
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,180
Then push something closer to you

36
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,780
towards her.

37
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,829
Hint at your relationship

38
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,310
with the symbol of that object.

39
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,220
Do you want to add vinegar?

40
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,170
Okay.

41
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,360
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

42
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,260
Pork rib soup.

43
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,560
Okay, got it.

44
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,200
I like sour food.

45
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,620
Young man.

46
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,140
Sui,

47
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,510
did you receive the commission?

48
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,340
How much is it?

49
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,010
What's the percentage?

50
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,810
I can't tell you that.

51
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,470
Why not?

52
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,740
Let me tell you how much I took.

53
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,760
Mr. Zhou.

54
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,090
What are you doing?

55
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,900
I asked you to search previous cases

56
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,600
and sort out laws.

57
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,380
Why haven't you sent it to me?

58
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,690
Sorry, Mr. Zhou.

59
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,070
I left it in my mailbox and forgot to send it.

60
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,140
I'll send it to you now.

61
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,460
Since 8 o'clock today,

62
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,220
many protesters have surrounded

63
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,860
the headquarters of Caixin Pay in the Innovation Industrial Park.

64
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,850
These protesters claimed to be cheated by Caixin Pay.

65
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,270
They lost hundreds of thousands to millions.

66
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,740
Three months ago,

67
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,020
Caixin Pay had

68
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,360
default problems.

69
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,020
Now it has the same problem.

70
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,190
The office is empty.

71
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,700
Anyone of the management can't be contacted.

72
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,180
It's suspected to be a complete default.

73
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,740
The police filed a case for investigation

74
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,980
after receiving the call.

75
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,290
The Caixin Pay headquarters was immediately sealed.

76
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,690
The total amount is up to 4 billion yuan.

77
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,660
It's quite a loss.

78
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,860
Luckily, I didn't have the money to invest in it.

79
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,510
Mr. Zheng.

80
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,340
Hello, Chufeng.

81
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,470
This one.

82
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,010
It was sent here early in the morning.

83
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,510
Mr. Zheng.

84
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,240
I've checked it.

85
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,920
There's no problem.

86
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,760
The initial password is in the manual.

87
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,670
You can follow instructions step by step.

88
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,300
You ordered this for me.

89
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,180
Of course I trust you.

90
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,890
Although it's the best price

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,980
within the price range,

92
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,350
I still need to confirm with you.

93
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,460
You bought a fire-proof safe,

94
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,970
not a security safe.

95
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,210
There's nothing valuable in my shabby bookstore.

96
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,220
Just some limited edition books.

97
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,380
There was a bookstore on fire

98
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,660
in Yuzhong District.

99
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,740
It was burnt down.

100
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,510
So I planned

101
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,920
to buy a fire-proof safe.

102
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,950
Okay, I'm gonna go.

103
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,660
Okay.

104
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,280
I'll ask you if there's any doubt.

105
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,640
Okay.

106
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,230
I forgot my receipt.

107
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,850
Here it is.

108
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,240
Did you find it?

109
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,100
Yes.

110
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,720
Isn't it here?

111
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,130
Are you looking for me?

112
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,490
Did I disturb you?

113
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,050
No.

114
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,710
I want to tell you something in person.

115
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,580
Today is the pay day.

116
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,180
Just now.

117
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,220
Sorry for

118
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,680
taking so long.

119
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,120
It's okay.

120
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,610
I'll go upstairs if there's nothing else.

121
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,740
Well,

122
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,930
are you going to see your friend this weekend?

123
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,200
Are you talking about Zheng Xinchuan?

124
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,430
That's his name?

125
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,350
I'm not sure.

126
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,850
He…

127
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,050
He was my senior

128
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,300
when we learned martial arts from my grandpa when we were young.

129
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,930
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

130
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,320
He came here on a business trip,

131
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,350
so we met.

132
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,240
I see.

133
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,530
It just came to me

134
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,440
I'm going to buy some decorations

135
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,310
and plants

136
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,100
for Christmas and the New Year.

137
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,020
Will you be available then?

138
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,780
Do you want to come along?

139
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,740
I was just asking.

140
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,350
I can go alone.

141
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,640
I'm gonna go back to my room.

142
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,760
Let's go together.

143
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,340
Okay.

144
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,840
[Warm Winter In December]

145
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,110
Is it too grand?

146
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,320
Is it too bright?

147
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,490
It's too formal.

148
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,130
Why is making an outfit harder than the law exam?

149
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,090
Morning.

150
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:00,810
Morning.

151
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,140
Why are you dressed like this?

152
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,260
Why? Does it look bad?

153
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,580
Tell me where you're going.

154
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,420
We're going to buy some

155
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,930
decorations for Christmas.

156
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,780
Do you want to come along?

157
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,960
You?

158
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,980
Go. Get changed.

159
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,710
No.

160
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,100
You may not know my style.

161
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,460
But I know He Chufeng's style.

162
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,390
Hurry up.

163
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,070
Are you done?

164
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,730
Yes.

165
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,220
We're going to buy some decorations.

166
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,390
You wanna come along?

167
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:26,970
No.

168
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,230
We have customers today.

169
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,370
I have to stay in the shop.

170
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,150
Let's go.

171

Sui Yi.

172
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:41,990
Bring your clothes.

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,970
What is he thinking?

174
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,970
Of course there could only be two people on a date.

175
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,010
How could there be three people?

176
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,640
Is his head a safe?

177
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,000
I really want to break it.

178
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,610
Like this?

179
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,860
But Sui Yi

180
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,340
may get a key to his head soon.

181
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,970
Will they come back straight away

182
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,670
after shopping?

183
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,150
Probably not.

184
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,190
They should know

185
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,990
the steps of a date.

186
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,340
Should we

187
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,600
go to the decoration market?

188
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,620
Robin said

189
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,020
he wanted to buy a big gift box.

190
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,380
No hurry.

191
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,190
We can have lunch first.

192
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,290
Aren't we going to have lunch with Robin?

193
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,030
We're finally out.

194
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,380
Why do we have to go back

195
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,260
and eat with him?

196
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,830
Okay.

197
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,690
Anything else you want to eat?

198
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,810
You ordered all my favorite dishes.

199
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,110
I'm glad you like them.

200
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,690
Did you come here often?

201
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,210
Sometimes.

202
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,580
I haven't had babecue for a long time.

203
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,780
That's good.

204
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,770
You can eat more today.

205
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,430
I'm bored. I have nothing to do.

206
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,700
Hello,

207
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,690
this is Monster Vintage.

208
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,020
Robin.

209
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,390
Do you want to go shopping with me?

210
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:20,990
No.

211
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,630
Really?

212
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,910
Don't you miss me?

213
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,720
Why would I miss you?

214
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,300
Why can they go on a date

215
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,210
while I'm working here?

216
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,620
That's too much.

217
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,020
Hey!

218
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,870
Robin.

219
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,530
Aren't you going shopping with me?

220
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,540
I need to look after the shop. I really can't.

221
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,080
That's it. Bye.

222
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,170
Do you think I'm going to die alone?

223
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:05,950
Yes.

224
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,750
I don't think I'll die alone.

225
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,530
Thank you.

226
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,250
Let's dig in.

227
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,980
♫The breeze is brushing my weary face♫

♫Hey, it's all right. No more sighing♫

I'm telling you.

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,870
I'm good at grilling.

237
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,180
There was a summer vacation in high school.

♫The Milky Way is endless. Take a deep breath♫

239

My mom insisted on teaching me how to cook.

240
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,210
Maybe I'm not gifted.

00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,100
shut my window for it.

244
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,130
I burnt two pots in two days.

245
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,880
My mom gave up then.

246

♫Why are we so childish?♫

247
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,830
I didn't expect a cooking fool like me

248
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,480
would be quite talented at grilling.

♫I folded the answer in the paper plane♫

250

Every time we went to a barbecue restaurant,

251
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,890
I would be in charge of grilling.

252
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,400
Try it.

253

I don't think he likes it too red.

266
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,860
It'll be dark when we watch a movie later.

You don't know?

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,080

he left you alone

in the cinema?

328
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,460
It's okay to watch a movie alone.

329
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
I used to watch movies alone.

330
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,420
Is the one you bought big enough?

331
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:15,760
Yes.

332
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,070
Why did you buy it?

333
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,860
For decoration?

334
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,110
Do you like He Chufeng?

335
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,230
I'm just curious.

336
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,310
Yes, I do.

337
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,570
If you really like him,

338
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,790
you have to be prepared.

339
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,730
He may be like this anytime.

340
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,340
His job is dangerous.

341
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,950
He often goes on business trips.

342
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,100
And there may be emergencies

343
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
at any time.

344
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,330
He's often called out

345
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,760
24-7.

346
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,380
If you stay with him,

347
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,800
you may need to expect something different

348
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,000
than a normal couple.

349
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,520
You need to be prepared.

350
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,530
I didn't say I wanted to be with him.

351
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,010
A date is a date.

352
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,980
Are you going to say

353
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,410
you two are just friends?

354
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,540
I just often felt that

355
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,220
he had a lot on his mind,

356
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,920
but he never said it.

357
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,770
There are two kinds of people who have experienced pain.

358
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,880
One is to impose their pain

359
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,330
onto others.

360
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,620
And the other

361
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,050
tries to protect others from pain.

362
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,490
He Chufeng is the second type.

363
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,120
If you like him,

364
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,530
you have to understand him.

365
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,360
I have another question.

366
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,390
Go ahead.

367
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,600
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

368
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,690
Don't you have a girl you like?

369
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,460
None of your blind dates worked.

370
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,200
In two days,

371
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,340
I'll bring my Cupid back

372
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,420
and let you know

373
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,680
what real love is.

374
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,180
Sui Yi.

375
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,740
I find that

376
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,320
you're as annoying as He Chufeng now.

377
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,080
Why?

378
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,850
Life can't always

379
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,760
be happy.

380
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,860
He Chufeng used to be the reason for my unhappiness,

381
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,420
and you, Sui Yi, are the additional reason now.

382
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,080
Aren't we good friends?

383
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,660
Don't you like

384
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,070
our life vibe right now?

385
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,800
Okay, I'm gonna go.

386
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,850
Take your time.

387
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,850
Enjoy yourself.

388
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,090
Don't you want your stuff?

389
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,660
Aren't you taking them in yourself?

390
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,840
Can you do it for me?

391
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,780
Why should I help you?

392
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,500
I bought it for you.

393
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,580
Do I have to help you take them in?

394
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,980
Aren't we friends?

395
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,940
We are not now.

396
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:09,970
You're back.

397
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,130
You're still up?

398
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:25,850
There you go.

399
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,510
I'm not as good as you at cooking,

400
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,720
but I'm good at making instant noodles.

401
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,140
Try it.

402
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:39,910
You said

403
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,900
you're good at making delicious instant noodles.

404
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,300
You still remember?

405
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,090
I'm sorry

406
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,090
for not watching the movie with you.

407
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,780
It's okay.

408
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,710
Work is the most important.

409
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,720
If I suddenly had work to do,

410
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,220
I would have left you there too.

411
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,000
Okay.

412
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,510
Next time you leave me alone.

413
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,260
Can't we watch a movie together?

414
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,160
Dig in. The noodles are getting cold.

415
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,370
What's wrong?

416
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:51,980
Are you okay?

417
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm fine.

418
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,940
I'm just a little tired.

419
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,700
Don't eat if you can't eat.

420
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,540
It's okay.

421
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,090
Let me do it.

422
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,490
Are you tired?

423
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,680
I'm fine.

424
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:31,980
Today,

425
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,490
I saw something bad.

426
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,580
I feel a bit sad.

427
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,220
Can you stay with me?

428
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,610
Have you ever been helpless?

429
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,060
They are right in front of you,

430
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,890
but you can't do anything.

431
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,580
You can't do anything.

432
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,550
When I was ten,

433
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,330
I opened the first lock in my life.

434
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,870
This needs the password.

435
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,240
Do you remember the password?

436
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,860
I don't remember.

437
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,560
You're amazing, Brother!

438
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,240
Here you go.

439
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,700
Chufeng.

440
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,900
Come out and clean up the table. Time to eat.

441
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,090
Let's dig in.

442
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,870
Don't always eat meat.

443
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,260
Have some vegetables.

444
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Chufeng.

445
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:35,940
Chufeng.

446
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,560
What are you doing?

447
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,250
He didn't know the password,

448
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,860
but he still opened the lock.

449
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,300
Really?

450
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,950
Yes.

451
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,770
He opened it right away.

452
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,760
It's like magic.

453
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,300
That's quite impressive.

454
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,610
Chufeng.

455
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,090
Can you tell mom

456
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,070
how you opened it?

457
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,930
Actually,

458
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,510
I was not as good as Chunian said at the beginning.

459
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,820
At first,

460
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,320
I tried to decipher the password

461
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,050
by permutation and combination.

462
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,940
It's open.

463
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,090
Mom, look.

464
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,440
My brother is a genius.

465
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,670
Chufeng.

466
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:14,909
You're really amazing.

467
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,449
But,

468
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,900
don't tell dad.

469
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,550
Chufeng.

470
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,610
What are you doing?

471
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,440
One time, I was found

472
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,290
opening a box at home.

473
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,140
My dad beat me up.

474
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,780
He said I opened the lock

475
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,400
to steal things from home.

476
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,120
If he hadn't taught me a lesson,

477
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,240
I would become a thief in the future.

478
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,390
My mom tired to help me,

479
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,400
but she had no choice.

480
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,130
Later, under my mom's cover,

481
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,980
I started to learn secretly how to open locks.

482
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,500
From Chunian's savings pot to the bookcase,

483
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,280
to the lock of my room door,

484
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,170
I opened all of them.

485
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,300
Then I started to

486
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,430
try to unlock the iron door of our home.

487
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,220
I thought I was smart.

488
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,250
After I unlocked it,

489
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,600
I could restore the lock core

490
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,620
without leaving any trace.

491
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,470
Besides, my mom and Chunian

492
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,490
had been keeping the secret for me,

493
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,650
so my dad never found out.

494
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,760
When the metal box

495
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,040
couldn't be opened before

496
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,390
was suddenly opened,

497
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,430
I felt the joy and the sense of accomplishment

498
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,920
that I looked forward to the most when I was young.

499
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,900
But I never thought

500
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,100
these happiest things

501
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,960
would be the beginning of my nightmare.

502
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:03,790
Young man,

503
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,680
do you need a key?

504
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,790
Can I have a look?

505
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,490
Yes.

506
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,000
What kind of key do you want?

507
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,070
Pick one yourself.

508
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,330
Let me help you up.

509
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,670
Take the medicine

510
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,570

Come on.

Chunian is the best.

Here, sit properly.

Let me feed you the medicine.

515
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,180
Be careful.

516
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:33,790
It's hot.

517
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,670
Good girl.

518
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,660
Mom.

519
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Mom!

520
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,580
Mom.

521
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,510
Chunian, don't be afraid.

522
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,910
Mom's here.

523
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,300
Come.

524
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,940
I'm here.

525
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,490
It's okay.

526
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,020
Chufeng.

527
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,390
Brother, save us!

Chufeng.

530
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,090
Brother, help!

531
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,190
The door can't be opened.

532
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,360
Chufeng.

533
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,190
Brother.

534
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,700
The door can't be opened.

535
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,300
-Chufeng. -Brother.

536

-Help us. -Mom. Mom.

537
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,100
Chufeng.

538
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,160
Move aside!

539
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,360
Move aside!

540
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,220

[Monster Notebook]

543
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,600
Chufeng.

544
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,400
How did you open the lock?

545
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,730
Can you tell mom?

546
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,310
Actually,

547
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,970
I was not as good as Chunian said at the beginning.

548
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,340
At first,

549
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,860
I tried to decipher the password

550
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,580
by permutation and combination.

551
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,020
But I saw

552
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,340
there were three password positions.

553
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,110
Each position has 10 numbers

554
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,870
from zero to nine.

555
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,770
So that's ten cubed.

556
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,540
There are 1,000 possibilities in total.

557
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,220
If I try them one by one,

558
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,060
it'll be a waste of time.

559
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,660
But

560
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,430
this is Chunian's savings pot.

561
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,420
So I guessed the password

562
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,570
Chunian would set.

563
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,610
I tried and opened it.

564
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,980
The password is mom's birthday.

565
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,770
Chufeng

566
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,020
is amazing.

567
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,330
The math teacher praised you before.

568
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,290
You solved many math problems

569
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,710
those middle high students couldn't even solve.

570
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,050
Isn't your brother amazing?

571
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,180
He even guessed Chunian's thoughts.

572
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:03,730
Yes.

573
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,330
What are you looking for?

574
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,670
You...

575
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,190
Stand still.

576
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,020
What are you doing? Stop beating him!

577
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,300
He is still young.

578
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,040
Stop beating him.

579
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,130
What are you talking about?

580
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
If we don't teach him a lesson now,

581
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,780
he'll go astray when he grows up.

582
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,380
He's just smart.

583
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,460
He was doing it for fun.

584
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,780
He didn't want to take the stuff inside.

585
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,030
Smart?

586
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,660
He knows how to open locks at home at such a young age.

587
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,800
What will he do when he grows up?

588
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,670
To rob the bank?

589
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,950
Chufeng, come here.

590
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,200
Apologize to your dad now.

591
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,650
Say you won't do it again.

592
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,610
Say it.

593
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,850
What mistake? Don't apologise.

594
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,260
You've been spoiling him.

595
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,330
If we don't teach him a lesson when he's young,

596
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,590
what will he do when he grows up?

597
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,050
He will become a thief.

598
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,720
Chufeng.

599
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,580
I'm not what you think I am.

600
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,810
You don't know me at all.
