00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,460
Don't worry.

6
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,090
I know what to do.

7
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,860
I will let him compete with me

8
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,700
according to our previous agreement.

9
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,820
I will win.

10
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,420
This is my best chance to revenge.

11
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:53,850
Alright.

12
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,810
There's a problem outside.

13
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,550
I need to deal with it.

14
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,380
I know him too well.

15
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,460
Even if you kill me,

16
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,740
someone will avenge for me.

17
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,680
We want to destroy him.

18
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,860
I want to destroy him myself.

19
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,860
I am him.

20
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,020
I made him.

21
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,500
That man...

22
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,090
I won't let him succeed.

23
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,310
No matter what revenge it is,

24
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,640
and what conspiracy it is,

25
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,190
I must find him.

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
I will find him.

27
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,260
The person behind Gu Nan

28
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,840
has always been you, right?

29
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,220
No.

30
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,760
That can't be you.

31
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,840
Stop looking.

32
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,300
I will.

33
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,790
But it's not you.

34
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,580
I must find him.

35
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,630
He is the one who has been helping Gu Nan behind the scenes.

36
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,750
He told Gu Nan everything,

37
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,760
all the clues,

38
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,380
everything about you,

39
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,230
and everything about me and you.

40
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:44,820
It's him.

41
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,370
He told Gu Nan.

42
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,080
He is very likely to be

43
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,280
the next person to kill you.

44
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,030
He won't hurt me.

45
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,310
He's dead.

46
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,100
There has never been another person.

47
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,630
Everything you saw is fake.

48
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,680
I heard it with my own ears.

49
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,570
He called another person.

50
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,200
He said he wanted to take revenge on you.

51
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,510
He said it himself.

52
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,480
He...

53
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,180
Even if it's not him,

54
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,060
there must be someone else.

55
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,980
They want to destroy you

56
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,800
and let you destroy yourself.

57
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,930
There are two people.

58
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,860
Sui Yi saw them.

59
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,440
There's one more person.

60
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,860
There must be another one.

61
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,500
There's no one else.

62
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,310
It has always been himself.

63
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,290
He's always alone.

64
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,090
I've managed to

65
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,220
reach out to He Chufeng.

66
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,340
I work near him.

67
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,840
Can you

68
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,150
solve it?

69
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,220
No problem.

70
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,030
I have something more on him.

71
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,409
There's a problem outside.

72
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,560
I need to deal with it.

73
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,030
You're here.

74
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,320
How long?

75
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,040
I've been waiting for the right time.

76
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,500
Waiting for the right time?

77
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,840
Until when?

78
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,520
What are you doing every day?

79
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,030
Do you really think you're a dishwasher?

80
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,500
Do you think

81
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,620
you live a peaceful life?

82
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:06,980
I...

83
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,460
Since you were released from prison,

84
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,500
you've been eating and playing every day

85
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,230
and did nothing.

86
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,920
I've been waiting for a chance.

87
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,510
I can do it.

88
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,560
What?

89
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,870
I can do it.

90
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,820
I can do it.

91
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,010
Think about

92
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,750
who took

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,360
things you lost?

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,970
You should take it back!

95
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,760
You should take it back!

96
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,200
You should take it back!

97
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,660
It's always just him.

98
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,190
There has never been anyone else.

99
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,040
He was shocked in prison.

100
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:21,980
Mr. Jin is the person

101
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,060
he met in prison.

102
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,660
His left hand was injured.

103
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,310
He couldn't pick locks for the rest of his life.

104
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,380
He's been looking for me since he were released from prison.

105
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,370
He tried to destroy me.

106
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,539
He tried his best to get close to me,

107
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,260
and to get close to you and Sui Yi.

108
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,620
It's all because of me.

109
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,490
It's me

110
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,290
who brought him obsession

111
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,250
and pain.

112
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,500
It's me

113
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,470
who brought you so many misfortunes.

114
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,990
It's all because of me.

115
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,490
So,

116
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,590
I feel very guilty.

117
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,930
I feel so guilty.

118
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,650
Robin.

119
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,210
Can you tell me

120
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,120
what I should do?

121
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,280
It's me.

122
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,940
You gave me

123
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,300
a new life

124
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,180
and courage to live hard.

125
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,340
But because of me,

126
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,910
you lost your beloved things.

127
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,110
What should I do?

128
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,810
Who would have thought

129
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,210
things would turn out like this?

130
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,330
You did nothing wrong.

131
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,700
Don't blame yourself.

132
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,660
Chufeng,

133
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
you are afraid

134
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,200
of bring trouble to others.

135
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,200
You're a good friend.

136
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,760
That's what I thought since high school.

137
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,770
No matter what happens in the future,

138
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,970
don't blame yourself

139
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,010
and don't feel lonely.

140
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,420
Robin.

141
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,500
All right.

142
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,490
There's no one else.

143
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,100
That's a relief.

144
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,410
I'll take care of it.

145
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,000
Wait.

146
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,510
Wait.

147
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,660
I can...

148
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,140
-I can pretend I know nothing. -True is true.

149
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,010
Fake is fake.

150
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,260
Chufeng,

151
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,430
I'll always be

152
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,950
your best partner.

153
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,100
What's your name?

154
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,310
He Chufeng.

155
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
He Chufeng?

156
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,940
We meet everywhere.

157
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,770
Hello, He Chufeng.

158
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,830
You are

159
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,690
my best friend forever.

160
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,100
Coming.

161
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,700
What's wrong?

162
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:30,840
I checked it for you.

163
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,820
You went to dinner by haulage motor

164
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,780
after the auction.

165
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,960
Someone had been following you.

166
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,500
He works for Cheng Wen.

167
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,980
Cheng Wen wanted to marry you

168
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,960
and get the transportation route

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,070
of artworks from your family.

170
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,070
Let go!

171
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,040
Let go!

172
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,630
He was involved in

173
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,800
Ji Xiuyi's illegal transport business.

174
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,240
So he wanted to save the beauty

175
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,220
and threatened you with his men.

176
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,480
After you woke up, you chose to forget a lot

177
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,140
and met me.

178
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,150
If you hadn't met me that day...

179
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,960
I would have married that bastard

180
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
and lived a life I don't like

181
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,330
for the rest of my life.

182
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,430
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,510
What's wrong?

184
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,840
I didn't spend much time with you

185
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,630
a while ago.

186
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,330
It's okay.

187
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,780
It's enough that I know you love me.

188
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,740
I love you.

189
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,900
I love you so much.

190
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,880
Me too.

191
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,260
If one day,

192
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,500
you meet someone whom you like more...

193
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,320
What are you talking about?

194
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,180
I hope you are happy

195
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,520
from the bottom

196
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,500
of your heart.

197
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:26,829
Hello.

198
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,910
You finally remember to call me.

199
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,360
Where are you?

200
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,010
I'm home.

201
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,910
Listen.

202
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,270
Uncle Lu and I

203
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,750
just viewed a house.

204
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,340
That house is great.

205
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,050
The direction and lighting

206
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,910
are very good.

207
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
The house is in the center of town,

208
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,100
with three bedrooms, one living room and one dining room

209
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,500
The surroundings are well matched.

210
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,260
There are kindergarten, elementary school and middle school.

211
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,340
-All... -No need to buy it for me.

212
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,700
I can't live here.

213
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,050
What's wrong, Binbin?

214
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,200
Mom.

215
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,860
I've always loved you.

216
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,930
I always know.

217
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,380
By the way, Binbin,

218
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,140
your birthday is next month.

219
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,820
Let's celebrate your birthday together, okay?

220
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,840
I have somewhere to go.

221
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,250
I don't think we can celebrate it together this year.

222
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,570
Where are you going?

223
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,990
Are you going with An?

224
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,450
Binbin.

225
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,370
What's wrong?

226
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,950
Did you fight with An?

227
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,610
No.

228
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,350
We've always been fine.

229
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,400
That's good.

230
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,740
By the way,

231
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,580
happy birthday to you.

232
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,580
I heard it.

233
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,380
Okay.

234
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,120
I'll stop talking.

235
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,700
I...

236
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,920
I have something to do. Bye.

237
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,300
I'm here to turn myself in.

238
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,490
The public prosecution thinks

239
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,380
the defendant,

240
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,900
Luo Bin's crime is clear.

241
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,210
There is sufficient evidence.

242
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,750
According to the law, the defendant is guilty.

243
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,420
But because of his confession,

244
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,100
the punishment should be reduced accordingly.

245
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
Based on this case,

246
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,850
[The Court is of the opinion that the existing evidence is not sufficient to find that the defendant Luo has the subjective intention of direct murder.]

247
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,850
[But his behavior has constituted the crime of negligence causing death. In accordance with the provisions of Article 233 and Article 36 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,]

248
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,850
[the Court sentenced Luo Bin to six years in prison for the crime of causing death by negligence.]

249
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,500
it is recommended that the court sentence the defendant Luo Bin

250
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,600
to six years in prison.

251
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,810
[Did you meet Robin?]

252
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,660
[Let him rest for a few days.]

253
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,950
[Are you feeling better?]

254
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:35,890
Much better.

255
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,070
[Does it still hurt?]

256
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,800
No.

257
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,710
[Eat well. You've lost weight. You won't look good if you keep losing weight.]

258
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,430
I'll eat well.

259
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,970
Are you hungry?

260
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,030
Let me get you some food.

261
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,110
It's right this time.

262
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,540
♫Making noise alone and messing around alone. It's also good to be alone♫

00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:05,560
[Chufeng, I'm a little tired.]

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,150
♫And I hate that I'm not brave enough♫

♫I chose to run away cleverly every time♫

♫My heart broke into pieces, and no one wanted to pick them up♫

This time,

I really lost them.

I can never find them again.

314
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,180
If I had been alone from the beginning,

315
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,040
they wouldn't have met me.

316
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,510
Then their lives

317
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,930
would be happy.

318
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,980
Are you really leaving?

If you really leave,

320
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,020
when they come back and want to see you,

321
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,330
they can't see you.

322
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,870
That's the real loneliness
