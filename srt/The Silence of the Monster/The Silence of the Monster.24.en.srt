5
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,270
Are you tired?

6
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,510
No, no.

7
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,440
I just came out for some fresh air.

8
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,560
I've prepared the skewers.

9
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,199
I saw it.

10
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:10,860
Anything else?

11
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,650
I'll do it now.

12
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,290
That's all.

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,420
Have a good rest.

14
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,660
Tonight you will be busy.

15
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,120
You...

16
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,740
Do you want to be a chef?

17
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,320
Chef?

18
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,230
Yes.

19
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,410
I thought that being a chef was good in the jail.

20
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,110
The salary is high and the position is popular.

21
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,490
How about

22
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,950
learning from Gao later?

23
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm afraid I can't.

24
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:38,970
Why?

25
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,010
My hands

26
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,560
can't do it.

27
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,920
I can only do some easy things like preparing skewers.

28
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,820
I can't do tiring work.

29
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,340
But don't worry.

30
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,670
I can take care of myself.

31
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,160
You have a good mindset.

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,960
There's nothing good or bad about it.

33
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,030
Life

34
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,740
should go on, right?

35
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,730
Don't worry.

36
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,140
I'll practice my left hand more.

37
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,330
I promise

38
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,700
I will do it faster than before.

39
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,290
Thank you for your hard work.

40
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,570
Work hard.

41
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,520
What's wrong?

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,130
Why are you sighing at such a young age?

43
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,060
Come on.

44
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,060
Tell Ms. Chen.

45
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,430
I'll give guidance to you.

46
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,130
Nothing.

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,770
Hello, is it going to rain?

48
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,500
There's a dark cloud here.

49
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:51,960
No.

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,460
Dark cloud is not with me.

51
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,220
It's my friend.

52
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,920
What's wrong with your friend?

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,000
A friend of mine.

54
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,910
She always thinks that her boyfriend

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,800
is hiding something from herself.

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,460
Hiding something from herself?

57
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,470
It's normal.

58
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,520
What kind of problem is that?

59
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,710
Let me tell you.

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,700
Even if it's a boy-girlfriend relationship,

61
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,850
who doesn't have privacy?

62
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,779
Besides,

63
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,899
the distance makes beauty.

64
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,580
According to my research,

65
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,450
giving each other some space in love

66
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,050
is good for

67
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,800
developing a relationship.

68
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,340
What if another girl

69
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,300
wrote him a love letter?

70
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,400
Love letter?

71
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,010
Such an important clue!

72
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,780
What kind of love letter?

73
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,500
What is the content?

74
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,900
I don't know.

75
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,620
I didn't see it.

76
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,630
You didn't see it?

77
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,950
How did you know it was a love letter?

78
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,840
My friend told me.

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,890
Your friend's boyfriend?

80
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,850
But as far as I know,

81
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,420
no other girls

82
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,270
chase Mr. He?

83
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,520
Did I get the wrong information?

84
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,050
Not me.

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,630
It's a friend of mine.

86
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,150
Sui Yi.

87
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,460
Do you know

88
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,250
there is a word called making up stories?

89
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,130
I didn't make it up.

90
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,200
Generally speaking,

91
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,700
when a person consults a relationship problem,

92
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,080
my friend is me.

93
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,070
My friend's relationship problem

94
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,530
is my relationship problem.

95
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,390
My friend's boyfriend

96
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,770
is my boyfriend.

97
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,140
This is called making up stories.

98
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,650
Report.

99
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,730
Here's the thing.

100
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,460
Are you sure it's a love letter?

101
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,520
Robin told me.

102
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,050
Robin?

103
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,820
Robin won't lie.

104
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,560
Are you sure he won't lie?

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,840
Maybe he was joking.

106
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,440
I thought too much.

107
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,270
Look.

108
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,300
Look.

109
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,270
You don't have solid evidence.

110
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,690
Don't lawyers value evidence the most?

111
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,220
If this is really a love letter,

112
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
it'll be exposed.

113
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,600
Even if he can hide it this time,

114
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,790
he can't hide it from you next time.

115
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,750
But people like He Chufeng

116
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,930
is very popular.

117
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,900
It's so easy to receive a love letter.

118
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,430
But he should be honest with Sui Yi.

119
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,340
No.

120
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,420
Men

121
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,710
will never take the initiative to explain.

122
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,700
Or he is just finding himself a hard time.

123
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,530
For love,

124
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,780
isn't honesty the most basic?

125
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,190
That's an idealistic operation.

126
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,170
Why do I feel that after falling in love,

127
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,980
annoyance have increased?

128
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,030
Let me

129
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,480
do my best

130
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,600
to tell you a sentence.

131
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,570
What is it?

132
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,570
When you're in love,

133
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,730
don't be swayed by considerations of gain and loss.

134
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,830
You should cherish what you have now,

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,640
and enjoy the present happiness.

136
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,870
Don't doubt at your own will.

137
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,620
Don't doubt easily.

138
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,380
Trust your charm.

139
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,600
Of course,

140
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,460
if he

141
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,820
really makes a huge mistake,

142
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,020
don't be soft-hearted.

143
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,100
Deal with it quickly.

144
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,180
I will introduce

145
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,620
many handsome boys for you.

146
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,090
Is it a sentence?

147
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,460
There are commas in the middle.

148
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,660
So did the clouds go away?

149
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,650
The rain cleared up, right?

150
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,740
It sounds like

151
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,030
you've dated several times.

152
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,650
It's excellent for me

153
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,800
to have this notebook.

154
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,940
A foreign institution recently released

155
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,900
a confidential document that has been kept for the longest time.

156
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,650
This document records the highest information transmission techniques

157
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,830
used by the diplomat，

158
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,430
invisible ink formula.

159
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,810
Do you know how much effort I put in it

160
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,300
to get this formula?

161
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,150
He Chufeng.

162
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,080
For you,

163
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,530
I took great pains!

164
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,420
I was exhausted!

165
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,740
I exerted my utmost effort!

166
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,750
Will this work?

167
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,980
Not sure.

168
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,020
No.

169
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,090
How do you know if you don't try?

170
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,380
Tartaric acid.

171
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,620
Potassium ferrous chloride.

172
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,340
Sodium sulfate.

173
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,330
Silver ions react with sulfate ions

174
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,140
to form a white silver sulfate precipitate.

175
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,980
Then it can be shown

176
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,700
on the colored paper.

177
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,540
This can't be found

178
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,380
easily.

179
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,420
If this doesn't work...

180
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,900
How do you know if you don't try?

181
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,630
You're worth teaching.

182
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,540
There's another way.

183
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,370
Go ahead.

184
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,390
Fire.

185
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,470
Wait.

186
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,090
What?

187
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,250
Are you sure?

188
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,460
If this letter is sodium nitrate solution,

189
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,770
and people write on it and dry it,

190
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,510
it's hard to tell its handwriting.

191
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,660
If we ignite its edge,

192
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,300
the heat in the part will make sodium nitrate dissolve

193
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,370
and turn into oxygen and sodium nitrate.

194
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,550
And the oxygen will only help with the combustion.

195
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,220
At that time, the part of handwriting in the paper

196
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,900
will burn more easily

197
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,380
than the part next to it.

198
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,090
And it'll appear by fire.

199
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,040
Hold on.

200
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,040
He Chufeng.

201
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,210
Can you finish it once?

202
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,370
I'll ignite it.

203
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,740
Go ahead.

204
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,690
I really ignite it.

205
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,900
Cut the crap.

206
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,210
Look.

207
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,720
The handwriting will slowly...

208
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,500
Wait, wait.

209
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,460
See if the partial handwriting

210
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,420
will appear.

211
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,360
Do you want to say something?

212
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,780
Say something?

213
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,600
What should I say?

214
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,980
Forget it.

215
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,420
I'd better not.

216
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,980
If this letter

217
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,820
can't be shown perfectly

218
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,810
in front of me,

219
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,180
just wait to be destroyed

220
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,060
like this letter.

221
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,730
I'm already half destroyed.

222
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,500
But

223
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,620
I still have this.

224
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,670
You're back.

225
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,650
Sui Yi,

226
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,300
do you care about

227
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,690
the letter?

228
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,110
No need to tell me.

229
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,710
Everyone has their own secrets.

230
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,860
Me too.

231
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,700
We should give each other some space

232
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,040
and our own lives.

233
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,100
You must have your reasons for not telling me.

234
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,860
Tell me when you think

235
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,700
you can tell me.

236
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,210
Okay.

237
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,490
By the way,

238
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,560
Xiaoyue released a new single.

239
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,380
I'll play it for you.

240
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,960
It's really good.

241
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,360
What did you use to make it appear?

242
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,450
The modified version of Lumino reagent.

243
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,770
In other words, this letter is...

244
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,560
The game begins when you are reading.

245
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,410
What is it?

246
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,390
I'll read the other three first.

247
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,140
Wait, what is this?

248
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,510
I don't know.

249
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,420
Is it the international locksmith competition

250
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,420
you told me before?

251
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,040
No.

252
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,150
Then what is it?

253
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:38,910
I don't know.

254
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,060
But your name was written in the letter.

255
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,710
and it was sent to you.

256
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,590
I said I don't know.

257
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,380
Can you stop saying you don't know?

258
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,090
Can you

259
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,580
stop walking around me?

260
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:50,690
Fine.

261
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,460
Many people

262
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,520
have secrets they can't tell.

263
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,570
I understand.

264
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,850
I will never interfere with your privacy.

265
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,950
But as your friend,

266
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,520
I have to remind you.

267
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,290
Don't get involved in some things.

268
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,670
I think

269
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,740
it's a bit harsh.

270
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,420
This is blood!

271
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,930
I don't know what blood it is,

272
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,810
it could be ox blood,

273
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,830
pig blood or sheep blood.

274
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,340
We don't know who sent it,

275
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,860
but it was sent to you.

276
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,180
Do you think it's really a good thing?

277
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,010
Do you think you're writing a novel?

278
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,590
This is the first time

279
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,530
I see the content of this letter.

280
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,220
But

281
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,300
I've seen this envelope before.

282
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,230
I saw the same envelope

283
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
at Gu Nan's place.

284
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,660
How have you been?

285
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,860
Pretty good.

286
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,440
Your birthday is coming.

287
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,140
I have half a day off today.

288
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,560
I picked it specially.

289
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:08,980
Thank you.

290
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,160
Is it beautiful?

291
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,490
The carving is delicate.

292
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,569
It's very vivid.

293
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,900
They said owl represents happiness

294
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,490
and wisdom.

295
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,140
This is my blessing to you.

296
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,300
Thank you.

297
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:34,840
Chufeng.

298
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,490
We still have a long way to go.

299
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,840
You have to live a good life.

300
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,440
By the way,

301
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,720
I have a question for you.

302
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:58,770
What is it?

303
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,190
Forget it.

304
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,850
It's not a big deal.

305
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,680
I will ask another day.

306
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:08,790
Okay.

307
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,940
Is it bad luck these days?

308
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,500
I really hate my personality.

309
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,170
Can't I just ignore it?

310
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,420
Why did my worries increase

311
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,140
after falling in love?

312
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,290
What's wrong with me?

313
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,170
Why have I been in a trance lately?

314
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:05,950
Did...

315
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,730
Did you ask?

316
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,090
Get out.

317
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,770
Excuse me.

318
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,560
Did you ask?

319
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,400
No.

320
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,140
Why didn't you ask?

321
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,050
We need to figure this out as soon as possible.

322
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:25,810
What if someone notice you

323
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,690
and something happens to you?

324
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,830
Don't forget

325
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,620
you are not alone now.

326
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,240
What are you two talking about?

327
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,990
You're so mysterious.

328
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,040
It's a secret between men.

329
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,310
Don't listen to him.

330
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,120
Tell me then.

331
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,820
I'll leave the battlefield to you.

332
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,850
I'll go to bed.

333
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,690
Do you care about

334
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,450
the letter?

335
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,430
No.

336
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,700
I don't care.

337
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,150
Liar.

338
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,900
I don't care.

339
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,380
That letter is not a love letter.

340
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,220
Then what is it?

341
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,320
But I can't tell you now.

342
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,620
But Robin said

343
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,280
it's a love letter.

344
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,700
Do you believe in Robin or me?

345
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,260
In that case,

346
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,380
I trust you, of course.

347
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,220
But...

348
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,630
Okay.

349
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,420
Wait for me.

350
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,620
Who?

351
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,300
Get up.

352
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:01,990
What are you doing?

353
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,210
No, no, no.

354
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,980
Let me put on my shoes first.

355
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,240
You say what do you want to do first.

356
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,150
I want to sleep.

357
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:10,750
Come in.

358
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,260
Tell her.

359
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,850
What?

360
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,540
Did you tell her

361
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,500
that letter was a love letter?

362
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,460
I made a mistake.

363
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,180
That's not a love letter.

364
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,060
Then what is it?

365
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,460
Can I tell her?

366
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,740
Do you just want to know

367
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
if it's a love letter?

368
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,030
What is it?

369
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,260
You can go back to sleep.

370
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:35,840
No.

371
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,810
What?

372
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,000
He has explained everything.

373
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,860
You can trust me now.

374
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,590
Go to bed.

375
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,580
Stop.

376
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,380
You just explained

377
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,420
this is not a love letter.

378
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,410
But you didn't explain

379
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,540
what this is.

380
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,570
Can you two do it or not?

381
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,260
You two are a couple.

382
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,100
Can you let me go

383
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,260
who has insomnia and whose heart is broken?

384
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,790
I'm tired today.

385
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,900
I just want to sleep.

386
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,110
Good night, okay?

387
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,180
Go to sleep.

388
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,060
I really didn't know

389
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,850
you care about these letters.

390
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,980
If I make some mistakes again

391
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,940
in the future,

392
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,390
making you upset or angry,

393
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,740
you must tell me directly.

394
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,260
Actually, I'm not mad at you.

395
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,620
I'm mad at myself.

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,990
Why?

397
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,580
Before I fell in love with you,

398
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,780
I didn't think

399
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,530
about anything.

400
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,230
I just need to be myself.

401
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,920
I felt so free back then.

402
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,860
But after I fell in love,

403
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,470
I became very sensitive.

404
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,090
I didn't mean to suspect you.

405
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,050
I know I have to trust you.

406
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,870
But I can't help

407
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,920
thinking nonsense.

408
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,060
I don't like my state.

409
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,940
And I don't like

410
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,560
that I don't trust you.

411
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,160
It makes me feel guilty.

412
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,440
It's not that you don't trust me.

413
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,720
You're worried about me.

414
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,720
I'll adjust myself.

415
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,910
No, you don't need to.

416
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,900
I should give you a sense of security.

417
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,540
You're worried about me.

418
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,700
I'm so happy.

419
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,930
It means you care about me.

420
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,890
I feel more guilty now.

421
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,570
Don't be so nice.

422
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,440
I want to change it. I'll change it.

423
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,830
You don't have to.

424
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,980
I want to change.

425
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,500
No need.

426
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,890
I want to change it.

427
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,920
No need.

428
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,360
I can finally sleep.

429
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,310
Who is it?

430
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,650
Hello.

431
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,230
I just sent you a message.

432
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,020
In case you didn't see it,

433
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,390
so I called you.

434
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,510
We agreed to go to the exhibition tomorrow.

435
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,650
Don't be late.

436
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,170
Tomorrow?

437
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:20,980
Yes.

438
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,940
Have you forgotten?

439
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,460
I was afraid you would forget.

440
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,600
Luckily, I called you.

441
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,190
Okay.

442
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,240
Why are you so perfunctory?

443
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,900
Can't you be more enthusiastic to me?

444
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,930
OK.

445
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,850
I'm very passionate.

446
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay.

447
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,290
I'll wear clothes in warm color tomorrow.

448
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,420
You have to dress up to match me.

449
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,320
Okay.

450
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,680
Bye.

451
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,590
I'll cheer myself up.

452
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,990
I'm going to start a new life

453
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,250
and meet new friends.

454
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,280
I can do it.

455
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,370
This place is so beautiful.

456
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,460
Take some photos for me.

457
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,500
Use portrait mode.

458
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,340
Okay.

459
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,270
Hold the clothes for me.

460
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,670
Lower the angle.

461
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,300
Let me see.

462
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,820
It's pretty good.

463
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,380
Let's go over there.

464
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,100
It's nice there.

465
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,060
Aren't you here for the exhibition?

466
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,540
I'm here to take photos.

467
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,420
This is not right.

468
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,000
We're here to view and learn from artworks.

469
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,300
Artwork need respect.

470
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,110
These things won't run away.

471
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,990
Let's view and learn later.

472
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,800
Let me take a photo first.

473
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,020
Okay.

474
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,220
Are you done?

475
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,030
Yes.

476
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,420
-Okay. -Let's go over there.

477
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,750
It's beautiful too.

478
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,820
I'm standing here.

479
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,870
Qiqi, listen to me.

480
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,610
Don't call me Qiqi.

481
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,470
I'm not Mickey.

482
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,460
I know.

483
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,960
We did not explain the situation to you in advance

484
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,540
about this.

485
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,340
I admit it was my negligence.

486
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,590
Don't be angry.

487
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,850
♫We're not alone♫

488
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,100
I promise

489
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,580
I'll ask for your opinion on everything later.

490
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,350
♫We're not alone♫

491

♫I found you♫

Come on.

502
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,160
I bought you juice tea.

503
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,630
This juice tea is very popular recently.

504
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,870
I bought some for everyone.

505
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:24,690
Here.

506
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,260

Thank you.

512
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,540
Thank you.

513
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,120
Lawyer Yu,

514
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,980
try this.

515
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,260
This peach and red grapefruit flavor is very delicious.

516
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,250
Try it.

517
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,720
Thank you.

518
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,660
Come on.

519
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,750
Come on and take it.

520
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,370
Come on.

521
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,450
Come on.

522
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,300
Sui Yi treats you to juice tea.

523
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,820
Thank you, Sui Yi.

524
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,460
Meco juice tea

525
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,570
is delicious and healthy.

526
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,020
All of us,

527
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:58,610
say thank you to Sui Yi.

528
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,920
Thank you, Sui Yi.

529
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,960
Thank you, Sui Yi.

530
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,450
You're welcome.

531
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,380
Thank you, Sui Yi.

532
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,980
I find

533
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,660
Sui Yi is a good girl.

534
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,900
She's serious and meticulous.

535
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,030
I asked her to help me with a document last time.

536
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,780
She did it for me without hesitation.

537
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,330
And she did a great job.

538
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,160
It should be easy to work with her.

539
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,490
It's not bad.

540
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,700
Although she was a bit clumsy when she first came here,

541
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,980
but it's nothing.

542
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,020
As a newbie,

543
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,740
it's normal

544
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,060
that newborn calves are not afraid of tigers.

545
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,140
As long as she's capable.

546
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,280
I think she can

547
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,200
become a regular employee later.

548
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,740
It depends on her future performance.

549
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,100
Yu,

550
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,700
why don't you drink the juice tea?

551
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,870
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

552
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,380
That's good.

553
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Sui Yi and Yu

554
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,050
are both interns, right?

555
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,540
But I asked Yu to help me sort out the documents last week.

556
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,120
It was a mess.

557
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,740
I stayed up all night

558
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,200
to solve it.

559
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,460
No wonder Mr. Zhou said he has poor foundation.

560
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,580
It makes sense.

561
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,720
He attended the exam for four years.

562
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,060
He passed it in the the last year

563
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,260
because he signed up for an assured class.

564
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,730
100,000 yuan!

565
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,080
100,000!

566
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,420
Bean Bun.

567
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,140
Bean Bun.

568
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,020
Time to eat.

569
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,300
Bean Bun.

570
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,020
Bean Bun.

571
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,220
Bean Bun, time to eat.

572
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,930
What are you doing?

573
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,380
Did you see Bean Bun?

574
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,480
Bean Bun?

575
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,260
I didn't see it.

576
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,230
I can't find Bean Bun.

577
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,980
Have you searched all over rooms?

578
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,180
I'll go check the yard.

579
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,460
Take its favorite toy.

580
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,220
Bean Bun.

581
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,700
Bean Bun.

582
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,420
Bean Bun.

583
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,910
Bean Bun.

584
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:22,980
Where's Bean Bun?

585
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,140
I bought it a new toy.

586
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,300
Bean Bun is gone.

587
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,420
Bean Bun?

588
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,420
Is it gone?

589
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,850
Have you searched here?

590
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,200
Yes.

591
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,420
-Bean Bun? -I'll go check the kitchen.

592
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,060
Bean Bun?

593
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,020
Bean Bun?

594
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,770
Bean Bun?

595
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,960
I searched the yard.

596
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,470
It's not there.

597
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,730
Not in the kitchen.

598
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,520
The last time I saw Bean Bun,

599
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,420
it was on my desk.

600
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,480
Bean Bun.

601
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,340
I have to work overtime tonight.

602
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,140
I can't play with you.

603
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,140
Play by yourself.

604
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,150
I saw it at around eight.

605
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,010
Poor kid.

606
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,180
In the end,

607
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,580
we lived together.

608
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,420
What's wrong?

609
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,050
What about you?

610
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,090
It was still there at 9:30.

611
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,930
Where did it go?

612
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,760
Let's go out and look for him.

613
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,170
Let's go.

614
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,310
Bean Bun.

615
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,470
Bean Bun.

616
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,340
Bean Bun.

617
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,900
I'll put up a notice for missing cat.

618
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,890
Bean Bun.

619
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,050
Bean Bun.

620
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,550
Bean Bun.

621
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,620
Bean Bun.

622
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,790
Chufeng, Robin.

623
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,570
Go and take a look.

624
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,270
Hurry up.

625
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
This is bad.

626
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,950
He must be a habitual offender.

627
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:06,900
Excuse me.

628
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,740
Excuse me. Excuse me.

629
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
Excuse me.

630
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:12,990
Are you okay?

631
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,120
I think it might be him,

632
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,030
Tuda in the vegetable market.

633
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,810
I saw him sharpening a knife two days ago.

634
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,130
If he had a knife,

635
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,450
isn't Gao of grill house   also a suspect?

636
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,170
Gao is an honest man.

637
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,730
He can't even fight with others.

638
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,050
I think

639
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,610
the new assistant in his restaurant

640
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,590
is quite strange.

641
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,350
Was the assistant

642
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,190
guaranteed by

643
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,820
the guy who opened the lock

644
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,960
in the vintage shop?

645
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,970
I think that young man is quite honest.

646
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,280
Think about it. Unlocking.

647
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,250
Calm down.

648
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,500
I'm afraid.

649
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,260
He can open your lock in a couple of times.

650
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,020
Are you afraid?

651
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,430
If he really commits a crime,

652
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,640
it would be much easier.

653
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,880
That day,

654
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,680
I saw the girl from the milk tea shop

655
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,710
hates cats.

656
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:00,980
Yes.

657
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,900
I saw that stray cats

658
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,110
went to her shop

659
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,270
and got kicked out by her fiercely several times.

660
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,780
Milk tea shop?

661
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,790
Shouldn't you go to work?

662
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,050
Don't worry.

663
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,139
We're here.

664
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,659
Go ahead.

665
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,800
We'll let you know when we find it.

666
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,460
If anything happens,

667
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,420
contact with me.

668
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,030
Okay, go ahead.

669
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,110
Bye.

670
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,100
Take care.

671
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:39,860
Okay.

672
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,139
Bye.

673
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
Let's go and have a look.

674
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,810
Let's go.

675
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,240
Have you found Bean Bun?

676
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,020
Have you found Aunt Liu's Chess Room?

677
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,840
Granny Mi took it there.

678
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,890
And Uncle Zhang's house.

679
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,060
Bean Bun likes to play with Tang.

680
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,740
Will it go to his house?

681
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,100
Should we go to the guard?

682
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,860
Hello.

683
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,640
Yes, this is Sui Yi.

684
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,200
Change it to 1 p.m., right?

685
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,380
OK. Thank you.

686
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,480
Mr. Sui.

687
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,920

She has a court meeting this morning.

to deal with this.

Otherwise, everyone in the community

will be in panic.

Bean Bun is one thing.

708
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,710
And we don't know

709
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,850
who has been abusing the cat.

710
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,690
It's so hateful.

711
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,300
Cats are so cute.

Don't put them together.

Bean Bun.

Well.

755
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,150
Why is the bell of Bean Bun here?

756
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,920
There are stray cats in the back alley.

757
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,420
But I haven't seen Bean Bun.

758
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,360
Does anyone in your shop hate cats?

759

00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,020

Then...

765
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,930
Did you find anything unusual

766
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,740
in his house?

767
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,930
At the door.

768
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,500
I left after I gave things to him.

769
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:38,930
But...

770
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:43,940
Uncle Nan.

771
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,690
I'm sorry

for making you come here.

773
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,720
Don't mention it, Uncle Nan.

774
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,770
I'll go back to the shop then.

775
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,100
Okay, see you in the afternoon.

776
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,100
But I'm not sure.

777
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,730
I don't think Uncle Nan is that kind of person.

778
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,700
But I'm not sure.

Is there anything I can help you with?

I want to sell this.

OK. Let me see.

The series of Molyneux Mont Blanc.

00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,910

14K gold pen.

F gold.

793
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,120
Take a look.

Under the sunshine,

795
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,980
the resinous pen cap and pen

796
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,900
are glowing in red.

797
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,830
Not bad.

798
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,000
But the resin is usually esy to get ground.

799
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,790
It's inevitable to get scratches after using it for a long time.

800
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,190
But there are almost no scratches on this one.

801
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,060
Let me take a look.

802
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,810
The tip of the pen with square head

803
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,660
is a bit dull.

804
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,120
These two points

805
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,970
indicates that this pen is not used very often.

806
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:30,890
Then,

807
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,210
how much can I sell this pen?

808
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,340
The original price of this pen

809
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,500
is 5,110.

810

Now,

811
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,100
it should be sold to 3,500 to 4,000 yuan

812
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,220
or

813
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,850
4,200 to 4,500 yuan.

814
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,700
Not bad.

815
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,060
So expensive!

816
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,740
Isn't it good to be expensive?

817
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,400
Then I won't sell it.

818
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,970
Is the price inappropriate?

819
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,980
I'll add more for you.

820
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,780
No, no, no.

821
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,930
I picked it up

822
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,830
in the park.

823
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,440
I waited for a few days but no one came to pick it up.

824
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,940
I was thinking of selling it,

825
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,590
as long as it's enough for my meal.

826
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,090
But this pen is so expensive.

827
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,330
I won't sell it then.

828
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,250
I'll try to find its owner

829
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,620
Give him back the pen.

830
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,930
I'll help you find him. Don't worry.

831
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,710
You put it in our shop.

832
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,100
Because many people will come to my shop,

833
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,380
the probability of finding the owner

834
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,130
is bigger.

835
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:22,980
Later,

836
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,420
I'll take a photo of this pen

837
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,310
and print it out.

838
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
You can paste it in the park

839
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,260
so that

840
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,820
you don't have to wait there every day.

841
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,450
Okay.

842
