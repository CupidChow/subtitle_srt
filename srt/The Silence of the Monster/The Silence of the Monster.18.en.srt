But don't worry.

Robin will take care of her.

172
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,660

Have some rainbow cereal.

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,940
It doesn't have white sugar and is non-fried.

179
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,090
It's nutritious.

♫Goodbye. Thank you♫

181

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,130
How do you know I eat this?

183
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,730
♫This is a moment to be alone♫

184
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,560
I saw it in your room last time.

185
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,270
♫No, I don't think so♫

186
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,290
You noticed that?

187
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,380
This is delicious.

188
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
And it won't make you fat.

189
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,940
♫Look, this is the best excuse I know♫

190
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,930
I usually eat this for breakfast.

191
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,210
Let's eat this for breakfast from now on.

192

♫I can take you home♫

No.

194

I have to change my taste sometimes.

195

♫I'll greet you first♫

196
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,530
You can only choose one between I and eating a rainbow cereal.

197
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,470
♫Then let the deer go home with a sleigh♫

198
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,900
Then...

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,020

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,250
No.

206
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,620
Maybe he didn't notice that.

207
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,120
Should we call him?

208

What did I teach you?

246
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,080
To make ribs, you need to control the heat.

247
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,690
Look, this is overcooked.

I've cleaned the room.

you'll lose me.

Don't cry.

Why are you still here?

281
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,830
My family is short of money.

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,630
I want to make money.

283

How old are you?

284
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,470
You always think about making money.

Here.

286
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,480
Okay, wait a moment.

287
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:43,930
Boss.

288
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,670
By the way, boss,

289
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,930
we agreed to pay me today, right?

290
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,270
What are you doing?

291
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,500
I told you to talk about this after today.

292
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,220
Don't you understand?

293
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,430
Every time you say after today.

294
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,380
All you care about is money.

295
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:55,910
Get to work.

296
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,630
Hurry up.

297
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,730
Hurry up.

298
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,770
Don't think about nonsense.

299
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,260
Your dishes are ready.

300
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,000
You work for so long every day.

301
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,360
How much did the boss pay you?

302
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,140
What's wrong?

303
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,760
Are you upset?

304
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:27,970
No.

305
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,740
Look how smart the boss is.

306
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,530
You are so young.

307
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,920
Who else can he bully except you?

308
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,860
Tell me if you want.

309
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,970
I'll see if I can help you.

310
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,690
The boss never pays me.

311
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,250
How much?

312
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,130
He promised to give me 60 yuan a day.

313
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,370
I've been working for ten days.

314
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,480
He has to give me 600 yuan.

315
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,660
And then?

316
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,100
I want to get my own salary.

317
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,640
You're a good drinker.

318
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,140
Why didn't you buy

319
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,970
strawberry cake today?

320
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,480
Buy it yourself.

321
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,520
Why didn't you tell us when we were shopping?

322
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,450
It's okay. We'll eat it next time.

323
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,860
Now it's the most important part

324
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,630
tonight.

325
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,290
We can skip the rest.

326
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,120
But no one is allowed to leave halfway for this.

327
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,760
You didn't skip the dinner just now.

328
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,250
I shaved the scales.

329
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,020
I scrubbed the crabs.

330
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,980
I peeled onions.

331
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,910
How could I skip it?

332
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,349
All right, sit down.

333
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,700
Now,

334
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,109
it's time for us to exchange gifts.

335
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,069
This is our tradition.

336
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,890
This is the first time.

337
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,990
You can't speak for three minutes.

338
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,310
But I didn't prepare a gift.

339
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,490
It's okay.

340
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,500
I've prepared everything for you.

341
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,060
Alright.

342
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,540
Let me tell you the rules of the game.

343
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,380
First, let's rock, paper, scissors.

344
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,339
Whoever wins will choose first.

345
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,510
Easy, right? Come on.

346
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,710
Rock, paper, scissors.

347
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,180
It's me.

348
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,670
Then I want...

349
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,470
No.

350
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,020
It's decided.

351
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,900
Not this one either.

352
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,780
It's decided.

353
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,860
What's the point

354
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,940
to be anonymous?

355
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,400
I'm the organizer.

356
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,860
I have the final right to explain.

357
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,690
This is an unfair clause.

358
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,480
I can sue you.

359
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,910
No cheating.

360
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,340
I didn't.

361
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,350
What is it?

362
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,330
See for yourself.

363
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,150
A gift?

364
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,810
What is it?

365
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,940
See for yourself.

366
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,900
Do you know this?

367
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,270
I still remember this.

368
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,580
Let me give you a gift too.

369
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,140
Did you prepare a gift?

370
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,940
What's your name?

371
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,040
Robin.

372
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,940
Robins never do bad things.

373
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,240
They only sing for someone kindly.

374
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,280
How did you know the meaning of my name?

375
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,920
I owe Robin a gift.

376
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,610
But you didn't write a name on it.

377
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,480
Who can I ask for it later?

378
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,540
Name?

379
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,530
What do you want to call yourself?

380
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,570
Let's think of one for you.

381
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,970
Stop whispering to each other

382
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,210
and join the group activity, okay?

383
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,270
And you.

384
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,580
Stop lying down.

385
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,860
Come here to liven up the atmosphere.

386
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,540
Fine, forget it.

387
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,130
Let's write it down.

388
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,450
I need to mix.

389
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,540
An.

390
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,620
Who wrote it?

391
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,510
I won.

392
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,800
Do you like it?

393
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:22,940
This one is OK.

394
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,040
By the way,

395
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,540
what is this?

396
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,310
♫♫

397
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,020
Gosh.

398
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,070
Do you like it?

399
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,630
Although you always bully me,

400
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,690
scratch me,

401
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,220
and grab my sofa.

402
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,540
But from now on,

403
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,980
be good to me.

404
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,540
Got it?

405
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,360
Hurry, go up.

406
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,070
It likes it very much.

407
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,080
Come on.

408
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,620
Let's commemorate it.

409
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,400
Come here.

410
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,330
Three, two, one.

411
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,470
One more.

412
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,080
What a beautiful moment!

413
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,100
It's enough to commemorate it.

414
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,390
It's okay to take more photos.

415
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,530
It's a waste of photo papers.

416
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,660
Aren't photo papers used to take photos?

417
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,170
It's expensive.

418
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,290
What's expensive? I...

419
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,300
I'll buy it.

420
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:45,940
OK.

421
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,780
Go buy some.

422
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,710
I'll take photos for you after you buy them.

423
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,740
You go first.

424
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,690
Where can I buy it now?

425
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,780
I don't care.

426
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,710
I'll take photos for you after you buy them.

427
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,790
Hello.

428
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,840
Why would Dali hit someone?

429
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,100
We don't know yet.

430
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,680
All I know is that she works at a barbecue restaurant

431
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,870
and got the boss hospitalized.

432
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,050
Can she defeat others as a little girl?

433
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,790
I don't know.

434
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,440
Hello.

435
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,220
Dali.

436
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,200
Where is she?

437
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,650
Okay, I got it.

438
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,300
Found it.

439
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,970
Dali,

440
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,090
are you hurt?

441
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:56,790
I'm fine.

442
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,510
Gu Nan, where are you going?

443
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,630
Long time no see.

444
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,680
He Chufeng.

445
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:47,240
[2001]

446
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,750
Do you have the key?

447
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,740
It's been scrapped for years.

448
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,660
Where did I get the key?

449
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,820
Just dismantle it

450
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,850
to see if there are any parts available.

451
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,130
See for yourself.

452
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,850
Dude.

453
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,040
You're fast.

454
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,120
Sorry, it's not for sale.

455
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,430
Do you want to learn how to unlock?

456
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,940
Let me teach you.

457
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:13,610
No need.

458
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,690
Don't worry.

459
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,220
I have a certificate.

460
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,990
I'm not a liar.

461
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,000
It's legitimate.

462
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,410
Sorry.

463
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,290
The car is going to be torn down.

464
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,260
Did you learn the essay, The Pity of Zhong-Yong

465
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,580
when you were in school?

466
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,340
Don't waste your talent.

467
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,870
This is my contact information.

468
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,930
Call me when you've made up your mind.

469
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,810
Coming.

470
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,830
Come with me.

471
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:19,620
Hurry up.

472
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,680
He locked himself in there.

473
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,140
I don't know what to do.

474
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,080
I can't open it with the electronic password.

475
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,660
Excuse me.

476
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,940
I'll get you out of here.

477
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,060
Do you remember the password?

478
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
I didn't remember it long ago.

479
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,130
It's all your fault.

480
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,290
How can you forget that?

481
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,260
Look.

482
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,550
Because of you,

483
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,160
the baby is locked inside.

484
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,910
What should we do?

485
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,410
Sir.

486
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,680
Let's just saw off it.

487
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,200
Are you crazy?

488
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,230
What should we do?

489
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,690
How would I know?

490
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,280
Shut up!

491
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,260
Are you going to save the baby or not?

492
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,540
It's okay.

493
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,620
It'll open.

494
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,500
It opens.

495
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,040
Baby.

496
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,190
Baby.

497
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,000
You're out.

498
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,250
Baby.

499
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,850
It's okay.

500
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,330
Why are you so careless?

501
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,890
Thank you.

502
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,020
Don't do this again.

503
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,150
It's dangerous.

504
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,460
Thank you.

505
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,940
Thank you.

506
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,200
Don't cry, baby.

507
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,470
It's okay.

508
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,270
It's okay.

509
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,700
It's okay, baby.

510
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,580
It's okay.

511
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,530
When it comes to unlocking,

512
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,580
many people think

513
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
it's a bad thing.

514
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,460
That's how people are.

515
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,220
When something happens,

516
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,640
they think about the worst first.

517
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,500
They always feel that someone is trying to harm them.

518
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,630
As you can see,

519
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,640
we just unlocked

520
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,250
to save people.

521
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,900
It's a lock.

522
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,350
It's nothing good or bad.

523
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,780
It's not a bad thing to unlock the lock.

524
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,220
But saving people or harming people

525
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,380
depends on our hearts.

526
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,860
If you want to learn,

527
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,780
learn for being the first one.

528
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,960
If you want to try something new,

529
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,660
I won't teach you.

530
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,660
I want to be a locksmith

531
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,240
like you.

532
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,010
I didn't expect

533
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,540
we'll meet here again.

534
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,040
Master, calm down.

535
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,230
Get in.

536
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,560
Be good. Get in.

537
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:53,940
-Master. -Hurry up.

538
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,610
Be good.

539
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,730
Get in.

540
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,750
Master.

541
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,080
I went to pick you up that day.

542
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,480
I left early.

543
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,330
I've packed

544
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,960
your things.

545
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,040
It's always with me.

546
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,290
Those things

547
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,530
are not important.

548
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,580
Thank you.

549
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,699
Thank you.

550
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,900
Why aren't you coming?

551
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,530
Hello.

552
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,060
How can a parent be like this?

553
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:42,620
Officer Xiaoguo,

554
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,199
what did he say?

555
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,060
The owner of the barbecue restaurant said

556
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,290
Dali injured him.

557
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,850
But there's no surveillance camera in the shop.

558
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,360
The surveillance camera from the store opposite

559
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,350
can't see it.

560
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,699
We have to continue the investigation.

561
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,389
But the most tricky thing is

562
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,380
Dali can't explain herself.

563
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,150
Her uncle didn't come to pick her up.

564
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,900
Well,

565
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,750
Dali is underage

566
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,510
without a guardian.

567
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,960
We can do nothing.

568
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,130
Why are you with Dali?

569
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,490
That girl?

570
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,760
Yes, her name is Dali.

571
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,040
It's the festival.

572
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,440
I have nothing to do.

573
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,650
So I went to the barbecue restaurant for dinner.

574
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:39,860
I happened to see it.

575
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,430
You have to pay me now.

576
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,550
Cut the crap.

577
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,280
Let's talk tomorrow.

578
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,860
You always say tomorrow.

579
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,860
I quit tomorrow.

580
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,690
You must pay me today.

581
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:47,900
Quit?

582
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:48,850
Get lost if you don't want to.

583
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,300
That money is mine.

584
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,500
Here.

585
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,690
Get lost with the money.

586
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,280
Wait.

587
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,800
It's only over 200 yuan.

588
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,890
I've been working for ten days.

589
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,580
I don't care.

590
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,070
It's still more than 300 yuan short. Give me the money.

591

Brat.

595

Stop!

598
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,740
The boss is extorting her.

599
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,470
The girl didn't bump into him.

600
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,130
I saw the girl

601
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,450
running away in a hurry.

602
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,700
I followed her in case something happened.

603
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,810
I see.

604
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,730
I've told the police everything.

605
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,570
But with my current identity,

606
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,530
I just came out from the jail.

607
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,110
I don't know

608
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,680
how much the police can believe what I said.

609
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,640
Maybe they will find other evidence.

610
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,370
How is Dali?

611
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,090
Dali said

612
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,770
she didn't hit the owner of the barbecue restaurant.

613
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,980
Now the witness has proved it.

614
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,260
But the problem is

615
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,000
the owner of the barbecue restaurant concludes

616
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,880
it was her.

617
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,950
Is the boss badly injured?

618
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,260
Not really.

619
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,450
But the problem is he's going to the hospital now.

620

What can you do?

621
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,670
That alley is a blind spot.

622
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,940
Many surveilance cameras can't catch it.

623

What we can do now

624
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,570
is to find more surveillance cameras

625
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,570
and find out the truth.

626
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,920
I believe Dali didn't do it.

627
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,060
How about this?

628
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,570
I'll take the witness to testify.
