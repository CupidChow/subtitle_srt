Take your medicine.

You can only recover after taking the medicine.

Thank you.

16

It has nothing to do with you.

17
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,900
Everything will be fine.

18
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,250
Someone will love you.

You will love others with your heart.

The burst of Caixin Pay bubble

was involved in an intentional arson.

24

The suspect, Min,

has been arrested by the police

Fu Shuai will be sentenced to three to five years.

It has nothing to do with me.

34
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,150
I was too silly before.

35
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,260
I always believed in him.

36
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,040
I thought he really loved me.

37
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,780
I found out later that he just wanted to control me,

38
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,140
used me

39
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,600
and suppressed me.

40
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,980
He kept saying I'm lame.

41
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,220
You're not.

42
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,220
I know.

43
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm good.

44
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,500
So I'll go back and adjust myself.

45
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,040
I'll come back better.

46

By the way,

47
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,240
will someone pick you up?

48
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,120
Yes.

49
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,890
Don't worry. My sister will pick me up.

50
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,440
Okay.

51
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,020
Take care.

52
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,860
Have a good rest.

53
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,820
We'll talk about it later.

55
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,220
Thank you so much.

56
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,520
I'm leaving.

57
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:56,920
Take care.

58
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,140
Lily always comes to me with all kinds of bags

59
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,950
for identification.

60
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,130
She is concerned about the authenticity and price of the bag.

61
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,120
But she sold all the real ones

62
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,120
and left fake ones.

63
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,220
Because she said

64
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,770
they were gifts from her lover.

65
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,370
Then what is real

66
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,040
and what is fake?

67
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,510
I asked her why she didn't let go

68
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,400
or leave

69
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,650
and why she is immersed in the illusion

70
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
and lies to herself.

71
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,970
But is she really stupid?

72
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,570
She just wants to find someone

73
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,200
to protect her from storm.

74
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,680
But in the end,

75
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,820
this person brought the storm.

76
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,620
Maybe she knows it better than anyone.

77
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,000
Whether it's a show

78
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,820
or each takes what they need,

79
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,620
there is always truth in the illusion.

80
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,350
In this endless cold winter,

81
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,940
even a rare moment of warmth

82
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,260
and tenderness

83
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,490
is already precious,

84
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,780
which worths cherishing.

85
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,530
Do you like He Chufeng?

86
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,290
Do I like him?

87
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,220
I do like him.

88
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,170
Should I confess to him?

89
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,980
Of course. Take initiative bravely.

90
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,820
No, no, no.

91
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,260
The man has to take the initiative.

92

What era is it now?

93
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,500
Who cares who confesses first?

94

Besides,

95
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,370
it's not easy to meet someone you like.

96
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,659
If you don't hold on tight,

97
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,260
he will be in someone else's bowl.

98
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,300
No, no.

99
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,020
You have to think about this.

100
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,550
If your confession succeeds,

101
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,260
and you are really together,

102
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,410
someone will ask

103
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,740
who chased after whom.

104
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,220
What are you going to say?

105
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,630
We'll talk about it

106
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,700
after settling the present.

107
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,170
Does he like me?

108
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,810
Do you think he likes you?

109
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,860
I don't know.

110
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,780
Well,

111
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,860
if you confess,

112
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,970
there will be three outcomes.

113
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,810
A.

114
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,000
He likes you too.

115
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,059
He accepts your confession.

116
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,140
Then you two get together.

117
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,419
I like you.

118
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,940
Me too.

119
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,850
B.

120
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,380
He doesn't like you.

121
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,110
But for the sake of friendship,

122
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,120
he will be with you.

123
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,420
But what will happen?

124
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,950
You two will be very embarrassed.

125
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,680
I like you.

126
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,160
What?

127
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,610
You like this place?

128
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,630
Me too.

129
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,810
I mean

130
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,380
I want you to be my boyfriend.

131
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,190
What did you say?

132
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,010
Forget it.

133
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,210
He can't hear me.

134
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,010
What should I do?

135
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,770
But according to his personality,

136
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,540
he won't agree if he doesn't like you.

137
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,390
Then there's only outcome C.

138
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,210
He doesn't like you.

139
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,790
Then he rejects you.

140
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,500
I like you.

141
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,500
I'll go back now.

143
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,350
If that's the case,

144
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,890
we might not be able to

145
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,820
be friends anymore.

146
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,210
So not only will I feel awkward,

147
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,410
but also lose a rare friend.

148
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,540
I may not even be able to

149
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,850
stay in the vintage store anymore.

150
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,170
Let me calculate.

151
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,690
If that's the case,

152
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,650
the rent,

153
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,860
commission, moving expenses,

154
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,680
and cleaning expenses,

155
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,940
plus I'll definitely need to buy

156
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,820
new furniture products.

157
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,980
And the new rent

158
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,500
won't be lower than that of the vintage store.

159
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,520
This is the first time I saw

160

on whether to confess.

How is it going?

It's too hard.

What's wrong?

166
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,490
It's hard to guess a man's feelings.

Got it.

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,110
We

176
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,210
are normal good friends.

177
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,060
Normal good friends?

178
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,690
What do you mean by normal good friends?

179
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,130
Sui Yi and I

180
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,290
are normal good friends.

181
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,820
By the way,

182
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,640
Christmas is coming.

183
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,910
Then I wish you a Merry Christmas.

184
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,780
You can't even seize this opportunity.

185
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
That's too bad.

186
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,900
Even Cupid can't shoot you.

187
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,730
Then...

188
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,430
how can Cupid's arrow

189
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,800
shoot me?

190
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,280
Here.

191
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:34,850
All right.

192
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,160
Mr. Robin's class begins.

193
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,250
When it comes to confession,

194
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,580
listen to me,

195
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,880
scenario and the actual choice

196
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,650
is a very big learning.

197
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,650
The way of confession

198
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,080
bases on the girl's personality

199
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,100
and preference.

200
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,170
If this girl is enthusiastic

201
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,100
and exaggerated,

202
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,810
you need to prepare a fantastic scene

203
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
plus flowers, gifts,

204
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,250
and music.

205
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,760
Yes.

206
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,340
Set the mood with candlelight.

207
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,140
By the way,

208
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,020
there must be a lot of people around her.

209
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,920
Give her a grand confession ceremony.

210
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,960
Is Sui Yi like this?

211
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,910
I don't think so.

212
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,380
If she's a delicate

213
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,010
and sensitive girl,

214
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,220
she will definitely choose

215
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,780
to be alone with the person she likes.

216
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,960
Then you need to create a scene

217
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,410
with just the two of you to confess your love.

218
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,270
How?

219
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,540
Let me think.

220
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,700
When the night falls,

221
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,170
the whole city

222
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,420
is surrounded by the Christmas atmosphere.

223
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,970
The neon sparkles.

224
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,340
In a place where there are only two of you,

225
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,330
the atmosphere is warm and ambiguous.

226
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,770
You call her gently by her name.

227
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,550
Sui Yi.

228
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,620
She looks at you.

229
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,170
But you don't say anything.

230
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,010
You just slowly approach her.

231
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,000
Hold her hands with your warm hands

232
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,100
and stare at her eyes.

233
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,520
Be firm and gentle.

234
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,070
Then you get closer

235
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,090
and closer.

236
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,390
Looking at each other,

237
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,330
all the emotions in your eyes are flowing.

238
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,610
There is silence all around,

239
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,820
as if you can only hear

240
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,100
each other's heartbeat.

241
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,460
Thump.

242
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,700
Thump.

243
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,460
This is the time when you must say the phrase.

244
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,210
I...

245
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,920
I'm back.

246
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,020
What are you doing?

247
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,580
Nothing.

248
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:31,690
I promise.

249
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,150
Do you want to decorate it together?

250
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,320
What's wrong?

251
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,150
♫Getting closer to feel your gentle breathing♫

252

is laughing at us?

No.

333

It's laughing.

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,000
Then what's the problem?

345
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,030
I think Zheng Xingchuan likes Sui Yi.

346
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,650
But Sui Yi said

347
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,090
she was just her brother who practiced martial arts with her.

348
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,740
You can't trust what a woman says.

349
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,730
He has bad intentions.

350
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,670
The enemy seems more powerful

351
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,500
than I thought.

352
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,530
He Chufeng.

353
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,500
You need to be on level one alert.

354
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,740
If you don't do anything,

355
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,160
the next one sitting here

356
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,930
will not be this bear.

357
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,740
Wear your suit.

358
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,330
I'm back.

359
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,120
Why did you buy such a big bear?

360
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,390
So cute.

361
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,880
And a little card.

362
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,060
Dear Yisi.

363
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,650
I'm sorry I can't be with you for the time being.

364
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,860
Let it

365
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,130
spend this winter with you for me.

366
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,200
I miss you.

367
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,360
By the way,

368
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,670
there's a hidden surprise.

369
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,420
Look for it.

370
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,510
Yours, Zheng Xingchuan.

371
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,160
Press the left hand.

372
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,010
Good morning. Yisi.

373
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,570
Do your best today.

374
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,310
Yisi. Good night.

375
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,990
I didn't expect that.

376
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,470
Isn't it cute?

377
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,760
What are we having for dinner?

378
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,080
The pot is broken.

379
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,080
Figure it out yourself.

380
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,700
I can't help you.

381
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,830
Order takeout.

382
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,300
Zheng Xingchuan.

383
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,230
You're exaggerating.

384
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,540
Everyone saw it.

385
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,280
What should I do?

386
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,660
It is cute.

387
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,810
But it's too big.

388
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,340
What if it becomes a mistake?

389
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,230
Everyone saw it.

390
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,730
Do you know how embarrassed I was?

391
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,600
What are you doing?

392
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,860
What are you doing?

393
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,540
It's the end of the year.

394
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,060
We're here to check the safety measures.

395
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,250
Some bulbs are not on.

396
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,140
Chufeng.

397
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,930
Should we change them?

398
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,870
The switch.

399
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,640
Where is the switch?

400
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,460
The switch.

401
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,300
The switch.

402
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,970
I told you I should live on the third floor.

403
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,580
Look.

404
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,700
I can change with you if you want.

405
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,170
Really?

406
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
No, he won't change.

407
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,070
He's hallucinating.

408
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,340
Sui Yi.

409
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,110
Who is this Zheng Xingchuan?

410
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,930
Zheng Xingchuan

411
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,170
is my friend.

412
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,860
Your friend?

413
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,590
We grew up together.

414
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,470
You grew up together.

415
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,720
So he's your childhood sweetheart?

416
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,120
The festival is coming.

417
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,150
The festival is coming.

418
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,750
He was fat when he was young.

419
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,230
I don't know why

420
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,200
he suddenly lost weight.

421
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,130
I didn't expect him to look pretty when he loses weight.

422
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,760
You like fat boy?

423
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,370
It's good to lose weight.

424
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,490
Have you ever gained weight?

425
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,020
What a pity.

426
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,120
Then I have no choice.

427
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,260
Stop it.

428
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,120
It's just a gift for the festival.

429
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,570
Don't think too much.

430
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,980
I didn't say anything.

431
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,300
You've been talking.

432
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,940
Right?

433
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,500
Stop laughing.

434
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,130
Are you convinced?

435
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,740
♫Making noise alone and messing around alone. It's also good to be alone♫

436
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,270
Are you convinced?

437
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:24,600
♫Then let imagination control all my confusion♫

438
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,490

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,630
♫I pretend that I'm not that sensitive♫

440
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,350
♫And I hate that I'm not brave enough♫

441
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:40,320
♫I chose to run away cleverly every time♫

442
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,250
Don't tell on me.

♫My heart broke into pieces, and no one wanted to pick them up♫

♫I have to wait patiently for the shadows to go far away♫

447
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,920
Don't we have breakfast today?

448
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,030
There's milk and bread in the fridge.

This bear...

452
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,030
is too obvious.

453
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,070
A little.

454
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,780
♫I'm self-righteous to think that I'm insignificant♫

455

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,280
But it does occupy too much space.

00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:13,990
How about

461
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,380
I help you find a garbage recycling for you.

462
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,060
An on-site service?

463
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:19,940
Forget it.

464
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,620
After all, it is also a token of appreciation.

465
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,460
I'll just keep it.

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,980
Are you going to their law firm for an interview?

494

suit.

500
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,300
