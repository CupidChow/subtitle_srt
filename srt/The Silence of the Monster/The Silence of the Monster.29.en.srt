5
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:37,820
What do you think of

6
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,630
this book?

7
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,979
Not bad.

8
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,930
I think the rear part is more interesting.

9
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,520
Can you tell me

10
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,330
what is interesting?

11
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,630
It's just interesting.

12
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,000
But many people say

13
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,620
the rear part is worse than the front part.

14
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,490
Don't you think so?

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,300
Uncle,

16
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,190
don't you know this saying?

17
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,669
There are a thousand Hamlets

18
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,330
in a thousand people's eyes.

19
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,060
Even a child like me knows it.

20
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,110
I can't believe you don't know it.

21
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,900
I'm here

22
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,030
to ask you to give me some advice.

23
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,400
The press has issued a statement.

24
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,010
He even hired a lawyer.

25
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,620
What should I do?

26
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,570
I think this statement

27
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,980
was written by Sui Yi.

28
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,510
Shut up.

29
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,210
Then why didn't you hire a lawyer?

30
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,350
I didn't realize it.

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,630
I thought it was between me and him.

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,320
I didn't expect it to be so complicated.

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,070
He plagiarized. I disclosed it.

34
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,330
He issued a statement, and I released a post.

35
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,180
Nothing wrong.

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,920
It's not as easy as you think.

37
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,380
Don't you read the law books in your shop?

38
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,270
Will you delete what you posted?

39
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,420
No way.

40
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,020
I won't delete it no matter what.

41
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,510
He's the one who's wrong, not me.

42
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,940
I've made up my mind.

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,460
I'll fight him to the end

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,780
even it's a lose-lose situation.

45
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,220
Zheng, calm down.

46
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,060
Do you want a lawyer now?

47
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,060
Just in case.

48
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,329
Yes.

49
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,300
You need a lawyer.

50
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,460
I'll ask Sui Yi.

51
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,240
Don't bother her.

52
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,540
Her boss

53
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,100
is the legal advisor of the press.

54
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,079
Don't turn to her.

55
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380
Just stay outside the barrier.

56
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,590
I'm not going to ask her

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,060
to give me information.

58
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,950
I just hope that

59
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,780
she can recommend a lawyer to Zheng.

60
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,610
Is this not okay?

61
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,260
Besides, which one of us here knows a lawyer

62
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,540
apart from her?

63
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,860
There is no one we can ask except her.

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,620
Will Sui Yi introduce a lawyer to Robin?

65
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,970
Sui Yi. Sui Yi. Sui Yi.

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,590
Sui Yi.

67
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,330
What?

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,520
Sui Yi,

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,210
you know many lawyers, right?

70
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,250
Can you recommend one to Zheng?

71
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,610
Stop.

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
Zheng. Zheng.

73
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,790
Have you forgotten the barrier?

74
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm not here for information.

75
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,089
I want you to recommend

76
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,980
a reliable lawyer to Zheng.

77
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,410
A lawyer who is reliable

78
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,300
but doesn't work in your law firm.

79
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,000
Do you know

80
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,860
where the top student in your class works?

81
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,160
No, no, no.

82
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,900
It'd be better if you recommend someone who is senior to you

83
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,170
and is a rival of your company.

84
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,920
A strong rival

85
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,490
who always defeated you.

86
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,760
Can you recommend one to Zheng?

87
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,990
I can't recommend a lawyer to him.

88
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:44,860
Why?

89
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,659
Robin.

90
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,770
Can you stand in my shoes and

91
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,620
think from my perspective?

92
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,460
If I agree to recommend a lawyer to Zheng,

93
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,610
should I recommend a competent lawyer

94
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,380
or a weak one?

95
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,430
Of course a competent one.

96
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,370
Why do you need to think about it?

97
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:55,840
OK.

98
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,510
If I recommended the best lawyer I know

99
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,330
to Zheng,

100
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,350
what if we were defeated?

101
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,980
If we were defeated, I would indirectly

102
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,940
harm my client's interests.

103
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,540
My client's interests are

104
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,270
my top priority.

105
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,370
I can't do that.

106
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,500
Sui Yi.

107
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,220
What's wrong with you?

108
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,660
Where's your sense of justice?

109
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,810
Jiang Lu did something wrong.

110
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,820
Do you know that he stole Bai Tianhuan's work?

111
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,870
Zheng is on the side of righteousness.

112
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,740
Jiang Lu is a client of your boss.

113
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,740
That's right.

114
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,060
You have no choice because you work in the law firm.

115
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,340
I understand.

116
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,620
But I just want you to

117
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,050
recommend a good lawyer to Zheng.

118
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,130
Am I asking too much?

119
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,570
And Zheng is our good friend.

120
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,270
Even if he's not our good friend,

121
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,060
shouldn't you

122
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,860
take the side of righteousness?

123
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,610
Okay, I'll think about it.

124
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,790
I just said I'll think about it.

125
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,909
I didn't promise you.

126
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,580
You must think about it carefully.

127
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,500
You can leave now.

128
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,110
Okay, I know.

129
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,310
The sense of justice.

130
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,330
Don't forget the sense of justice.

131
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,120
Are you leaving or not?

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,170
The sense of justice.

133
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,540
You must think about

134
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,180
the sense of justice.

135
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,260
The sense of justice.

136
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,260
What did Sui Yi say?

137
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,770
She said she would think about it.

138
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,180
Robin.

139
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,120
I just thought about it.

140
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,440
I think I don't need Sui Yi

141
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,460
to help me with this.

142
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,260
It's not that I don't trust Sui Yi.

143
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,160
It's just we have different opinions

144
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,090
on the matter.

145
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,340
What else do you want to say?

146
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,380
Can you write a novel?

147
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,890
I can't believe I want to gain recognition

148
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,940
from a kid.

149
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,510
I can't sleep.

150
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,740
I'm terribly upset right now.

151
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,500
I want to ask your opinions.

152
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,540
But I can't tell you

153
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,580
why I'm upset.

154
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,500
I really don't know what to do.

155
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,740
I can't say anything.

156
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:53,760
But

157
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,420
can you tell me

158
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
what I should do?

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,440
I know why you are upset.

160
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,650
Your boyfriend is meant to

161
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,130
help you solve problems

162
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,390
when you're in trouble, right?

163
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,900
Although we have different areas of expertise,

164
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,120
in my heart,

165
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,570
I totally support you

166
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,650
to make the right choice.

167
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,380
If you have a problem

168
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,500
and you need my help,

169
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,710
just tell me.

170
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,300
Even if what you want is just a hug,

171
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,290
you can tell me.

172
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,640
I'll charge you.

173
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,460
Right, charge.

174
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,380
Charge.

175
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,299
Here.

176
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,780
Charge.

177
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,850
Isn't it funny?

178
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,740
Never mind.

179
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,570
That's enough for joking.

180
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,380
Cheer up.

181
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,240
There's always a solution to a problem.

182
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,710
You're great.

183
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,940
Sleep early.

184
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,540
You need to rest so that you can think.

185
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,560
Then I'll go upstairs and sleep.

186
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,110
You can sleep here.

187
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,690
Jiang Lu plagiarized.

188
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,020
But what Zheng did is not totally right.

189
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,770
If there was a lawsuit,

190
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,880
the law firm would definitely be on Jiang Lu's side.

191
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,190
But he is the one who made a mistake.

192
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,210
I can't just let Zheng

193
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,470
be wronged.

194
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,760
You are a lawyer,

195
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,450
Sui Yi.

196
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,180
Hello?

197
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,340
Hey, Robin.

198
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,060
Last time,

199
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,100
I introduced a friend to your place

200
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,900
for calligraphy identification.

201
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,560
Do you remember?

202
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,430
Yes.

203
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,010
What's wrong?

204
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,460
Can you help me check

205
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,440
his identification record

206
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,660
and see how many samples he brought

207
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,380
for identification?

208
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,130
Okay.

209
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,660
Tell me his name.

210
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,420
I'll check.

211
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,970
His name is Zheng Xiuyuan.

212
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,250
Okay, wait.

213
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,320
I'll let you know when I'm done.

214
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:06,700
Okay.

215
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,220
Thank you.

216
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,350
He brought 70 pages for identification.

217
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,390
The ending designed by Bai Tianhuan is amazing.

218
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,540
But what Jiang Lu wrote is ordinary.

219
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,070
This is an identification report from a judicial department.

220
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,480
He wants to buy your manuscripts?

221
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,450
How did he copy them back then?

222
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,830
I don't know.

223
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,740
We rented a house together.

224
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,240
Maybe he got them without me realizing it.

225
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,740
You again?

226
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,200
I'm here to chat with you.

227
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,540
You're here.

228
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,390
I wanted to visit you later.

229
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,700
Thank you so much.

230
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,560
Chufeng found me a lawyer.

231
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,530
So efficient.

232
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,150
You are really far-sighted.

233
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,990
Professionals

234
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,470
do things in a professional way.

235
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,760
Did you tell the lawyer the truth?

236
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,890
I asked my friend at the identification center.

237
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,270
The manuscripts you brought there have only over 70 pages.

238
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,900
But in that video,

239
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,190
there are over 300 pages.

240
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,600
Where are the rest pages?

241
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,590
In my room.

242
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,050
Zheng.

243
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,330
Have you forgotten that I'm an appraiser?

244
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,530
The calligraphy on these manuscripts was copied so badly.

245
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,700
How dare you show them in the video

246
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,670
to confuse people?

247
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,960
Did you copy all these?

248
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,300
It's not as easy as you think.

249
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,940
Do you know how many times

250
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,240
a book should be proofread and revised before being published?

251
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,550
If they look into it,

252
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,820
they will find that your so-called manuscripts

253
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,450
are just copies.

254
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,170
It's not as easy as you think.

255
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,260
You're so eager to testify for Bai Tianhuan.

256
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,460
I have no other way.

257
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,060
You have no other way?

258
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,930
You can ask us.

259
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,460
We can help you.

260
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,720
I even found someone to identify the calligraphy for you

261
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,980
and offered you ideas.

262
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,050
How dare you lie to me?

263
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,610
I just want to solve this on my own.

264
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,650
I don't want to trouble anyone.

265
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,670
I know

266
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,710
I did something very disgraceful.

267
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,640
But I don't want anything.

268
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,850
I just want him to admit that he plagiarized.

269
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,820
But I only have

270
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,660
the 70 pages left by Tianhuan.

271
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,820
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,610
You know it's disgraceful.

273
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,410
Then why did you do it?

274
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,150
You're using a lie

275
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,250
to uncover another lie.

276
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
This is what you are doing

277
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,460
for Bai Tianhuan?

278
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,860
What if your friend is wronged?

279
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,380
You know the truth but you couldn't do anything.

280
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,140
Won't you take the risk

281
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,500
and do something for your friend?

282
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,420
I will.

283
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,200
But I will do it in a proper way.

284
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,680
What if there's no proper way?

285
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,780
You shouldn't have kept it from us.

286
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,030
It's my fault.

287
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,100
But there are things

288
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,930
that I can't say.

289
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,960
Anything interesting today?

290
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,120
No.

291
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,050
Well,

292
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,760
did you learn anything interesting?

293
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,140
Is that all you want to talk about?

294
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,330
Actually, I just want to ask you this.

295
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,010
Have you seen

296
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,170
the manuscripts Zheng Xiuyuan always took with him?

297
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,240
Do you know the content?

298
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,580
Even just one sentence.

299
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,090
I don't know.

300
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,010
Can you tell me

301
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,200
which part of Flight on the Island

302
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,980
is more interesting?

303
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,170
If you keep asking,

304
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,010
I won't think it's interesting anymore.

305
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,850
Curly.

306
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,410
I told you

307
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,220
not to call me Curly outside.

308
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,490
Call me Bai Ye.

309
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,180
What's your name?

310
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,090
Bai Ye.

311
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,930
Why are you called Bai Ye?

312
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,130
My dad's best friend

313
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,060
gave me this name.

314
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,400
What's your dad's name?

315
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,200
Bai Tianhuan.

316
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,520
My mom told me that

317
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,800
my dad said

318
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
his friend is very talented.

319
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,720
He liked what he wrote very much.

320
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
He said although his writing

321
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,579
couldn't be accepted

322
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,960
by most people at that time,

323
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,650
one day, it would be published

324
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,730
and loved by countless people.

325
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,130
Because in my dad's heart,

326
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,930
my dad really admired him.

327
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,930
I didn't mean to plagiarize Tianhuan's work.

328
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,660
I don't have his inspiration or talent.

329
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,350
When I first got his manuscripts,

330
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:22,930
you know what?

331
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,550
I really admired him.

332
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,490
Back then,

333
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,490
I submitted manuscripts time and time again

334
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,420
and was rejected over and over again.

335
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,940
It was really hard.

336
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,550
I took it as my motivation to inspire myself.

337
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,890
I read his manuscripts countless times

338
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,300
and kept thinking word by word.

339
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,920
His writing was like

340
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,900
a curse.

341
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,550
I couldn't sleep all night.

342
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,750
Eventually,

343
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,180
I couldn't stand it anymore.

344
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,420
I feel sorry to Tianhuan.

345
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,890
I know it's not good.

346
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,670
But when you tell one lie,

347
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,260
you need countless lies to patch up the lie.

348
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,430
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,770
I, Jiang Lu,

350
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,640
plagiarized the work

351
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,740
of my deceased friend, Bai Tianhuan.

352
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,750
I want to say

353
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,450
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,510
Uncle Jiang Lu admitted that he plagiarized

355
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,410
and publicly apologized.

356
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,410
He also returned what he took

357
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,290
from Uncle Zheng's safe box.

358
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,060
With my mother's permission,

359
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,510
the press decided to republish the novel

360
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,530
in the name of my dad.

361
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,950
You're Bai Tianhuan's son, Bai Ye?

362
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,140
Why didn't I know?

363
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,640
You always called him Maomao

364
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,250
and messed up his hair.

365
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,280
You treat people differently even at this age.

366
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,320
I can't imagine when you grow up.

367
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,250
You're almost 30.

368
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,820
You still treat me differently.

369
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,470
Come here.

370
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,840
Don't touch my hair.

371
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,540
Sui Yi.

372
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,700
Has the barrier upstairs disappeared?

373
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,150
Then I'm going to see An.

374
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,580
You found that lawyer

375
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,970
for Zheng, right?

376
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,010
You helped me solve the problem

377
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,200
given by Robin.

378
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,590
Not just that.

379
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,750
Zheng is also my friend.

380
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,030
Of course I need to help him.

381
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,320
And I saw that you were in a dilemma.

382
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,430
You didn't know what to do.

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,840
I wanted to help you too.

384
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,910
So I found

385
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,890
a good lawyer for Zheng.

386
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,700
That solved both problems.

387
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,590
That's why I did it.

388
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,060
But I don't think I was very helpful

389
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,400
on this matter.

390
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,280
Why?

391
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,930
They solved the problem themselves.

392
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,530
I didn't do anything.

393
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,710
Of course they have to solve their own problems.

394
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,530
What we did

395
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,210
is just to give them a push.

396
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,140
That's enough.

397
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,830
Everyone wants to solve their problems on their own.

398
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,670
I find that

399
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,860
you are better at saying

400
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,250
something that makes me feel warm.

401
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,000
Really?

402
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,680
Was I not like this before?

403
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,850
Although this problem

404
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,490
has been solved,

405
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,980
I was struggling during the whole process.

406
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,550
When I just found out

407
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,180
what Jiang Lu did,

408
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,670
it's really difficult for me

409
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,040
to stand in his shoes.

410
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,620
But as a lawyer,

411
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,620
I should take my client's side.

412
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,030
What should I do if I'm in this kind of situation again

413
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,870
in the future?

414
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,930
Do you want my opinions?

415
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,130
You can strike a balance.

416
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,260
Taking cases

417
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,840
is like receiving clients.

418
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,960
You can make a choice.

419
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,290
Choose your clients.

420
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,940
If you encounter a case

421
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,460
you really can't accept,

422
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,520
don't take it.

423
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,380
And don't make any comments.

424
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,120
Because in this world,

425
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,330
no one is absolutely good

426
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,670
or bad.

427
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,490
What you see may not be the truth.

428
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,680
But if you take this case,

429
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,720
you have to show your professional quality

430
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,270
and stand in your client's shoes to defend him.

431
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,260
But I need to be capable enough

432
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,000
to choose my clients.

433
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,860
I believe you have such potential.

434
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,650
You'll be able to do that.

435
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,490
Do you really think I'm suitable to be a lawyer?

436
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,420
Of course.

437
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,880
Whenever you talked about a court and defense,

438
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
your eyes would sparkle.

439
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,430
You're so gentle.

440
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,060
I can't

441
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,550
be an independent woman.

442
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,620
I just want to rely on you.

443
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,210
That's not contradictory.

444
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,670
I'm your boyfriend,

445
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
someone you should rely on.

446
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,760
Otherwise,

447
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,690
am I just eye candy?

448
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,580
I think

449
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,500
I should and must be capable enough

450
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
to solve all kinds of problems

451
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,380
in life and work,

452
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,190
instead of relying on my boyfriend.

453
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,150
But

454
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,450
when I was helpless,

455
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,300
you solved my problem.

456
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,790
I still feel delighted and happy.

457
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,030
Thank you.

458
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,750
You don't have to.

459
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,250
I have

460
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,310
information on that appraiser.

461
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
It might be useful to you.

462
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,010
Song,

463
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,510
I want more chili oil for my portion.

464
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,270
And more oyster sauce, sesame oil,

465
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,500
scallions, ginger and garlic.

466
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,170
Okay, got it.

467
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,640
Don't worry.

468
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,070
Thank you.

469
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,060
Put more in her portion.

470
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,950
Sister, I'm here.

471
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,760
The same as usual.

472
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,100
And a pig brain.

473
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,700
So you want medium hot skewers,

474
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,950
fried rice with eggs without scallions,

475
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,060
and a pig brain cooked longer.

476
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,000
I remember.

477
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,970
-Don't worry. -Thank you.

478
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,630
Cook longer.

479
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,210
Mr. He has stopped cooking for you recently?

480
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,090
I heard from Officer Chen that

481
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,300
Mr. He is a good cook.

482
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
How about you invite me

483
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,500
to your place someday so that I can taste some dishes cooked by him?

484
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,620
Sure, no problem.

485
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,170
But I found something.

486
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,620
Jia Xiaoguo.

487
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:13,850
Chen Xiaoyuan.

488
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,140
If Sui Yi changed her name to Sui Xiaoyi,

489
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,850
plus her idol, Su Xiaoyue,

490
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,390
you'll be the four divas.

491
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,920
What are you talking about?

492
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,930
Xiaoguo.

493
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,620
Here, it's done.

494
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,610
Okay.

495
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,550
Take care. Come often.

496
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,370
Are you going to eat three servings alone?

497
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,570
This is for two.

498
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,710
Are you going to eat two servings alone?

499
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:33,850
No.

500
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,430
This is for Xiaoyuan.

501
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,260
Song.

502
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,040
Let me ask you something.

503
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,500
Well,

504
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,090
how is Gu Nan doing recently?

505
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,220
What do you want to ask?

506
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,570
Nothing. I'm just asking.

507
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,970
He comes to work every day

508
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,020
and never asked for leave?

509
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,980
No.

510
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,020

513
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,530
I'm just showing my care on behalf of He Chufeng.

514
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,190
You're right.

515
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,980
Mr. He must have felt guilty

516
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,020
all these years.

517
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,500
Guilty of what?

518
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,220
Why?

519
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,300
It was Mr. He

520
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,260
who reported Gu Nan back then.

521
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,320
Are you saying He Chufeng

522
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,310
reported Gu Nan?

523
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:42,860
Yes.

524
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,990
When I heard about this,

525
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,530
I thought Mr. He

526
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,900
is a very righteous person.

527
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,910
And my admiration for him

528
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,900
was naturally born.

529
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,670

Very good.

531
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,850
I heard he could pick any locks.

532
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,650
He should be the most professional locksmith

533
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,520
in that area back then.

534
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,030
But

535
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,060
why did he lose his mind

536
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,120
to go astray

537
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,520
and steal from others?

538
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,660
That's a taboo of a locksmith.

539
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,140
He spent half a lifetime in jail.

540
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,390
I was wondering

541
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,240
why He Chufeng is so tolerant of him.

544
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,570
it caused a sensation.

545
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,160
Mr. He must be very helpless

546
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,160
with such a master.

547
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,720
It doesn't seem right no matter what he does.

548
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,190

so good?

That makes sense.

I'll ask him to write the follow-up story as soon as possible.

he's not a teenager anymore.

643
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,990
He has the right to choose whether to go or not,

right?

645
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,290
You think he doesn't want to defeat me?

646

By the way,

647
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,340
didn't he tell you

648
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,590
it was his idea

649
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,510
to have a competition with me?

650
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,550
I need to go to the bathroom.

651
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,180
Don't worry.

652
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
I know what to do.

653
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,800
I will let him have a competition with me

654

Very righteous.

659

He's not very flexible.

But sometimes he is just too righteous.

661

Yes.

00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,000
He is righteous.

663
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,840
Do you think it's good to be too righteous?

664
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,490
This is a strange world

If you want to be a righteous person,

670
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,300
you need to stay righteous for a lifetime.

671
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,760
Do you think it's possible?

672
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,010
If you want to ask me something,

673
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,820
just say it.

674

675
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,460
why He Chufeng reported you back then.

676
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,300
Aren't you his best friend?

677

Why don't you ask him yourself?

00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,110
Dismissed.

682
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,490
He Chufeng is my best friend.

683
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,350
I was 16 when I met him.

684
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,190
There should be no one knowing what he's

685
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,980
been through

686
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,160
better than me.

687
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,280
I'm the only one

688
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:51,880
who knows what happened to his family

689
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,900
and his little sister

690
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,490
and what he has been through.

691
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,940
These are like passwords

692
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,060
between me and him.

693
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,910
I keep these secrets for him.

694
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,880
But he has more secrets

695
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,850
that he doesn't want to tell the girl he likes

696
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,920
or his roommate.

697
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,830
What is he hiding?

698
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,600
What am I hiding?

699
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,640
I used to care about the truth the most.

700
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,050
Why did I tell terrible lies

701
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,820
to my best friend?

702
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,630
Hello, He Chufeng.

703
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,150
Who can answer this question?

704
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,650
There are eight long novels.

705
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,230
There are a total of

706
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,160
A88 permutations.

707
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,390
Either one of two novels

708
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,030
has C21A44 permutations.

An.

711
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:15,610
What are you eating?

712
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,720
The Rainbow oatmeal.

713
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:18,930
Sui Yi recommended it to me.

714
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,970
Why didn't she recommend it to me?

715
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,780
This is a chat topic between me and her.

716
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,200
There's no

717
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,010
white granulated sugar in it.

718
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,740
It won't make you gain weight.

719
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,880
It contains a lot of freeze-dried fruit.

720
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,870
It's super delicious.

721
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:24,410
What are you reading?

722
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,700
Bai Ye's novel.

723
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:26,650
Bai Ye?

724
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,500
Maomao.

725
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,110
He's only in Grade 2.

726
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,140
He can even write a novel.

727
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,300
Don't underestimate elementary school students.

728
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:34,780
What did he write?

729
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,230
Let me see.

730
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,550
Bai Ye specially told me

731
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,820
not to show it to you.

732
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,280
Why?

733
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,830
It seems he doesn't like you.

734
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,230
This Maomao.

735
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,190
You keep reading.

736
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,690
Tell me after you finish reading.

737
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:50,490
Don't talk.

738
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,300
It's going to be the climax part.

739
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:53,330
Go over there.
