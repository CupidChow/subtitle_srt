I really like her.

175
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,860
I want to be with her.

176
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,490
Isn't that good?

177
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,860
You two can live happily

178
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,100
for a long time.

179
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,130
I thought so.

180
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,980
But Olive...

181
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,620
She has changed.

182
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,300
She has changed

183
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,380
since we got engaged.

184
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,440
She never asked me

185
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,830
about the parallel world.

186
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,230
She doesn't drink coffee

187
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,610
or wear a high-collar sweater anymore.

188
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,520
She started to buy clothes she didn't like before.

189
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,900
I love her.

190
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,680
I know her.

191
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,760
She won't like these.

192
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,250
People change,

193
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
so are their habits.

194
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,470
Did you overthink?

195
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,290
No, definitely not.

196
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,150
A woman will doll herself up for the man who loves her.

197
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,140
Could she be dressing up for you?

198
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,480
No.

199
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
She has never worn it in front of me.

200
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,280
I don't like those things either.

201
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,690
I just like what she used to be.

202
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,150
She must be an alien.

203
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,680
She must be

204
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,500
an alien.

205
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,190
Mr. Luo,

206
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,300
could you please help me?

207
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,020
I beg you.

208
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,300
I'll pay you as much as you want.

209
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,620
Please help me.

210
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,510
Okay.

211
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,920
My partner and I

212
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,970
will figure it out for you.

213
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,020
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

214
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,850
You're welcome.

215
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,560
Thank you.

216
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,710
Mr. Luo.

217
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,960
Would you like black tea or green tea?

218
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,840
Either is okay.

219
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,380
Have a seat.

220
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:55,940
Here.

221
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,770
Thank you.

222
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,820
This one's for you.

223
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,840
Thank you.

224
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,500
Mr. Wang, it looks like

225
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,700
you pay attention to the quality of life.

226
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,120
Can you cook?

227
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,670
Yes.

228
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,380
I usually do the chores at home.

229
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,300
I also cook.

230
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,530
She likes to eat what I cook.

231
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,240
Not only breakfast and dinner,

232
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,490
I also cook lunch.

233
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,180
I cook it and put it in her thermos box.

234
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,020
She'll take it to the store.

235
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:19,810
The store?

236
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,600
She works at an art store

237
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,580
next to a primary school.

238
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,130
She's very busy everyday.

239
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,730
I thought about telling her to quit,

240
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,070
but she's just like me who can't sit back.

241
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,730
I think it's a good thing.

242
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,630
By the way,

243
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,130
I usually clean up the house.

244
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,790
She's busy at work.

245
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,180
I have to take good care of her.

246
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,020
This is my room.

247
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,330
Come in.

248
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,950
This is her room.

249
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,050
Thank you.

250
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,260
Okay, we're gonna go. See you.

251
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,820
Mr. Wang.

252
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,700
I forgot to ask.

253
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,710
What's Olive's real name?

254
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,290
Robin,

255
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,890
I'll send it to you later.

256
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,530
Weird.

257
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,670
The results of the investigation are out.

258
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,620
Come and take a look.

259
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,620
I have to go.

260
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,850
You're leaving?

261
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,500
Well,

262
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,730
what should I do if you leave?

263
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,490
I'm back.

264
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,260
No one is here?

265
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,300
Bean Bun,

266
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
are you the only one here?

267
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Miss, please enjoy.

268
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,520
Sir,

269
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,360
how many of you?

270
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,730
Two.

271
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,150
No, three.

272
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,540
Just two.

273
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,500
No.

274
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,470
Three. Three.

275
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,030
Okay.

276
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,060
Give me the menu.

277
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,580
Here.

278
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,370
Okay, let me take a look.

279
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,850
This is the signature dish.

280
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,080
I'll have this signature one.

281
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:29,720
Okay, thank you.

282
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,610
It'll be ready soon.

283
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,580
Hello.

284
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,830
Okay, thank you.

285
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,170
Third floor. Thank you.

286
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,940
Hurry up.

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,410
[Calling for help.]

288
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,410
[What's wrong?]

289
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,410
[Come and help! Robin sent a location.]

290
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,790
You knocked into me!

291
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,410
My ice cream!

292
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,620
Kid,

293
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,340
you knocked into me.

294
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,620
Madam,

295
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,660
you hit me.

296
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,840
You should compensate me for my ice cream.

297
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,660
Madam.

298
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,210
It makes me sound old.

299
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,960
Kid.

300
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,910
Madam.

301
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,270
You can't deny it.

302
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,450
You knocked into me.

303
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,770
You knocked into me.

304
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,650
Kid,

305
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,680
listen to me.

306
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,470
Here's the thing.

307
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,220
I was just walking from this way.

308
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
Were you here?

309
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,850
You were turning around like this.

310
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,760
After you turned around,

311
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,980
you threw your ice cream onto my dress.

312
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,800
Right?

313
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,280
-I didn't knock into you, right? -Madam.

314
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,400
My ice cream dropped.

315
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,290
Let me tell you again.

316
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,900
I didn't knock into you.

317
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,030
Is it good?

318
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,820
Yes.

319
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,510
You can have this too.

320
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,310
Thank you, Madam.

321
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,280
Thank you, Brother.

322
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,770
Why did he call you brother

323
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,580
but call me madam?

324
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,340
He's just a kid. He's innocent.

325
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,530
They usually tell the truth.

326
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,500
It's the opposite direction.

327
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,050
Over there.

328
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,300
Why are you following me?

329
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,140
Miss,

330
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,460
who are you?

331
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,060
You've been following me

332
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,830
from the elevator on the third floor

333
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,270
all the way to this restaurant.

334
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,620
I'm waiting for my friends.

335
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,950
They're late.

336
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,900
Friends?

337
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,990
Where are your friends?

338
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,050
Miss,

339
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,630
I'm really waiting for my friends.

340
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,340
They're just late.

341
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,560
Excuse me.

342
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,410
Sir.

343
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,960
Please enjoy.

344
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,160
This is the signature dish of this restaurant.

345
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
If you don't mind,

346
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,180
we can have it together.

347
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:52,930
Robin!

348
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:53,910
Here.

349
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,330
They are my friend and her boyfriend.

350
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,820
Boyfriend?

351
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,460
He's not my boyfriend.

352
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:04,900
Honey,

353
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,380
are you still angry?

354
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,260
Come here. Have a seat.

355
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,470
We had a fight.

356
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,290
Are you still angry?

357
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,060
I was wrong.

358
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,420
Fine.

359
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,020
Give me a red packet later.

360
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,430
Okay.

361
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,500
I'll put 520 bucks in it.

362
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,600
Is this the blind date

363
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,090
you're introducing to us?

364
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,010
No.

365
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,160
I got stood up today,

366
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,440
but luckily I met this lady.

367
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,210
If you don't mind,

368
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,750
would you like to

369
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,220
join us?

370
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,650
Otherwise, it would be too awkward

371
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,410
-for me to eat with a couple. -Thank you.

372
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,230
Excuse me.

373
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,220
Add a chair here please.

374
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,880
Okay.

375
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,590
Thank you.

376
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,450
You scared me.

377
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,260
You two did a good job.

378
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,010
Why were you guys so slow?

379
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,590
Couldn't you come earlier?

380
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,860
Who is she?

381
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,270
She's not your blind date?

382
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,830
Of course not.

383
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,970
Then why are we pretending to be a couple?

384
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,890
Or do you want to pretend to be a couple with me?

385
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,660
No, thanks.

386
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,260
Who on earth is she?

387
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,610
Besides,

388
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
why did you call us here?

389
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,260
It's on him.

390
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,630
Order whatever you want.

391
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,280
I see.

392
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,320
I'm hungry.

393
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,640
What happened just now?

394
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,790
It's all because you were late.

395
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,030
She thought I was following her.

396
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,260
Following again?

397
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:55,910
Miss.

398
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,920
This way please.

399
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,100
Be careful.

400
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,910
If you harass her, she may call the police.

401
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,580
This law intern,

402
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,620
mind your words.

403
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,180
If I had really harassed her,

404
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,100
why would I call you?

405
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,360
By the way,

406
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,250
is your dress hungry too?

407
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,850
That kid.

408
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,920
I need to use the bathroom.

409
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,410
So what's your conclusion?

410
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,190
She studied medicine.

411
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,730
She's very hygienic,

412
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,990
nearly mysophobic.

413
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,410
Every time after she tried on clothes,

414
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,060
she would wipe her hands with wet tissues.

415
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,280
She rarely touched any places germs lurk

416
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,980
in public.

417
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,700
Third floor, thank you.

418
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,900
Besides,

419
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,150
she used the knife in a way only a doctor would know

420
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,970
when eating steak.

421
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,380
Her nails are cut clean

422
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,040
without any decorations.

423
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,130
And the way she ties her belt

424
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,620
is a rare surgical knot.

425
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,860
But Mr. Wang never mentioned

426
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,740
she was a doctor

427
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,410
or she worked in the medical industry.

428
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,360
That's weird.

429
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,040
Robin!

430
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,680
I met your blind date

431
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,290
in the bathroom.

432
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,620
Which blind date?

433
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,500
The one we met earlier.

434
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,500
She's not my blind date.

435
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,970
But she's so weird.

436
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,410
She took off

437
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,460
all the good-looking clothes

438
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,490
and wiped off her lipstick.

439
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,850
And she washed her hands

440
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,150
like this.

441
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,150
I don't know how to wash my hands after watching that.

442
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,980
You're back.

443
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,000
You carry so many things.

444
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,950
Give them to me.

445
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,080
You must be hungry.

446
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,290
Dinner is ready.

447
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:18,980
Have some.

448
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,490
Have you eaten?

449
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,400
Yes.

450
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,700
Well,

451
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,920
are you tired?

452
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,390
Why don't you go to bed early?

453
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,790
Okay.

454
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,860
Does he know how to park?

455
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,690
Side park.

456
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,810
So this is why

457
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,980
he took an hour and a half to park that day.

458
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,440
Forget about him.

459
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,270
Let's go.

460
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,880
Am I parallel to the line?

461
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,010
Tell us if it looks good.

462
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,540
I didn't expect there would be something that Robin's bad at.

463
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,190
There are many things he's not good at.

464
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:04,900
But...

465
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,500
Is it okay if we don't wait for him?

466
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,610
He won't get lost.

467
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,430
It's okay.

468
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,130
Was he like this in high school?

469
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,550
He's always like this no matter what vehicle he parks.

470
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,090
Here we are.

471
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,130
Parallel?

472
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,210
No.

473
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,100
[Do you need help?]

474
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,100
[No, I can do it myself.]

at the main content for this semester.

♫I found you♫

That's even more unnecessary.

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,620
My name is Luo Bin.

♫We're not alone♫

Luo Binwang?

522
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,830
Not the same Luo.

523
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,860
Does it sound fancy?

524
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,000
♫We're not alone♫

He Chufeng?

529
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,910
We will meet no matter where we are.

♫I found you♫

531
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,660

♫I found you♫

537
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,550
We're going to study probability this semester.

538
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,380
Let's solve a problem now.

539
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,160
Who knows the answer?

540
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,060
♫In the darkest days♫

541
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,780
You didn't even preview on your vacation?

542
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,310
♫We've always been looking for a way ahead♫

He Chufeng.

544
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:53,000
♫Believing it will not be too late for love to come♫

545
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,630
1/35.

546
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,720
How did you calculate it?

547
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,540
There are eight long novels in total.

548
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,100
♫Take a breath, take a chance, and just take my hand♫

549
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,860
So there are A88 kinds of ways to combine them.

550
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,370
There are C21A44 kinds of ways

551
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,940
♫Nothing left to regret♫

552
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,670
to permutate

553
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,380
each one of both novels.

554
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,720
♫Or to forget♫

555
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,220
There are A44 kinds of ways

556
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,300
♫I found you♫

557
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,380
to permutate the other one.

558
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,690
So when aligning novels that meet the requirement

559
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,620
randomly in a row,

560
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,200
♫I found you♫

561
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,860
the probability of four books on the left being the same novel

562
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,260
is P equals to C21A44.

563
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,500
♫Someone new, something true♫

564
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,690
Divide A44 by A88,

565
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,260
♫Somewhere to get to♫

566
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,090
you will get 1/35.

567
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,780
♫This is proof, this is truth♫

568
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,400
So the answer is 1/35.

569
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,000
♫This is me and you♫

570

572
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,330

♫I found you♫

574

So...

575
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,540
We were talking about probability.

576
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,750
♫We're not alone♫

577
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,250
Probability is coincidence.

This probability...

I'm allergic to peanuts.

584
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,800
Peanuts are tasty.

585

Next time when you bring some snacks,

00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,060
can you bring something I can eat?

589
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,020
How about this?

590
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,720
Chips.

591
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,850
Okay. Chips are fine.

592
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,080
Do you want some chips?

593
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,790
Chips are good.

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,220
Fine.

595
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,860
It's good.

596
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:04,980
Here, have some.

597
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,330
Eat less.

598
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,350
Look at your belly.

599
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,410
Hold your breath.

600
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,220
I'm not fat.

601
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,250
Let's change another one.

602
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,530
Sure.

603
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,560
Brother.

604

Brother.

-Brother. -Careful.

607
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,810
Do you miss me?

608

Yes.

609
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,780
Eat fewer sweets.

610
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,860
Look at your teeth.

611
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,600
You've been so close since middle school.

612
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,810
It's rare, isn't it?

613
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,250
No.

614
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,320
He transferred to another school in the second year.

615
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,080
Mr. He,

616
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,090
when did you learn how to open locks?

617
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,770
When you were young?

618
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,360
When did you come to Zhaonuan?

619
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,760
When did you move to the vintage store?

620
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,420
By the way,

621
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,020
where's your sister?

622
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,300
You have a lot of questions.

623
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,950
You're also annoying.

624
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,960
Don't pry into other people's private stuff.

625
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,010
Fine.

626
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,860
Brother.

627
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:23,699
Chunian.

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,199
Yes.

630
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,630
Do you know I just...

631
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,190
I'm sorry.

632
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,730
I'll do it again.

633
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,090
Do you know what I just received?

634
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:54,699
What?

635
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,970
12.5GB.

636
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,480
I asked him about the name of his fiancee.

637
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,860
He gave me

638
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,400
12.5GB of data.

639
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,310
I didn't even prepare that much

640
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,320
for the FGA exam.

641
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,770
Is he deeply in love

642
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,130
or too serious?

643
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,560
Get to the point.

644
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,170
Do you know what Olive's real name is?

645
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,550
Li Yun.

646
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,220
There are more than five people

647
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,350
named Li Yun in our neighbourhood.

648
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,420
Think about it.

649
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,700
Why did a woman named Li Yun

650
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,740
would name herself

651
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,500
Olive?

652
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,970
Is the person she really likes

653
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,320
not Wang Wenxin

654
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,200
but Popeye?

655
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,970
You also have an English name Robin.

656
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,910
Seriously.

657
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,740
This is different.

658
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,910
What is this?

659
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,240
We've checked the handkerchief

660
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,390
you sent here last time.

661
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,100
It contains some hallucinogenic

662
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,400
which is psilocybin.

663
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,300
Psilocybin

664
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,060
is a kind of plant alkaloid

665
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,110
existing in psilocybin mushrooms.

666
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,770
Simply put,

667
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,110
this kind of mushroom can make people hallucinate,

668
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,540
which can cause misdirection to time and space.

669
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,370
Normally, it won't endanger life.

670
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,820
Psilocybin?

671
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,730
This person is so weird.

672
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,890
He's unpredictable.

673
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,590
Why the about-face?

674
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,240
I didn't ask too many questions.

675
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,420
I have many more questions at work.

676
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,710
Zhang asked me to play basketball tonight.

677
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,510
Will you go?

678
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,560
I can't.

679
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,280
You guys go.

680
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,150
What happened?

681
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,300
Why's the long face?

682
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,620
No, it isn't.

683
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,940
I'm busy. I'm so busy.

684
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,120
Mr. Zhou has been on a business trip recently.

685
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,430
I have a lot of work to do on my own.

686
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,930
I'm so stressed.

Sui Yi.

688
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,910
Are you ready?

689
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,560
Yes, Ms. Su.

690
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,290
Let's go.

691
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,080
Don't worry.

692
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,790
I can open it this time,

693
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,750
but I have a request.

694
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,110
Go ahead.

695
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,300
I can charge you nothing for opening the lock,

696
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,370
but I want to buy this magpie lock.

697
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,220
I don't know the price

698

of this lock.

699
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,500
If I ask for a high price,

700
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,470
I hope you wouldn't mind.

701
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,540
This lock is a fake

702
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,190
designed by modern craftsmanship.

703
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,080
It should be easy to appraise it.

704
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,770
Easy for you to say.

705
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,740
My dad bought it back.

706
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,280
It's got a story.

I don't know why

710
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,850
it keeps meowing.

711
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,610
Could it be hungry?

712
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,440
It's so small.

713
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,420
You even have food with you?

714
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,650
I put them in my bag.

715
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,860
There are many stray cats in our neighborhood.

716

Mimi, eat.

717
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,580
Eat.

718
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,410
It doesn't eat.

719
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,540
Is it scared?

720
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,480
Does it want to meet its mom?

721
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,690
Right.

722
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,220
How do you feel about

723
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:10,960
living with the two cutest guys

725
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,390
They seem a little weird.

726
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,550
Why?

727
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,910
My nose itches whenever I see them.

728
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,070
I always wanted to sneeze.

729
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't know what's wrong.

730
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,180
Sneeze?

731
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,090
This is a signal.

732
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,020
You have to pay attention to it.

733
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,780
What signal?

734
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,580
The signal is

735
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,690
you might be sick.

736
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,790
Did you catch a cold?

737
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,720
Do you have a fever?

738
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:35,970
No.

739
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,530
I'm healthy.

740
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,740
Then there's only one possibility.

741
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,120
It's destined.

742
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,860
You're just allergic,

743
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,280
or you have a cold.

744

The best way is to take some medicine

745
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,350
or see a doctor.

746
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,610
It could be destiny.

747
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,600
You have to believe in science.

748
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,020
Love can't be explained by science.

749
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:58,990
Listen.

750

Go back and observe.

or Robin?

753
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Well, I think

754
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,570
you should go back and observe.

755
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,420
Did He Chufeng catch a cold

756
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,320
or Robin catch a cold?

757
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,650
Maybe neither of them caught a cold.

758
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,530
This is a sign from God.

759
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,590
I just hope you don't catch a cold.

I'm off work.

764
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,060
Do you want to drink this?

765
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,840
I'll buy it for you.

Okay.

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,560
Take a look.

773
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,550
Seems I don't have anything to buy.

774
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,650
Me neither.

775

Okay.

Are you going on a blind date?

780
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,310
Don't listen to He Chufeng.

781
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,250
I'm just an innocent person

Besides,

00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,790
what's wrong with blind dates?

785
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,300
How many people

We don't relate to each other mentally.

What about those you are slightly interested in?

791

I believe in love at first sight.

If I don't feel anything when we first meet,

I'll never have feelings.

Then why do you keep going on blind dates?

It's my parents' order.
