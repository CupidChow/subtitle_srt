5
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,500
When I was a teenager,

6
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,259
I needed someone to tell me

7
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,259
how painful

8
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,780
for what I did wrong,

9
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,080
instead of the so-called protection.

10
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,180
Well,

11
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,060
did you call Chen Xiaoyuan?

12
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,570
I'll call her later

13
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,230
and ask her again.

14
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,010
What's wrong?

15
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,010
Did you have a quarrel?

16
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,500
Here you are.

17
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,930
They are sorted.

18
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,630
Throw them away please.

19
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,450
I'm taking out the trash.

20
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm taking out the trash.

21
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,520
See?

22
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,590
When people are in love, they'll have a lot on their mind.

23
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,920
Maybe this is love.

24
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,770
But the butterflies haven't flown long,

25
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,540
they've already started to quarrel.

26
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,260
Is that normal?

27
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,350
Maybe it's normal.

28
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,670
It's better not to break out when they're in the passionate relationship.

29
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,820
He Chufeng.

30
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,860
Oops, I used too much.

31
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,140
How fool is He Chusheng.

32
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,960
He's too straightforward.

33
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,900
Can't he be more straightforward?

34
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,910
Sui Yi

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,180
is quite stubborn.

36
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,060
I really think

37
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,370
I was born to worry about others.

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,500
It's really tough for me.

39
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,430
My palm wrinkles have increased.

40
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,140
But why did I

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,300
talk so much

42
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,040
in front of four trash cans.

43
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,740
I'm living.

44
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,300
Big Force has gone home.

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,380
Don't worry.

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,850
That's good. Good to know she's home.

47
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,840
Thank you, Yuan.

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,140
It's OK.

49
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,160
Rest early.

50
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,690
Good night.

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,660
Okay.

52
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,090
I admit I stole your stuff.

53
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,510
I know I was wrong.

54
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,660
A locksmith should be reliable, loyal

55
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,730
and trustworthy.

56
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,940
Honesty is essential.

57
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,980
Whether you meet people you know or strangers,

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,490
as long as they find a locksmith,

59
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,500
they'll give him trust.

60
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,529
Unlocking should not be a spur-of-the-moment decision.

61
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,550
If you decide to be a locksmith,

62
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,380
it will be your lifelong career.

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,590
But if

64
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,410
you just want to satisfy your curiosity

65
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,210
or to make more money,

66
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,280
I advise you to never get this job.

67
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,910
What happened to me just now?

68
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,740
I shouldn't have been angry.

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,840
Is she angry?

70
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,540
Forget it.

71
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,550
I can't pour fuel on the fire.

72
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,530
Did I do something wrong?

73
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,050
Why was he suddenly angry?

74
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,980
Why can a person's emotion

75
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,670
change so quickly?

76
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,460
Is it because...

77
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,170
No, no, no.

78
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,590
I owe him money?

79
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,510
That's why we couldn't

80
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,420
talk as equals.

81
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,700
Yes.

82
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,090
It must be like this.

83
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
That's why I didn't express myself strongly just now.

84
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,190
No way.

85
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,159
I have to work harder

86
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,080
and pay him back as soon as possible.

87
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,970
Firstly, turn it clockwise.

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,550
Twist the code dial for four times.

89
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,750
Align the 50th scale number with the scale line.

90
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,340
Then position the hypothetical positioning number

91
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,660
of the second round disc

92
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,070
at 88,

93
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,380
89, 90,

94
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,840
91 and 92.

95
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,480
Then position the hypothetical positioning number

96
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,340
of the third round disc

97
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,570
at 43, 44,

98
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,740
45, 46

99
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,780
and 47.

100
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,520
Now all the three hypothetical positioning numbers have been set.

101
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,920
Let's see how many combinations there are.

102
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,580
43, 88

103
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,020
and 43.

104
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,240
There are 125 combinations in total.

105
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,490
And then position

106
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,800
the combination numbers

107
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,860
on these three numbers, 0, 55 and 0.

108
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,180
Right?

109
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,860
All right.

110
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,360
I've taught you the method.

111
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,180
Let's practice the speed together.

112
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,150
I'll practice with you.

113
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,070
Start.

114
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,540
One minute and 58 seconds.

115
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,050
Done.

116
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,220
Prada's classic series.

117
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,170
It's a Saffiano.

118
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,860
Its metal tag is round.

119
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,040
The gilding is clear and strong.

120
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,440
Let me check its leather.

121
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,990
Although the patterns vary,

122
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,180
they are all rhombuses.

123
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,700
The leather is unified, clear and delicate.

124
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,450
It's authentic.

125
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,700
But the one you're holding

126
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,770
seems to be fake.

127
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,180
How is that possible?

128
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,080
My boyfriend

129
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,390
gave it to me as an anniversary gift.

130
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,600
It can't be fake.

131
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,870
Do you want me to check it for you?

132
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,630
Look.

133
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,570
The letter C on

134
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,620
the authentic one's logo

135
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,700
is round.

136
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,290
But this one is sharp.

137
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,640
And here.

138
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,610
The distance between the letters

139
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,430
should be the same.

140
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,370
But look here.

141
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,060
These two letters are too close to each other.

142
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,380
And the latter letters are too far apart.

143
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,690
Take a closer look.

144
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,430
What happened to your face?

145
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,540
Nothing.

146
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,380
I accidentally hit my face a few days ago.

147
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,780
I don't want to check it.

148
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,610
Just these two bags?

149
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,820
Yes.

150
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,670
You sell bags frequently lately.

151
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,130
What happened to you?

152
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,980
Nothing.

153
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,540
I don't like them anymore.

154
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,430
So I sold them out.

155
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,370
Is this price OK?

156
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,540
Okay.

157
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,020
Okay, I've transferred it to you.

158
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,730
Okay, thank you.

159
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm leaving.

160
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,670
Okay, take care.

161
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,760
Robin.

162
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:27,980
Well...

163
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,620
Could you lend me some money?

164
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,310
What happened?

165
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,060
Nothing.

166
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,130
I just have some financial problems recently.

167
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,650
I can write you an IOU.

168
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,940
I'll pay you back soon.

169
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,780
Okay.

170
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,070
How much do you want?

171
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,400
20,000, okay?

172
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,100
Sure. Wait.

173
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,920
Thank you.

174
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,980
Okay. I've transferred to you.

175
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,060
I'm leaving.

176
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,180
Come on.

177
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,240
Let me show you my latest discovery.

178
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,400
Meco juice tea.

179
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,540
It has four flavors.

180
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,500
One for each.

181
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
You will definitely fall in love with it.

182
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,060
Didn't you just say

183
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,950
to quit milk tea

184
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,820
and coffee?

185
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,900
You don't understand.

186
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,730
This juice tea has no preservatives.

187
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,510
And it's made of pure juice.

188
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,580
It's healthy.

189
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,930
And it tastes good.

190
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,520
It's really delicious.

191
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,620
This peach and grapefruit flavor is my favorite.

192
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,930
This cherry and berry flavor is also tasty.

193
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,080
I know you're stubborn in speech but soft-hearted.

194
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,350
I know you like it.

195
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,190
We girls

196
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,550
should drink more juice tea

197
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,740
and be good to ourselves.

198
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,940
Sui Yi, you too.

199
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,460
Buy some drinks to your colleagues.

200
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,350
It's important to get along well with them.

201
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,590
Yes.

202
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,370
They will like it.

203
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,220
It's healthier than other drinks

204
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,080
I can't save money this month.

205
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,230
Wait.

206
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,190
Why are you looking at me?

207
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,340
How did you know I was looking at you

208
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,380
if you didn't look at me?

209
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,420
Okay, I'm sorry.

210
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,130
Wait.

211
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,140
Can you lend me some money?

212
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,270
I'm short of money this month.

213
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,150
I need to take an exam for a certificate.

214
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,800
How much do you need?

215
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,340
Ten thousand.

216
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,650
It's been transferred.

217
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,660
Luckily, you don't have any hobbies to waste money.

218
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,460
Otherwise, I won't even have a loan shark to borrow money from.

219
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,020
Please control

220
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,810
your hobbies.

221
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,870
Maybe they can be controlled for a while.

222
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,270
My birthday is coming.

223
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,670
Come one,

224
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,290
your birthday is in summer.

225
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,740
As long as I want,

226
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,920
I can celebrate it anytime.

227
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,730
As long as you're happy.

228
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,700
Welcome.

229
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,460
Tell me if you need anything.

230
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,060
I have money now.

231
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:40,750
It's all I get.

232
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,310
Why didn't you sell this one?

233
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,030
I like this pretty much.

234
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,310
I don't want to sell it.

235
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,660
Silly girl.

236
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,350
Didn't I ask you to sell them all?

237
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,460
This amount of money is far from enough!

238
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,330
Second-hand bags

239
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,310
aren't worth much.

240
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,390
Your friend sells bags, doesn't he?

241
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,660
Tell him to offer a higher price.

242
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,860
Go to him tomorrow.

243
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,610
Ask him to offer a higher price.

244
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,340
Don't you know

245
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,880
how much this bag can sell?

246
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,210
Watch your mouth.

247
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,730
I did all this for you.

248
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,270
You know,

249
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,100
I'm working my ass off.

250
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,620
You're just selling a bag.

251
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,160
Why did I do that?

252
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,360
I did it to buy you cosmetics,

253
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:31,980
bags

254
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,730
and delicious food.

255
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,720
Right?

256
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,440
This bag

257
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
is a fake one.

258
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,700
You knew it was a fake bag,

259
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,780
but you asked me to sell it to my friend.

260
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,470
What do you mean, Fu Shuai?

261
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,940
Li,

262
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,320
you've changed.

263
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,060
How dare you talk back now?

264
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,460
You don't love me anymore?

265
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,700
No, no.

266
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,320
Of course I love you.

267
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,050
Love me?

268
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,150
OK.

269
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,710
Then kneel down.

270
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,550
Now!

271
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,140
On your kneels just on the street.

272
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,350
What are you talking about?

273
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,290
Are you crazy?

274
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,640
You love me, don't you?

275
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,500
You have to prove it to me.

276
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,500
What?

277
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,740
You don't even want to do this for me, do you?

278
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,230
However,

279
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,310
they need to experience this

280
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,420
on the present phase of their relationship.

281
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,030
It's okay for them to quarrel.

282
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,600
There's no need to be respectful all the time.

283
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,170
I told myself countless times

284
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,770
that you love me.

285
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,020
But what about you?

286
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,570
You don't have good appearance.

287
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,290
You don't have a decent job.

288
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,330
You have no perfect education background.

289
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,260
In this world, only I will love you,

290
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,370
and only I will be good to you.

291
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,180
But what about you?

292
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,940
Is it so hard to prove your love to me?

293
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,339
No.

294
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,079
I...

295
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,290
I'm willing to do it.

296
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,120
Go to the hospital if you're sick.

297
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,060
What are you doing here?

298
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,350
Kid,

299
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,730
I'm talking to my girlfriend.

300
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,290
It has nothing to do with you.

301
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,180
No normal guy

302
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,110
would make his girlfriend kneel in public!

303
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,410
Robin.

304
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,410
I'm fine.

305
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,460
I see.

306
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,880
Is this your friend who sells bags, right?

307
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,540
Now I know

308
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,970
why he didn't offer you a high price.

309
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,990
You're playing me around.

310
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,660
Li.

311
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,360
No.

312
00:17:59,290 --> 00:17:59,930
Kid.

313
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,270
Ask her

314
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,560
if I forced her

315
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,190
and whether she did it willingly.

316
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:06,960
Li.

317
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,690
Tell him!

318
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,180
I did it voluntarily.

319
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,030
No.

320
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,920
I just...

321
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,310
Robin, you misunderstood.

322
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,390
I just...

323
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,700
We were just kidding.

324
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,690
Did you hear that?

325
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,100
It's just a joke. Do you hear me?

326
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,940
My girlfriend is the best.

327
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,060
My girlfriend did it willingly.

328
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,330
Did you see this clearly?

329
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,900
She's my girlfriend.

330
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,060
Stay away from her.

331
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,260
Otherwise, she wouldn't sell her bags to you.

332
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,920
I...

333
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,980
Why did you hit me?

334
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,350
What are you doing?

335
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,960
Don't fight!

336
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,030
He's my friend.

337
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,100
Stop fighting!

338
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,540
Stop!

339
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,040
He's my boyfriend.

340
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,500
You'll injure him.

341
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,180
Stop!

342
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,980
Stop!

343
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,980
He's my boyfriend.

344
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,460
He won't hurt Robin.

345
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,710
Let go!

346
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,540
Why are you here?

347
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,140
Fu Shuai.

348
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,380
Let go! Let go!

349
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,370
Fu Shuai.

350
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,380
Fu Shuai.

351
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:14,930
OK.

352
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,580
-Fu Shuai. -Li.

353
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,470
Sorry

354
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,890
for causing you trouble today.

355
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,540
You don't have to say sorry.

356
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,640
He's not usually like this.

357
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,540
I don't know what's wrong with him today.

358
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,900
Sorry.

359
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,000
Did he hurt your face?

360
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:42,980
No.

361
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,540
I accidentally

362
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,640
hit it a few days ago.

363
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,530
Domestic violence once appeared,

364
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,360
it would be inevitable in the future.

365
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,420
No, it's really not made by him.

366
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,870
You misunderstood.

367
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,490
How could he hit me?

368
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,340
He's very nice to me.

369
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,340
He takes good care of me.

370
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,480
But he's been busy recently.

371
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,300
He has been under a lot of mental pressure.

372
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,260
That's why he was in bad temper just now.

373
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,530
No matter what the reason is,

374
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,620
hitting a woman is intolerable

375
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,020
for a man.

376
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,470
We will

377
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,160
get married soon.

378
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,700
He's in such a hurry

379
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,350
because he wanted to provide me a better life.

380
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,300
Getting married?

381
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,980
You should break up with him.

382
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,090
Why will you marry him?

383
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,200
My family condition is not good.

384
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,910
I have no good education background

385
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,730
and I'm not pretty.

386
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,240
And my job is not decent.

387
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,610
No.

388
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,780
Did he tell you these?

389
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,100
Be confident.

390
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,940
Why do yo bully yourself

391
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,980
every day?

392
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
I know you care about me.

393
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,880
No, Li.

394
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,490
Do you know what I'm talking about?

395
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,960
He even gave you a fake bag as a gift!

396
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,250
He...

397
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,850
may not know the bag is fake.

398
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,820
Besides,

399
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,240
it's not that important

400
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,840
the bag is real or not.

401
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,820
It's fine as long as I could feel his love.

402
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,530
Right?

403
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,120
I don't believe he has feelings for you.

404
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,130
I want to trust the person I like.

405
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,900
And I believe he will make me happy.

406
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,210
He really treats me well.

407
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,820
He takes good care of me.

408
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,870
Anyway, thank you.

409
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,620
I'm really sorry.

410
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,860
I...

411
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,160
What's wrong?

412
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,620
Well,

413
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,060
if it's possible,

414
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,700
can you

415
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,270
lend me some money?

416
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,180
What?

417
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,860
I just lent you money this morning.

418
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,580
What are you going to do?

419
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,420
Are you going to borrow money for that man again?

420
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,300
It's for myself.

421
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,420
It's really for myself.

422
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,750
I need money.

423
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,380
My parent is sick.

424
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,300
I don't have money now.

425
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,780
I have no choice

426
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,130
but to ask for your help.

427
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:20,940
I...

428
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,020
But I promise I'll pay you back soon.

429
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,710
OK?

430
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,030
I can only borrow this much.

431
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,590
I really can't

432
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,530
borrow more.

433
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,420
Silly girl.

434
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,300
What would you do

435
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,340
without me?

436
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,750
Look at you.

437
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,720
You can borrow a few thousand yuan easily.

438
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,940
Do you remember

439
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,100
you didn't have any friends

440
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,820
when you first came here from the countryside?

441
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,710
You couldn't even borrow a penny.

442
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,140
It's my fault.

443
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,750
It's not about whose fault it is.

444
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,020
It's about time.

445
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:52,580
We

446
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,860
need to experience this.

447
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,000
You just

448
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,980
need someone to encourage you.

449
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,060
Look.

450
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
If I hadn't said those things

451
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,800
in front of your friends,

452
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,420
how would you have the chance to borrow money from them?

453
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,420
Right?

454
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,390
You know,

455
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,460
my cheek hurts so much.

456
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,710
Are you okay?

457
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,450
I'm fine.

458
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,270
It's not a big deal to get hit for you.

459
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,220
It's my fault.

460
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,460
It's OK.

461
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,020
What I did was all for you.

462
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:15,830
And for our future.

463
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,540
Just smile.

464
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's go home for dinner.

465
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,570
He will make her cry again.

466
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,860
Look at you.

467
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,000
Since you're not good at fighting, why did't you try to win him in a wise way?

468
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,010
How?

469
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,980
There's only a stick beside you.

470
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,900
Didn't you see it?

471
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,250
Is this called wisdom?

472
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,050
That would be cheating.

473
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,250
Was it an exam or a fight?

474
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,060
A fight.

475
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,180
Can you help me with it?

476
00:24:59,210 --> 00:24:59,570
No.

477
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,590
No wonder Sui Yi is in a bad mood.

478
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,300
No wonder what?

479
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,970
No wonder Sui Yi is in a bad mood.

480
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,800
It's because you said something harsh to her.

481
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,460
I didn't.

482
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,560
You must pay attention to ways and means.

483
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,120
Be gentle.

484
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,100
Be friendly.

485
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,760
Don't always have that cold face

486
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,900
and talk so much about your principles.

487
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,400
Why do you have so many principles every day?

488
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,140
Do you think everyone is like you?

489
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,490
I have no money.

490
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,930
Hang in there.

491
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,020
You should restrain

492
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,140
your habit of lending money.

493
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,650
And I think

494
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,340
she didn't borrow money for her parents.

495
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,210
Besides,

496
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,110
I won't lend you money this time.

497
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,660
Be gentle.

498
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,620
Enough!

499
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,540
Be gentle?

500
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,530
Be friendly?

501
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,630
What should I do?

502
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,140
[Robin]

503
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,140
[Sui Yi, where have you been early in the morning?]

504
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:08,140
[Sui Xiaoyi]

505
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:08,140
[A good friend came to visit me. I'll be back late today.]

506
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,170
[Zheng Xingchuan]

507
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,220
[Good friend? Is she pretty?]

508
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,340
Sui Yisi.

509
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,460
Sir.

510
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,500
What's the matter?

511
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,170
What's wrong with me?

512
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,150
It's me.

513
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,080
Zheng Xingchuan!

514
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,810
Look at it yourself.

515
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,950
Who could recognize you?

516
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,950
I didn't expect to lose so much weight.

517
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,090
Your uniforms make you look handsome.

518
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,660
Not bad, right?

519
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,290
How about you?

520
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,340
How have you been?

521
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,320
I heard you're a lawyer now.

522
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,830
I'm just an intern.

523
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,020
Not an lawyer yet.

524
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,210
Apprentice lawyer is also a lawyer.

525
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:20,510
You are awesome too.

526
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,410
Our Sui Yisi has grown up.

527
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,620
Did you forget

528
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,740
you followed me around

529
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,620
and got beaten up by me when we were little?

530
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,700
Of course I remember.

531
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,410
What?

532
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,990
Now you still want to battle?

533
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,900
Fine. As you wish.

534
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,390
Right here.

535
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:36,770
Come on.

536
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,600
No, no, no.

537
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,160
If someone sees

538
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,780
I'm beaten by you,

539
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,100
I'll be embarrassed.

540
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,100
Look at you.

541
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,450
How can you

542
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,530
find a boyfriend like this?

543
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,640
Boyfriend?

544
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,500
I don't think it's the perfect time to think about it.

545
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,490
Right now,

546
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,300
I just want to get through my internship

547
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,290
and get my attorney's license.

548
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,180
By then,

549
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,380
I will be able to consider this question.

550
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,540
Judging from what you said,

551
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,300
you already have a target, right?

552
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,320
No.

553
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
You don't change at all.

554
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,310
You touch your hair whenever you lie.

555
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,000
Tell me about him.

556
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,340
I'm older than you,

557
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,860
I'll give you some advice.

558
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,510
Sui Yi went out early in the morning.

559
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,590
I don't know where she is going.

560
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,800
She didn't reply my WeChat messages.

561
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,610
There's some one...

562
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,630
I know.

563
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,180
He's a person.

564
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,790
We just met.

565
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,870
He saved me.

566
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,920
He saved you?

567
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,550
This man is extraordinary.

568
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,060
Maybe I'm the extraordinary one.

569
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,820
When we first met,

570
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,100
I knocked him down.

571
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,370
Then why you said he saved you?

572
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,900
That means

573
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,380
he is not bad.

574
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,150
He is kind.

575
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,700
But the present situation is a bit strange.

576
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,760
He treated me very well sometimes,

577
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,990
but he was indifferent to me other times.

578
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,540
This is called playing hard to get.

579
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,660
To catch me?

580
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,780
I don't think he's trying to catch me.

581
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,550
To pretend that he is less interested in me?

582
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,070
I don't think so.

583
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,090
Do you have feelings for him?

584
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,460
Yes.

585
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,680
I'm not sure.

586
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,250
Do you usually contact with each other?

587
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,610
We live together.

588
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,900
It's not the way you think.

589
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,100
We just rent apartments in the same building.

590
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,600
I live on the third floor and he lives on the second floor.

591
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:53,930
OK. I got it.

592
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,480
Do you want me to test him for you?

593
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,130
How?

594
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,080
What do you mean?

595
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,840
Red roses?

596
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,990
Do you like me?

597
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,210
I like someone else.

598
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,500
Stop joking.

599
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,300
We are always buddies.

600
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,150
You never see me as a girl.

601
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,210
Don't worry. It's not for you.

602
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,060
It's for the one you like.

603
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,180
Pass me your phone.

604
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,230
When you arrive home,

605
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,560
put the flowers where he can see

606
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,540
and post

607
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,100
this photo that is only visible to your roommates.

608
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,900
Remember to tell me

609
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,630
how he reacts.

610
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,260
I promise

611
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,640
you'll get him easily.

612
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:52,930
Really?

613
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,050
Put it somewhere he can see?

614
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,110
Where should I put it?

615
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,740
Here...

616
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,270
That's it. I'll put it here.

617
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,920
♫It's too low to express love with flowers♫

618
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,050
♫The dream promised to give you will break♫

619
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,880
♫Love is far more precious than it looks like♫

♫Girls, don't be shy and relax♫

622
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:04,920
What is it?

623
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,540
Who sent the flowers?

624
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,760
My dear Yisi.

625
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,900
No matter what you encountered...

626
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,930
My dear Yisi.

627
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,710
No matter what troubles and difficulties you faced,

628
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,550
you can come to me anytime.

629
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,320
I'm always willing to be your trash can

630
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,940
and always be by your side.

631
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,990
Heart.

632
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,170
Zheng Xingchuan.

633
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,330
It has nothing to do with me.

634
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,630
Also,

635
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,950
why are you taking other's stuff?

636
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,990
Is this the right time to talk about this?

637
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,570
You and Sui Yi...

638
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,910
No.

639
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,390
The friend she met today

640
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,450
is a man.

641
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,160
Let me see her Moments.

642
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,489
He's really handsome.

643
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,650
But compared to him,

644
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,040
I look a bit better.

645
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,290
The point is

646
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,230
he's wearing the Navy's uniform.

647
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,020
But I'm a locksmith.

648
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,820
Yes, you are a locksmith.

649
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,719
So the customs symbol matches you.

650
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,219
The one who came was with bad intentions.

651
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,920
What should you do?

652
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,940
♫Making noise alone and messing around alone. It's also good to be alone♫

662
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,020
No, thanks. I still have some left.

663
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:30,940
Thank you.

664
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,620
What do you want for dinner?

665

I'm not hungry yet.

694
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:46,760
Sui Yi.

695
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,310
Let me ask you a question.

696
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,580
Can you think about it for me in women's perspective?

697
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,730
Are you also short-sighted?

698
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:56,990
No.

699
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,570
This is part of my styling.

700
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,440
Go ahead.

701
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:03,800
A lady

702
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,340
who is about to get married,

703
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,550
but she suddenly loves to dress up.

704
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,670
Tell me why.

705
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,790
Maybe

706
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,930
she suddenly wanted to change herself.

707
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,930
Who did she change for?

708
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,280
Anyone is possible.

709
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,590
Maybe for herself

710
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,580
or her boyfriend.

711
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,910
Or maybe because of  what others said.

712
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,300
It's normal for women to love beauty.

713
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,980
But she didn't love beauty before.

714
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,860
She can love beauty now.

715
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,740
Is she seeing another man?

716
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,550
Maybe she wanted to wear those for her fiancé

717
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,120
before getting married.

718
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,980
Her husband doesn't think it's for him

719
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,510
because she didn't wear those clothes for him.

720
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,530
Her husband might have some problems too.

721
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,290
Do you think the probability of cheating is high?

722
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,940
There are countless reasons

723
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,180
that may cause a woman

724
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,280
suddenly started to dress herself up.

725
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,090
But you can't say a lady cheating

726
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,410
just because

727
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,260
she suddenly started to dress herself up before getting married.

728
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,660
This is to presuppose a result

729
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,530
and then derive the process backwards.

730
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,430
This is not precise.

731
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,230
Sui Yi.

732
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,760
We are just discussing.

733
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,710
You don't have to be so aggressive.

734
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,830
You have to admit that

735
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,670
there's still possibility for her to cheat.

736
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,890
I won't deny it.

737
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,810
But it may also because of

738
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,630
the good weather

739
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,300
or good mood,

740
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,540
she wanted to change her hair color,

741
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,440
buy new clothes

742
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,150
and have a feast to please herself.

743
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,700
In the current society,

744
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,540
this is much more likely to happen.

745
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,700
But in the current society

746
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,420
the probability of cheating is also high.

747
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,300
So,

748
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,060
you can't speculate on the causes of small probability events

749
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,680
based on the most probabilistic results.

750
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,330
But emotional problems are probability events.

751
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,610
There are only men and women in the world.

752
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,480
Times have changed.

753
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,070
We are humans first.

754
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,190
And then we are women and men.

755

Sui Yi.

756
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,170
Have you never been in a relationship?

757
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,560
If I haven't,

758
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,860
I won't be able to answer modern emotional questions?

759
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,520
I shouldn't have started this topic.

760
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,100
Why are you so sensitive about cheating?

761
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,740
You had an affair before?

762
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,500
Or you were cheated?

763
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,440
Really?

764
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,150
I shouldn't have tried to

765
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,140
understand your female thinking.

766
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,080
Then you can ask Mr. He.

767
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,810
His male thinking is scarier.

768
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,860
But my male thinking

769
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,720
can solve your relationship problems.

770
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,060
Forget it.

771
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,210
Your male thinking is different

772
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,890
from mine.

773
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,730
Why are there all banana milk?

774
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,490
You want the camp confrontation, right?

775
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:32,870
Robin,

776
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,460
If it's really your problem,

777
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,010
I can change my perspective

778
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,460
and analysis it for you one more time.

779
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:41,900
No need.

780
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,210
Your female thinking

781
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,600
is different from the one

782
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,420
in my understanding.

783
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:50,760
You...

784
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,930
really had a relationship problem?

785
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,820
Is your blind date successful?

786
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:56,900
Are you getting married?

787
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,170
Why are you so curious

788
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,930
about my relationship?

789
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,410
Do you like me?

790
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,090
I don't like you.

791
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,020
I'm just curious

792
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,490
about your relationship problems.

793
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,050
I'm also curious about your relationship too.

794
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,630
But I'm don't have any.

795
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,490
Are you curious about

796
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,810
He Chufeng's emotional problems?

797
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,970
Mr. He,

798
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,910
do you have any relationship problems?
