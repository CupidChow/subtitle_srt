00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,390
I've arranged everything in the store.

8
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,490
Roger is my friend.

9
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,630
He's reliable.

10
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,460
Don't worry.

11
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,570
If anything goes wrong,

12
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,090
please ask him to come to me directly.

13
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,229
I'll handle it.

14
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,700
Roger is your friend.

15
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,789
Of course I will trust him.

16
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,670
But Robin,

17
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,600
it there really no way to

18
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,280
reconcile you with Chufeng?

19
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,230
I don't know.

20
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,880
When people are impulsive,

21
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,190
they can't communicate peacefully.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,620
I know your temper.

23
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,770
There must be some misunderstandings

24
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,130
between you two.

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,920
I also want to explain to him.

26
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,720
I knew the truth.

27
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,340
I also knew He Chufeng

28
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,570
had been suffering because of this.

29
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,100
I know all of these.

30
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,390
But I could say nothing.

31
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,950
Hi, He Chufeng.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm Robin.

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,250
But my dad is Zhao Chengqiu.

34
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,480
He was the psychologist

35
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,900
who gave your sister with depression a fake certificate

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,230
so that she was unable to receive positive treatment.

37
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,640
And he's also the doctor

38
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,140
who led to your sister's suicide.

39
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,740
Or should I tell him

40
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,830
that although my dad

41
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,380
gave your sister a fake statement,

42
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,600
in fact, it's your father who forced him to do so?

43
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,290
Your father

44
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,380
is the real murderer who killed your sister.

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,860
What can I say?

46
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,540
What does he want to hear?

47
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,170
When I met him again,

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,980
I hesitated.

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,900
I thought about it countless times

50
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,460
whether I should contact him

51
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,270
to show my guilt for this matter.

52
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,940
But I dare not.

53
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,790
I didn't dare to contact him from the address book.

54
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,700
But then,

55
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,720
on that day.

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,720
I met him.

57
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,140
What a coincidence.

58
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,659
I just felt that it's the instruction from God.

59
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,420
I dare not face this problem.

60
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,430
So the God arranged this problem

61
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,590
in front of me.

62
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,220
I did everything I could

63
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,740
to make up for him

64
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,460
and to make up for this mistake.

65
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,450
I knew how painful he was

66
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,830
and how helpless he was.

67
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,490
I was afraid that he would give up his life

68
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,700
like his sister did.

69
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,700
So I asked him to rent with me.

70
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,220
I'd like to make up for him

71
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,130
and make up for this mistake on behalf of my father.

72
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,760
Maybe he knows it clearly.

73
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,250
But he's still angry now.

74
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,620
So he needs to calm down.

75
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,950
And both of you need time.

76
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,900
He thought I was just pitying him,

77
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,300
and feeling sorry for him.

78
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,460
At first,

79
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,960
I did sympathize with him a bit.

80
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,450
But after we got along,

81
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,900
I really take him as my brother,

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,010
my friend

83
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,730
and the person who grow up with me together.

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,510
When seeing his smile

85
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,490
and his love with Sui Yi,

86
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,060
I'm really happy for him.

87
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,940
Let it be.

88
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,370
We can't

89
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,140
be with each other forever.

90
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,650
But one day,

91
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,730
the one you're destined to meet

92
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,220
will meet again.

93
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,090
Yun.

94
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,090
I'll be right back.

95
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm back.

96
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,200
Wait for me.

97
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,040
Mr. He.

98
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,510
Long time no see.

99
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,210
How have you been?

100
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,730
How are you doing these days?

101
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,659
I'm fine.

102
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,170
My wife and I...

103
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,000
Li Yun.

104
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,270
Congratulations.

105
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,400
Thank you.

106
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,130
Mr. Luo often told me

107
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,340
not to think too much,

108
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,000
and I should do whatever I want.

109
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,610
Don't just stand there and wait.

110
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,340
I just took Yun

111
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,900
to see the aurora she wanted to see the most.

112
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,620
Where is Mr. Luo?

113
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,700
Didn't you be together?

114
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,060
He's busy today.

115
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,190
It's okay.

116
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,750
Next time I'll go to your shop

117
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,100
to express my gratitude next time.

118
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,020
Thanks to you.

119
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,640
Without you, we wouldn't be together.

120
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,490
You are our matchmakers.

121
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,100
Right?

122
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,260
You're welcome anytime.

123
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,010
OK. OK.

124
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,680
OK, Mr. He.

125
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,520
I'm leaving.

126
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,010
Yun is waiting for me.

127
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,330
See you, Mr. He.

128
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,860
Bye.

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,290
Bye.

130
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,470
My mom said

131
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,040
we must eat sweet dumplings on the Kitchen God's Day,

132
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,850
so that we can reunite in peace next year.

133
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,740
I bought this

134
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,180
at a far supermarket after work.

135
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,260
Eat them up.

136
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,680
But in some places,

137
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,050
people eat malt sugar on this day, right?

138
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,340
Malt sugar?

139
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,780
I've never eaten it before.

140
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,770
I'll buy it for you on the next Kitchen God's Day.

141
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,250
I'll do the dishes.

142
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,400
It's OK.

143
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,680
Let me do it.

144
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,660
Girls don't need to do the dishes.

145
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,240
Do you need my explanation?

146
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,100
No need.

147
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,330
Everyone has their own ideas.

148
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,070
So why bother asking the reason?

149
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,010
Did you see your dad at home?

150
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,370
Not yet.

151
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,250
Well,

152
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,080
are you used to staying at home?

153
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,740
Yes.

154
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,460
So,

155
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,980
how are you doing?

156
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,490
With whom?

157
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,810
Your fiancé.

158
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,370
This is my home.

159
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,550
It has nothing to do with him.

160
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,110
Besides,

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,770
who he is

162
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,320
has nothing to do with me.

163
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,980
You don't have to go back.

164
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,270
You can stay at Monster Vintage.

165
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,610
Don't worry. They won't say anything.

166
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,070
Without you,

167
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,910
I have no reason to be there.

168
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:20,970
What about you?

169
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,700
How's your life at home?

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,440
Yes.

171
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,490
Do you want to go to my house?

172
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,570
Sure.

173
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,390
Would you like some beer?

174
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,850
Sure.

175
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:02,860
Here you are.

176
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,020
You seem to be unhappy

177
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,040
lately.

178
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,410
Having a good friend

179
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,330
is a very lucky thing.

180
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,730
Not everyone has such good luck.

181
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,020
I don't know

182
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,310
what Robin is thinking.

183
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,880
I can't guess what he's thinking.

184
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm not defending him too.

185
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,230
Robin

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,670
seems carefree

187
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,740
and heartless,

188
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,670
but he's actually very sensitive

189
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,150
and meticulous.

190
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,680
He cares about your emotions.

191
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,370
He even cautiously deals with your emotions.

192
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,100
Sometimes after he joked with you,

193
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,610
he would ask me if you were unhappy when you left.

194
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,370
He asked me,

195
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,340
'Is he angry?"

196
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,960
As long as someone said anything bad about you,

197
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,550
he would be the first one

198
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,250
to stand up for you

199
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,310
and defend you.

200
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,690
Maybe the reason why you're angry is that

201
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,230
you think his kindness and care for you

202
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,880
is out of compensation and guilt for you.

203
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,170
But I think true feelings

204
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,180
can't be pretended.

205
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,910
If it wasn't true,

206
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,060
even if he could pretend for a while,

207
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,370
he couldn't be so persistent.

208
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,990
Will you leave me one day?

209
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,600
You want to chase me away?

210
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,190
I don't want you to leave.

211
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,630
But I don't want to bring you misfortune

212
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,060
because of me.

213
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,210
Meeting each other

214
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,460
is great for both of us.

215
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,250
No matter what problems we will face,

216
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,590
we can face

217
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,660
and solve them together.

218
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,850
I will always be by your side.

219
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,320
I won't leave you.

220
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,580
Come in.

221
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,110
It's cold outside.

222
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,760
Okay.

223
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,730
Make yourself at home.

224
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,430
It's only you and me at home.

225
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,100
The word "Sui Yi" is quite useful.

226
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,030
I miss her.

227
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,620
I'll get you some drinks.

228
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,130
This is all I have.

229
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:08,880
Okay?

230
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:11,840
Okay.

231
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,670
Do you want me to show you around?

232
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,040
But I'm not familiar with this house.

233
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,940
They all say this is my home.

234
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,450
But I don't remember

235
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,550
a lot of things about this house.

236
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,510
Sometimes when I wanted to find something, I had to search everywhere for it.

237
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,660
Look at that.

238
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,220
I don't know why

239
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,200
I put the printer in the kitchen,

240
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,700
and my coffee machine

241
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,830
is in the bathroom.

242
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,860
In this house,

243
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,660
I didn't find a photo

244
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,550
with my family.

245
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,820
This is a place

246
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,770
where only Fang Qi exists.

247
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,460
But I found a phone here.

248
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,130
This is it.

249
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,630
The family column

250
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,630
has never been lit.

251
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,580
I left and lost my memory.

252
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,290
No one came to find me.

253
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,120
I might used to be

254
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,020
a very annoying guy.

255
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,200
Robin.

256
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,610
You and Chufeng are different.

257
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,180
He and you care about each other.

258
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,100
You,

259
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,840
Chufeng and Sui Yi

260
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,420
are very enviable friends.

261
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,430
You'll make up.

262
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,340
I hope so.

263
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,690
As for that Cheng Wen,

264
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,840
it's so strange.

265
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,540
I don't like seeing him at all.

266
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,260
I didn't find any photos

267
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,270
with him in this house.

268
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,660
He sent me many messages.

269
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,619
I hardly replied.

270
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:11,770
Look.

271
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,050
I only replied to work messages.

272
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,829
I don't think Fang Qi loves him.

273
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,460
What do you want to do?

274
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,620
What should I do?

275
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,810
I don't remember who he is anyway.

276
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,170
I don't care who he is.

277
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,420
Whether it's Fang Qi who remembers everything,

278
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,740
or An who doesn't remember anything,

279
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,270
I won't marry him because I don't like him.

280
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,040
I just want to be with the person I love.

281

♫The breeze is brushing my weary face♫

[February in Spring]

300
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,750
I'm leaving.

301
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,490
You can make it, right?

302
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:28,990
Don't worry.

303
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,040
Remember to call me.

304
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,570
Remember to eat well.

305
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,050
It's not the first time I'm home alone.

306
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,620
It's different now.

307
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,380
I'll be back soon.

308
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,790
I have to go home during Chinese New Year.

309
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,430
Of course.

310
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,350
By the way,

311
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,740
remember to tell your mom

312
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,270
I bought that gift specifically for her.

313
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,760
Okay.

314
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,550
My mom must be very happy.

315
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,310
The bus is leaving.

316
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,210
Take a rest when you arrive at the shop.

317
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,090
I'm leaving.

318
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,350
Don't fall asleep on the bus.

319
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,450
Call me if you're bored.

320
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,380
I'll leave the shop to you.

321
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,050
Take good care of yourselves.

322
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,380
Don't worry.

323
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,880
I will.

324
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,030
When will Sui Yi come back?

325
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,290
She'll be back next week.

326
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,610
Okay.

327
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,970
With her around,

328
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,870
you two can take care of each other.

329
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,560
When will you come back?

330
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,350
I may not be back for the time being.

331
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,340
This is a promise between

332
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,740
Grandpa Mi and me 30 years ago.

333
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,570
I have many places to go.

334
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,090
and many things to do.

335
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,030
I think you know what I mean.

336
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,410
You're smart kids.

337
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,330
Just follow your heart.

338
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,780
Bye.

339
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,580
Let me see you off.

340
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,250
Mr. He,

341
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,230
have you contacted with your teacher lately?

342
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,350
Gu Nan, I mean.

343
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Did you have any contacts with him?

344
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:11,900
No.

345
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:12,740
What's wrong?

346
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,980
What happened to him?

347
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,410
A murder happened in our city.

348
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,380
According to the preliminary investigation

349
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,980
by the Criminal Investigation Team,

350
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,490
the deceased had a close relationship

351
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,650
with Gu Nan.

352
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,450
Of course.

353
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,860
This is just a preliminary investigation.

354
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,300
It only shows that they have contacted with each other before.

355
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,920
It doesn't mean anything further.

356
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,860
But what's suspicious now is that

357
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,520
we can't contact Gu Nan.

358
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,760
Mrs. Song said he left without saying goodbye.

359
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,980
He left without asking for his salary.

360
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,270
So I came to ask you

361
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,340
if he came to you.

362
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,300
The last time we met was five days ago.

363
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,320
We haven't been in touch since then.

364
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,220
What did he say that day?

365
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:56,900
What did he do?

366
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,870
Did he do anything unusual?

367
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,130
We challenged on unlocking.

368
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,860
He was

369
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
a little emotional.

370
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,770
Did he tell you

371
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,020
where to go

372
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,810
and what to do later?

373
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,380
No.

374
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,630
Okay.

375
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,170
Then I'll leave now.

376
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,460
If there are

377
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,900
any new clues or news,

378
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,410
let us know immediately.

379
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,250
You can tell Officer Chen.

380
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,140
Okay, I will.

381
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,570
Mr. He.

382
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:36,860
Well,

383
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,450
you know,

384
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,480
we all trust you.

385
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,500
So don't do anything bad,

386
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,400
OK?

387
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:52,850
Uncle.

388
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:56,870
Here.

389
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,660
Let's raise our glasses.

390
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,350
A new year has come.

391
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,130
Wish us a better new year.

392
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,440
Happy New Year, everyone.

393
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,470
Cheers.

394
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,180
Thank you, Uncle.

395
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,730
Hello.

396
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm having a meal.

397
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,570
Good timing.

398
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,370
Here, try this.

399
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,330
OK. I know.

400
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,260
I told you

401
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,020
the line in California is very important.

402
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,310
Keep an eye on it, okay?

403
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:39,500
Fine.

404
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,570
I'll fly over tomorrow.

405
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,930
Why haven't you contacted me lately?

406
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,080
I've been too busy lately.

407
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,900
I'm leaving for America tomorrow.

408
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,860
Do you know I went missing for a while?

409
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,590
Really?

410
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,130
But you've been back now, haven't you?

411
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,340
You really don't care about me at all.

412
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,900
Qi,

413
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:02,860
I...

414
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:05,940
Hello.

415
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,500
Listen.

416
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,780
I just told you

417
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,300
I'll come tomorrow, okay?

418
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,260
Tell them first, okay?

419
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,660
Uncle,

420
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,520
have some tea.

421
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,890
This tea is quite good.

422
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,210
It's the Dahongpao Tea of Mount Wuyi.

423
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,370
You have a good taste.

424
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,900
It's all thanks to you.

425
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,180
How are you doing with Qi?

426
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,720
We're fine.

427
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,460
The shipping line in California

428
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,780
is the most important thing for us now.

429
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,250
I'm worried about leaving it to an outsider.

430
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,700
After you two get married,

431
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,930
I'll let you take it over.

432
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,020
Uncle,

433
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,190
you overestimated me.

434
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,440
I'm afraid I can't

435
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,940
do it well.

436
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,980
Your family used to

437
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,220
run the art business well

438
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,500
in Canada.

439
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,370
You've lived there for so many years.

440
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,850
You know that place very well too.

441
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,010
No one is more suitable than you.

442
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,260
Uncle.

443
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,140
You're right.

444
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,780
But after all,

445
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,860
I'm still an outsider now.

446
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,250
Look.

447
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,220
I will urge her to get marry you soon.

448
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,140
Thank you, Uncle.

449
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,010
Happy New Year.

450
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,800
Come on.

451
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,530
Look at you.

452
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,900
Eat well and stop playing with your phone.

453
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:53,660
Put it down.

454
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,010
We're eating.

455
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,090
Stop playing.

456
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,310
We finally gather together.

457
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,540
You shouldn't have

458
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,550
bought him a phone.

459
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,500
Look.

460
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,820
He's almost in his phone.

461
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,200
I'm not a monster.

462
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,710
I can't get into the phone, OK?

463
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,690
Such a sweet talker.

464
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,420
Brother.

465
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,390
Help me.

466
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,010
He's just a kid.

467
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:15,980
It's okay.

468
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,620
You're so good to me.

469
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,330
Bin is the one who treats his brother best.

470
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,010
-Let's dig in. -Come on.

471
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,340
Thank you, Mom.

472
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,980
Oh, I almost forget these.

473
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,620
Here.

474
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,620
One for older brother.

475
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,180
And one for younger brother.

476
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,620
Be good, okay?

477
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,020
Yes.

478
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,990
Happy New Year.

479
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,900
You're one year older now.

480
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,360
It's your lucky money.

481
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,220
Take it.

482
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,180
No, thanks.

483
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,180
You don't need to give me.

484
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,980
It's for both of you.

485
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,900
I've worked.

486
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,770
No need, Uncle Lu.

487
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,300
Bin.

488
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,100
I can only take it back if your mom agrees.

489
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,070
Ask your mom.

490
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,580
Mom.

491
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,620
Take it.

492
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,330
You...

493
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,740
are our kid.

494
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,340
Not to mention now,

495
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,600
you'll still be our child

496
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,420
twenty or thirty years later.

497
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,020
Right?

498
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,860
Just take it.

499
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,920
We earn money for you,

500
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:01,740
you know?

501
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,090
Don't save money for us.

502
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,180
Bin, keep it.

503
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,100
Tomorrow, buy Lego

504
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,380
with your brother tomorrow

505
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,980
My dad gave me the lucky money.

506
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,830
How about you, Mom?

507
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,750
Give me another red envelope.

508
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,490
What else do you want?

509
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,580
The new year limited edition of Lego.

510
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,700
Take mine.

511
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,710
Thank you.

512
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,130

We're dating on the premise of marriage.

685
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,860
Let me say that.

686
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,680
You're a girl.

687
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,170

whom you keep calling every day, right?

697

Your phone screensaver  image is also her.

698
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,730
Of course it's good that they love each other.

699
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,230

Don't cry.

716
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,440
It's a good thing but you're crying like this.

717
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,610
Great.

718
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,460

Are you checking the household registration booklet?

Where's your hometown?
