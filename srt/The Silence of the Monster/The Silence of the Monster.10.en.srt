00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,170
What's wrong with you two today?

8
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,900
She didn't even look at you.

9
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,420
Did you do something again?

10
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,340
Let me ask you.

11
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,200
You like girls like Sui Yi, right?

12
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,900
We'll be in charge of

13
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,300
Mr. Dong Li's works.

14
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,530
I'll send you the relevant contract.

15
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,490
If there's no problem,

16
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,720
we can arrange the follow-up contract.

17
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:14,960
Let me tell you.

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,770
Sometimes,

19
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,090
you have to open up your eyes.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,900
Maybe you will find

21
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,700
the person you like likes you too.

22
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,210
Why are you so talkative today?

23
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,900
You talked about "like" all the time.

24
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,450
No.

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,940
I'm just a fox taming you.

26
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,360
Do you know

27
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,010
what kind of animal fox is most afraid of?

28
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,110
I don't know.

29
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,370
Olive! Olive!

30
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,690
Where's Olive?

31
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:28,730
No.

33
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,650
I used you.

34
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,780
When we first met here,

35
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,550
that was my saddest time.

36
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,520
Because of him?

37
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,260
No.

38
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,990
Back then,

39
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,910
I had a serious relationship.

40
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,090
But we broke up later.

41
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,380
I was really sad for a while.

42
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,460
Back then, I was too busy

43
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,240
in a hospital internship.

44
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,290
I gradually forgot.

45
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,180
One year later,

46
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,020
my teacher and I

47
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,120
got into a car accident on our way to the orphanage.

48
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,340
Then she went to another world.

49
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,020
You told me

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,700
there is a parallel world in this world.

51
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,010
I took advantage of you

52
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,740
and spent the hardest time with you.

53
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,190
Have you never liked me?

54
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,490
It doesn't matter anymore.

55
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,430
You are a very good

56
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,659
and simple person.

57
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,180
You should have a better life.

58
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,980
You should be with a better person.

59
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,370
Don't say that.

60
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,170
You can do whatever you want.

61
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,210
I'll accept any choice you make.

62
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,159
I'm ready.

63
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,770
Wang Wenxin.

64
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,450
You're a very special person.

65
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,230
Don't mind what others think.

66
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,310
Just be yourself.

67
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,850
Thank you for finding me

68
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,690
and letting me take this step

69
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,870
and start over.

70
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,310
Whether it's Li Yun,

71
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,160
or Olive,

72
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,770
it's all in the past.

73
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,700
I always wanted to

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,080
find my old self.

75
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,250
But later I found

76
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,790
I wanted to find the future me more.

77
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,190
He's a simple person.

78
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,060
I hope he can move forward.

79
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,050
Also,

80
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,720
I hope you can let go

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,730
and move forward.

82
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,570
Why are you crying again?

83
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,659
Are you from Mercury?

84
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,370
I'm not crying.

85
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,120
Mercury has no water either.

86
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,870
Why didn't you go after her?

87
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,030
I have no chance.

88
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,740
She doesn't love me at all.

89
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,750
This is the key to her room.

90
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,210
She always locks me outside.

91
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,180
The misunderstanding

92
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,130
between us is too much.

93
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,540
I don't know her well.

94
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,540
and I don't have a chance to know her.

95
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,050
This door

96
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,440
has never been locked.

97
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,620
It's not her who locked you outside.

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,850
but yourself.

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,560
Whether you want to open this door

100
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,770
is up to you.

101
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,350
Olive!

102
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,710
Olive!

103
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,920
Aliens are really bad at dating.

104
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,290
Olive!

105
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,620
Olive!

106
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,260
Li Yun.

107
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,230
There's a space exhibition tomorrow.

108
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,570
Can you go with me?

109
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,980
I want to know you.

110
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,160
I want to know you.

111
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,530
Come in.

112
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,710
I've talked to Mr. Jin.

113
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,550
He's very satisfied with the current progress.

114
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,100
Keep following up.

115
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,740
Thank you, Mr. Su.

116
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,720
I'll keep following up.

117
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,600
You did a good job this time.

118
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,310
Mr. He,

119
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,530
this is what you want.

120
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,270
Thank you.

121
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,170
How much is it? I'll give you the money.

122
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,420
No need.

123
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,080
Take it as a gift for you.

124
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,730
I hope you can make these mechanisms

125
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,290
permanent business secret.

126
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm just interested in this lock.

127
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,070
Thank you for the gift.

128
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,640
In terms of the history of this lock,

129
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,230
I only know

130
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Curator Meng bought it as a package

131
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,940
a few years ago.

132
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,950
He said the seller was a powerful locksmith.

133
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,470
Do you know his name?

134
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,220
I really don't know.

135
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
This is the will and diary

136
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,680
Mr. Dong Li left before he died.

137
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:19,930
Father,

138
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,410
I solved another problem for you.

139
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,350
How did you find me?

140
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,000
I asked.

141
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,310
You haven't eaten yet, right?

142
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,850
Try it.

143
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,430
Let me tell you.

144
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,560
I checked the photos.

145
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,460
I'm sure it's him.

146
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,230
I told you

147
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,460
in this era,

148
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,220
without an ID card,

149
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,100
it's not convenient to do anything.

150
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,980
I knew it.

151
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,690
He replaced a new one the day before yesterday.

152
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,210
Is it still facing north?

153
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,010
Yes, he used to be there.

154
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:04,960
Does he...

155
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,790
look okay?

156
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,360
He looks like before.

157
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,520
But his hair is a bit long.

158
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,570
Let me tell you.

159
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,930
If he wanted to show up,

160
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,250
he would earlier.

161
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,120
You know where he lives anyway.

162
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,670
Don't worry.

163
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,280
Isn't it good?

164
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,920
Boss.

165
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,810
One more bowl.

166
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,680
Okay.

167
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,260
In Zhaonuan,

168
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,820
if their shop claims to be the second,

169
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,030
no one dares to claim the first.

170
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,560
You have a seat because you came early.

171
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,210
Try it when it's meal time.

172
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,220
Do you see that?

173
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,130

Five minutes.

178
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,480
It only took three minutes.

179
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,890
But I'm afraid they think it's too easy.

180

No need.

Take a look at this lock.

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,640
I saw it with my own eyes.

I was a little flustered

and I didn't know how to express it.

223

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,870
I don’t mean anything else.

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,570
I'm not pitying you.

228
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,210
It's not sympathy.

229
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm just a little sad.

230

231

I couldn't find the right way.

235

My past is just my past.

It has nothing to do with you.

You have no responsibility.

So,

241
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,940
you don't have to feel sad

242
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,700
or sorry.

243

to be a burden between you and me.

But you don't have to force yourself to be friends.

Our client said he was very satisfied.

Ms. Su also said I did a good job

251
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,260
and asked me to keep following up.

252
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,380
You did a good job

about the Qianhe Art Museum.

254
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,180
You think so too?

255
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,500
But thanks to you guys,

256
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,530
I can do well.

257
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,040
Although many things have happened recently

258
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,640
and I'm a little stressed,

259
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,210
I'm happy

260
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm able to finish it this time.

Only Ms. Su.

263
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,210
You met her?

264
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,940
I'm half a female.

265
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,920
The rest are males.

266
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,550
Are you okay?

267
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,060
I'm fine.

268
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,110

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,500
Are there many female locksmiths?

270
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,280
Not many.

271
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,020
I know some.

272
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,110
Really?

273
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
It sounds so cool.

274
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,060
In most cases,

275
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,650
I can find the winning point.

276
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,000
But in cooking,

277
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,020
I really can't compete with He Chufeng.

278
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,940
You've found the winning point,

279
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,620
it doesn't mean you can win.

280
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,360
Sui Yi,

281
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,460
I let you in

282
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,700
because I want to create a situation of tripartite confrontation.

283
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,180
I didn't ask you to join him to dislike me.

284
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,420
I'm just practicing my speech

285
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,940
whenever I can.

286
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:49,920
And

287
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,870
the big boss who let me live here

288
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,900
is not you.

289
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,600
Stop imitating your leader.

290
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,400
You and her

291
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,860
are totally different.

292
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
You can tell that?

293
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,070
Of course.

294
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,540
Do you think I got so many certificates for nothing?

295
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,470
Looks like you've observed Ms. Su a lot.

296
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,340
What certificates do you have?

297
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
I have a jewelry certificate.

298
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,660
And...

299
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,590
What?

300
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,870
I lost the magpie lock.

301
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,340
That's true for now.

302
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,740
Are you sure it was in the pocket of the clothes?

303
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,540
I didn't take it out halfway.

304
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,600
I checked when I was shopping.

305
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,210
Could it be the one who hit me just now?

306
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,090
No.

307
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,860
What's wrong?

308
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,960
He's not in the right state.

309
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,630
He's too calm.

310
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,480
Have you located the target?

311
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,240
Target?

312
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:02,920
Who?

313
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,240
You know who stole it?

314
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Should we call the police?

315
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,300
Sui Yi,

316
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,700
have you noticed that

317
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,800
since you came,

318
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,340
we went to the police station more and more.

319
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,850
That's not what I meant.

320
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,400
He has no ill intentions.

321
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,980
How do you know?

322
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,180
Then...

323
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,770
how can we find the lock now?

324
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,540
Or,

325
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,140
how can we find this person?

326
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,850
She will show up herself.

327
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,700
Sorry.

328
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,540
What did you eat last night?

329
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,810
You haven't digested yet?

330
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,010
No.

331
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:47,810
No.

332
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,720
Here, have some water.

333
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,380
Press it.

334
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,960
Are you feeling better?

335
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,320
I think so.

336
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,540
No.

337
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,520
Well,

338
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,500
drink some water

339
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,310
and keep it in your mouth.

340
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,590
When you're about to burp,

341
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,690
do this and you'll be good.

342
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,350
Is this good?

343
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,100
Sui Yi.

344
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,500
did you secretly ate something

345
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,490
last night?

346
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,350
Tell me if you're not full.

347
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,930
Don't pretend you don't eat much.

348
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm full.

349
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,990
I didn't eat anything secretly at night.

350
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,470
So annoying.

351
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,100
Are you feeling better?

352
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,150
I think so.

353
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,070
Try pinching your nose

354
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,840
and breathe.

355
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,320
Are you done?

356
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,900
Come here.

357
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,580
Let me tell you how to do it.

358
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Come here.

359
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,530
What should we do?

360
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,720
It's okay.

361
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,150
I'm sorry.

362
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,940
A variety of shaped marbles are used in the lock cylinder.

363
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,820
There's multi-arrangement

364
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,890
and it created billions of

365
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,060
different key numbers,

366
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,360
thus achieving zero regional inter-opening.

367
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,900
What's wrong with you?

368
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,780
Impossible.

369
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,320
What are you thinking?

370
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,850
But

371
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,800
it seems quite tempting.

372
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,540
Miss Sui,

373
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,500
what are you talking about?

374
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,140
Are you okay?

375
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,620
No, I'm fine.

376
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,920
I want you to teach me how to unlock the lock.

377
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,310
Find someone else.

378
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,530
I can give you money.

379
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,660
This wallet is not yours.

380
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
Although it's not mine,

381
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,570
I picked it up.

382
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,400
No one wants it anyway.

383
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,530
I advise you

384
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,490
don't touch the money inside.

385
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,370
Why didn't you teach me to unlock the door?

386
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,490
They all said you're the best.

387
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,800
They said it wrong.

388
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,700
Still fighting?

389
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,780
Let's go.

390
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,380
Like me,

391
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,400
press your Neiguan acupoints.

392
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,500
Press it hard.

393
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,430
Are you done?

394
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,990
What's wrong with you?

395
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,330
What did you see today?

396
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,460
Nothing.

397
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,530
Okay, come on.

398
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,430
Lie down.

399
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,080
Relax your limbs.

400
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,440
Hold your breath.

401
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,820
Hold your breath for five or six seconds.

402
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,620
Breathe out slowly.

403
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,860
It should be fine

404
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,180
if you repeat this for a dozen times.

405
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:42,960
Inhale.

406
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,420
Five, four, three, two, one.

407
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,980
Exhale.

408
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,370
Inhale.

409
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,210
Five, four, three, two, one.

410
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,750
Exhale.

411
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,780
Inhale.

412
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,460
Five, four, three, two, one.

413
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,170
Exhale.

414
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:15,850
How is it?

415
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,470
Are you done?

416
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,900
Poor Sui Yi.

417
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,540
She is almost driven crazy by the burp.

418
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,610
What are you doing?

419
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,540
You hit me?

420
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,320
Why?

421
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,610
This is the only way.

422
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,310
Head-on!

423
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,180
Come on, hit me.

424
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,260
No, I dare not.

425
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,300
Just hit me.

426
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,900
What if there are

427
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,440
any complications then?

428
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,390
Hurry up.

429
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,940
I'm really coming.

430
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,460
Don't blame me.

431
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,050
I don't blame you.

432
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,180
Are you tickling me?

433
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,270
I can't do it. Find Bean Bun.

434
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,550
I...

435
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,660
Bean Bun.

436
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,100
Bean Bun.

437
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,130
Bean Bun.

438
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,620
I know.

439
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,560
It's too cold.
