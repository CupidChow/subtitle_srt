Miss Sui.

6
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,050
I remember now.

7
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,240
Today I'm very happy

8
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,180
to join the young talent project

9
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,940
of the Qianhe Art Museum.

10
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,259
And I'm really happy today

11
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,220
because I met my alumni in college,

12
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,700
Dong Li.

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,880
His sculptures are really great.

14
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,900
Sorry.

15
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,070
I made the decision first.

16
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:02,930
Mr. He,

17
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,470
what can I do for you?

18
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,000
I want to buy that magpie lock.

19
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,210
You mean the lock on the box of One & Only, right?

20
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,620
But I made it clear yesterday.

21
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,870
It's not up to me.

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,880
After all,

23
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,650
they belong to Mr. Dong Li's lover.

24
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,530
But Meng Ziyang said

25
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,050
the lock belongs to the Qianhe Art Museum.

26
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,160
Mr. He,

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,700
I'm just a nominal director now.

28
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,440
There are many things I don't know.

29
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,950
One & Only belongs to Dong Li's lover.

30
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,130
Meng Ziyang doesn't seem to know about this.

31
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,090
Mr. He.

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,890
That's all I know.

33
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,730
When the final work of Dong Li was about to be released,

34
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,500
Curator Meng Qianhe died of illness.

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,480
When did Dong Li die?

36
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,270
And why?

37
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,310
Where was he buried?

38
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,280
And

39
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,030
is One & Only really a fish bone?

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,740
Its box obviously doesn't match the fish bone.

41
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,290
What exactly was

42
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,070
in this box in the first place?

43
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,460
Mr. He,

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,100
what does this have to do with you?

45
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,470
As far as I know,

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,680
you're just a locksmith.

47
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,079
There is psilocybin on the lock.

48
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,050
Qianhe Art, the genuine fantasy.

49
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,940
This was the official marketing slogan

50
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,079
of your museum three years ago.

51
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,450
Psilocybin makes people hallucinate.

52
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,620
Did Curator Meng Qianhe really plan to

53
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,860
put Dong Li's body

54
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,530
in this box?

55
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,640
You saw it yourself.

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,540
They are all sculptures in it.

57
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,820
The curator

58
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,460
didn't do anything evil.

59
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,010
If you need anything,

60
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,300
just tell me.

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,040
I want to know the source of this lock.

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,880
Also,

63
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,740
I want to buy this lock.

64
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,470
I've only seen Dong Li twice.

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,830
Meng Qianhe,

66
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,580
I won't ask too much.

67
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
I just hope that after I die,

68
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,570
you can preserve my body

69
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,340
and give it to Li Yun.

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,050
It's win-win cooperation between us.

71
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,040
Li Zhe,

72
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,090
your idea is shocking enough.

73
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,409
We should think twice.

74
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,370
Considering your current condition,

75
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,860
you should go to a doctor.

76
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,820
I only have one month left.

77
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,370
I'm almost done with my remaining work.

78
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,220
I can give you half of my money.

79
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,900
But I will definitely not make

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,940
money that doesn't belong to me.

81
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,420
I'll reconsider your wish.

82
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,380
Take care of yourself first.

83
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,900
Meng Qianhe.

84
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,270

85
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,400

Let me drive you to the hospital.

88
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,520
Mr. Ji, thank you.

89
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,960
It's my pleasure.

90
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,090
The curator kept saying

91
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,700
Mr. Dong Li

92
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,380
is an important artist to our museum.

93
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,230
I've always admired your works.

94
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,750
Thank you.

95
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,980

You don't look well.

You really don't need to see a doctor?

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,940
I'm fine.

99
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,030
It's an old problem.

100
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,840
It can't be cured.

101
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,190
Mr. Ji,

102
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,060
I'll get off over there.

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,840
Okay.

104
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,160
Thank you.

[Zhaonuan Medical University]

106
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,640
Dong Li's real name is Li Zhe.

107
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,180
Why did he go to the medical university?

108
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,310
Wang Wenxin's fiancee, Li Yun,

109
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,460
also studied medicine.

110
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,950
Is there any connection between this?

111
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,700
The young talent project?

112
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,740
People really believe this.

113
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,370
This project was initiated by Mr. Meng Qianhe.

114

Mr. Liu,

115
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,980
aren't you part of this project?

116
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,610
Meng Qianhe.

117
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,290
Isn't he dead?

118
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,260
Do you know how he died?

119
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,190
He committed too many sins and got his punishment.

120
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:41,940
Let me tell you.

121
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,510
The whole project was a trap.

122
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,730
So much for cultivating young artists.

123
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,100
He just used the excuse of recruitment

124
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,570
to get other people's works

125
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,010
and then started to hype.

126
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,840
Those enticing stories

127
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,909
and gimmick news.

128
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,540
Do you know...

129
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,180
Do you know what he did to me

130
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,340
in order to raise the price?

131
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,480
He found a painter

132
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,200
and asked him to draw a similar painting of mine.

133
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,760
Then he started to hype,

134
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,680
accusing the painter of plagiarism.

135
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,050
He's so obssessed

136
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,130
with hyping.

137
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,900
You know what?

138
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,830
Now if you google Liu Zhengzheng,

139
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,860
you'll find my name is always followed by plagiarism.

140
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,180
But the problem is

141
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,710
he's the plagiarist,

142
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,230
not me.

143
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,800
That doesn't sound really good.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,720
Mr. Liu,

145
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,289
have you heard of

146
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,730
an artist named Dong Li?

147
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,800
Dong Li?

148
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,890
He's so famous.

149
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,290
Of course I know.

150
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,530
I heard that Mr. Liu is his alumni.

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,360
He's more famous than me.

152
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,050
Even a dropout is more famous than me.

153
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,520
A dropout?

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,070
Yes.

155
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,850
Li Zhe was a dropout.

156
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,800
Li Zhe?

157
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,780
Dong Li is Li Zhe.

158
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,400
He was admitted to our college

159
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,680
two years later than me.

160
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,780
But his works

161
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,580
are much more expensive than mine.

162
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,730
Now,

163
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,980
he should live a better life than me.

164
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,940
Mr. Dong Li passed away.

165
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,050
What?

166
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,910
When?

167
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,390
Two years ago.

Mr. Liu.

169
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,550
Do you know Mr. Dong Li's lover?

170
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,580
In college, Li Zhe had a girlfriend

171
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,020
studying in the medical university.

172
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,730
She got good grades.

173
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,330
Do you know her name?

174
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,510
No.

175
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,300
But I guess she studied surgery.

176
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,880
I remember he mentioned it before.

177
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,980
She seemed to be an intern of a hospital.

178
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,340
What?

179
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,900
Are you saying Dong Li's real name is Li Zhe?

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,790
It's too far-fetched

181
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,340
if you say Li Yun, also named Olive,

182
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,600
is related to

183
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,490
sculptor Dong Li.

184
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,670
You think they're related

185
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,660
just because of their surname.

186
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,420
It's only the superficial connection.

187
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,380
Don't forget that

188
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,170
Wang Wenxin works in the Qianhe Art Museum.

189
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,800
He met Li Yun in the museum.

190
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,950
And Dong Li,

191
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,960
that is Li Zhe,

192
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,180
was also an artist of the Qianhe Art Museum.

193
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,410
So you are saying

194
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,470
they're connected

195
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,840
because of the Qianhe Art Museum.

196
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:52,980
Not just that.

197
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,240
The connection between Li Zhe and the medical university

198
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,410
[Dong Li  Li Zhe]

199

[Olive Li Yun]

200
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,530
and Li Yun's medical experience

201
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,040
also seem to be the impossible inevitable

202
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,200
in small probability events.

203
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,420
When you have 100 conclusions

204
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,700
and all of them can't be verified,

205
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,840
the remaining one is the truth,

206
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,890
even if there is only a tiny probability.

207
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,520
What we need to do is to prove it.

208
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,510
Why do modern people

209
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,900
have so many names?

210
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,620
Aren't you the same?

211
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,250

212
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,060
and Robin.

213
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,330
Whether her name is

214
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,860
Olive or Li Yun,

215
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,070
it's just a name.

216
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,470
What we need to do

217
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,490
is to focus on her.

218
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,660
It's the people who are connected to the world,

219
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,030
not their names.

220
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,620
So you mean

221
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,180
there's something

222
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,220
between Li Zhe and Li Yun.

223
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,980
What's their relationship?

224
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,370
Siblings?

225
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,560
Friends? Lovers?

226
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,490
Do you think

227
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,410
Li Yun has changed

228
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,910
because of this?

229
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:48,990
Look.

230
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:54,870
It seems

231
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,720
you need to meet this person again.

232
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,090
[Li Yun]

233
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,300
If a person

234

switches between real and fake identities every day,

235
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,710
do you think that person could fail to switch the identity correctly?

236
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,490
Are you admitting that you're following me?

237
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,910
I'm just curious.

238
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,560
Why are you curious about me

239
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,930
instead of identifying things?

240
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,860
Did Wang Wenxin send you here?

241
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I knew it.

242
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,920
It seems that Mr. Wang

243
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,770
has no secrets in front of you.

244

Who doesn't have secrets?

245

there's something between us,

he should ask me himself.

If he could ask you himself,

249
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,630
you wouldn't see me here.

250

Why would a top graduate from a medical university

260

become a shop assistant

261

I wanted her to do scientific researches too.

298
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,580
But she chose to

299

follow Professor Jiang

If I remember correctly,

303
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,580
she was an intern in a hospital with Professor Jiang

304

when she's in her sixth academic year.

305

let alone Li Yun, who was there in person.

She left the university for a while.

310

It's really a pity.

Later I found out

314

Professor Jiang had been paying for her eductation.

315

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,020
I don't know the answer to this question.

343
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,070
Please teach me.

344
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,630
Give me a break. I'm so busy.

345
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,060
Read your book

346
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,760
and learn.

347
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,360
You might be able to do it soon.

348
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
This is the kid of a neighbor over there.

349
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,340
He usually lingers on this street.

350
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,380
Don't mind him.

351
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,980
Mr. He,

352
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,760
help yourself.

353
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,730
I'll go help in the kitchen.

354
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,440
Curly.

355
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,460
Curly?

356
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,540
That's vivid.

357
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,470
Inborn, I think.

358
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,100
Hello, sister.

359
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,940
Hello.

360
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,300
Brother Chufeng,

361
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,150
can you do it for me?

362
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,740
I can teach you.

363
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,120
But I can't do it for you.

364
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,150
Can't also means

365
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,850
denial.

366
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,490
It means it's definitely not.

367
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,040
All right.

368
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:24,910
Maomao.

369
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,730
What are you doing?

370
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,220
You still don't know the answers.

371
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,150
Come on.

372
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,580
Let Brother Robin teach you.

373
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,270
I can finish them in three minutes.

374
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,930
Uncle Luo Bing,

375
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,660
Brother Chufeng finished teaching in one minute.

376
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,440
Uncle Luo Bing?

377
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,290
Here.

378
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,530
Maomao, read after me.

379
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,460
Brother Robin.

380
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,320
Uncle Luo Bing.

381
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,660
Kids nowadays

382
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,180
don't behave like kids anymore.

383
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,020
Adults nowadays

384
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,460
don't behave like adults at all.

385
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,770
Thank you, Brother Chufeng.

386
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,290
Goodbye, Uncle Luo Bing.

387
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,190
He called me Uncle Luo Bing again.

388
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,540
This is definitely against me.

389
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,520
So annoying.

390
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,540
Is Sui Yi here?

391
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,180
Sui Yi.

392
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,410
Robin, you're here.

393
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,160
Do you need help?

394
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,080
It's OK.

395
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,900
Sui Yi, let me tell you.

396
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,070
The food offered at this restaurant is delicious.

397
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,610
Really?

398
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,430
You've helped me a lot lately.

399
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,530
In order to show my gratitude,

400
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,370
this meal is on me.

401
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,780
The Qianhe Art Museum will give up One & Only

402
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,060
only if we make Li Yun

403
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,270
admit she was Dong Li's lover.

404
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,590
Even if she admits,

405
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,390
we have no other ways if she won't accept it.

406
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,420
It'll be even worse if she accepts it but won't sell it.

407
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,460
What should we do?

408
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,210
Let's first finish the first step.

409
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,330
Yes, that's right.

410
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,890
Only in this way

411
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,380
can we save that poor

412
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,750
Wang Wenxin step by step.

413
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,780
I also want to give Mr. Jin a reply as soon as possible.

414
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm going to the orphanage tomorrow.

415
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,620
You guys are having dinner here.

416
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,940
You just get started?

417
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,490
Is this the new legal aid lawyer

418
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,140
in our community?

419
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,740
Hello.

420
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,420
Hello.

421
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,180
Why are you hanging out with these two idlers?

422
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,210
Come to my bookstore if you have time.

423
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,620
I'll give you a discount if you buy books.

424
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,020
Thank you.

425
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,540
Zheng, what are you doing here?

426
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,650
Right, I forgot.

427
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,410
Maomao.

428
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,430
Maomao.

429
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,250
Let's go.

430
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,150
Go home with me to do homework.

431
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,150
How can you focus on your homework

432
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,450
at this foul place?

433
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,990
You should stay at a place with literary atmosphere

434
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,070
so that you can finish your homework well.

435
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,960
This foul place

436
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,150
is not for a busy literary man

437
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,060
like you.

438
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,480
I'm here to pick him up, Song.

439
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,120
Let's go.

440
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,830
Give me that. Come on.

441
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,670
More.

442
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,430
I want asparagus lettuce.

443
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,590
Boss, I'll pay the bill.

444
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,630
Someone paid the bill.

445
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,860
The bill has been paid.

446
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
How much? I'll transfer it to you.

447
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,940
He Chufeng paid the bill.

448
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,180
You don't need to pay

449
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,850
when you are out with them.

450
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,330
Didn't we agree that it's on me?

451
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,180
You can come here next time.

452
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,650
You're the new one who moved to Granny Mi's place, right?

453
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,900
Come more frequently

454
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,000
and we'll know each other gradually.

455
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,860
I

456
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,890
like personalized girls like you.

457
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,680
Okay.

458
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,730
I'll come often.

459
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,690
You two.

460
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,900
Don't bully her.

461
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,370
Song,

462
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,220
you don't know

463
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,020
what she did to us

464
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,000
when we first met.

465
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,620
-Let me tell you. -Song.

466
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,660
We will come again.

467
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,340
Well...

468
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:37,650
Stop it.

469
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,900
You haven't finished your words.

470
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,530
Song, I'll tell you next time.

471
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,550
I'll wait for you.

472
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,220
Don'y say it.

473
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,610
I don't want everyone to know

474
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
that I knocked you down.

475
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,550
Me neither.

476
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,380
You're talking like I want the whole world to know it.

477
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,140
-You do. -You do.

478
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,940
I don't.

479
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,660
You do.

480
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
It's a weekend tomorrow.

481
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,950
I'll go to the orphanage with you.

482
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,490
Wake me up tomorrow morning.

483
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,620
Otherwise, I can't get up.

484
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,800
I've been very busy lately,

485
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,130
running around every day.

486
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,680
When should we set out tomorrow?

487
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,330
9 a.m.

488
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:07,970
No.

489
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,430
10 a.m.

490
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,070
8 a.m.

491
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,850
Why?

492
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,510
Let's reach a compromise.

493
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,260
9:30 a.m.

494
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,360
Shouldn't it be 9 a.m.?

495
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,340
Sui Yi,

496
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,990
did you study law to argue with me?

497
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,850
Do you want her to remain silent in the court?

498
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,140
Has she ever been in a court?

499
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,540
I have.

500
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,110
And I'm going to a court soon.

501
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,220
I'm sorting out the files.

502
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,770
You've improved.

503
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,960
Can I sit in?

504
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,060
Didn't you go upstairs?

505
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,700
I didn't.

506
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,810
Are you short of money?

507
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,510
I'll transfer some money to you.

508
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,920
Are you tired?

509
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,140
Go upstairs and rest.

510
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,300
Are you hungry?

511
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,340
I'll cook for you.

512
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,780
Are you short of money?

513
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,660
I'll make a transfer.

514
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,180
Eating more vegetables is good for your skin.

515
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,140
If you're really curious about me,

516
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,390
you can ask me directly.

517
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,520
I'm not curious.

518
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,880
I'm curious.

519
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,530
Well...

520
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,070
It's not about curiosity.

521
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,730
I just want you to live a better

522
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,220
and comfortable life.

523
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,580
We're getting married.

524
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,370
Don't you have anything to ask me?

525
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,520
Well...

526
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,920
It's a little late tonight.

527
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,110
Why don't we go to bed early?

528
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,490
Robin, get up.

529
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,140
We'll wait for you at the parking lot.

530
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,690
Why are you laughing?

531
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,480
It's good for our health.

532
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,830
My grandpa taught me that.

533
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,550
When you don't have time to run,

534
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,660
you can stretch your body like this.

535
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,780
Come here. I'll teach you.

536
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,870
Come on. Let's do it together.

537
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,480
Head.

538
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,820
Head.

539
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,290
One circle left and one circle right.

540
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,580
Okay, arms.

541
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:20,820
Another side.

542
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,500
I'm fine.

543
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,290
Is it that hard?

544
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,660
Another side.

545
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:40,780
Again.

546
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,810
Why didn't you wake me up?

547
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,570
I remember I set the alarm clock.

548
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,380
It's okay.

549
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,310
I'm exhausted.

550
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,340
I don't even have time to do my hair.

551
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,260
Gosh.

552
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,180
It's already 9:30 a.m.

553
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,010
It's only 9:30 a.m.

554
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,490
It's still early.

555
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,390
Let's go.

556
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,790
What's going on?

557
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,620
I have a driver's license.

558
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,460
I'll drive to the orphanage.

559
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,450
You drive when we come back.

560
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,300
When did you get a driver's license?

561
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,460
Why didn't I know it?

562
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,460
Gosh.

563
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,640
I forgot my drone.

564
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,130
Shut up.

565
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,790
The weather is really nice today.

566
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,440
I can't open it.

567
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,580
It seems that getting up early is useful.

568
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,660
Not bad.

569
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,290
Why are you looking at me?

570
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,040
Can't I show my feelings?

571
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,390
Now I understand

572
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,030
why you always say short words.

573
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,860
Sui Yi.

574
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,580
What did you say?

575
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,690
I said the weather is nice today.

576
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,640
The milk tastes good.

577
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,300
Yes.

578
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,340
It's rare for the three of us to come out.

579
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,940
Shall we take a photo together?

580
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,490
Let me take a photo of you two first.

581
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,740
Well...

582
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,030
Take a photo.

583
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,190
Let's just take one.

584
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,210
Take one before we leave, okay?

585
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,690
The street views are so beautiful,

586
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,400
right?

587
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,040
Li Yun has a more special situation.

588
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,130
Her hometown is not here.

589
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,780
Her parents abandoned her when she was born.

590
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,050
She was taken in by a local asylum

591
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,570
for a while.

592
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,930
After that,

593
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,370
she was adopted by a couple

594
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,080
who couldn't give birth

595
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,510
and was brought here.

596
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,900
It's said that in the first several years,

597
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,990
her foster parents treated her well.

598
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,580
So she's lived a good life for a few years.

599
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,300
But later, her foster mother suddenly got pregnant.

600
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,820
Hello, president.

601
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,740
Hello, uncle and sister.

602
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,180
Run slowly.

603
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,220
So her foster parents abandoned her.

604
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,930
Luckily,

605
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,210
she made a friend here.

606
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,140
Is his name Li Zhe?

607
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,470
Yes, Li Zhe.

608
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,650
They are Li Zhe and Li Yun.

609
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,550
This is Li Yun

610
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,280
and Professor Jiang who paid for her education.

611
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,470
But Li Zhe was not in good health.

612
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,110
He was abandoned when he was born

613
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,050
because of a heart problem.

614
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,560
Let's start.

615
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:02,860
This way.

616
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,210
Li Yun met Professor Jiang

617
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,700
and found what she wanted to do.

618
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,180
But she just gave up.

619
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,620
It's such a pity.

620
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,870
When accidents come too suddenly,

621
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,060
people choose to run away

622
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,460
when they can no longer bear it.

623
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,540
What's the point of running away?

624
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,920
The pain won't disappear.

625
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,440
What we should do is to face it.

626
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,500
It takes time to face it.

627
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,820
Maybe a month.

628
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,300
Maybe a year.

629
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,860
Maybe a whole lifetime.

630
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,300
Is it lonely to face it

631
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,080
alone?

632
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,100
There are many lonely people in this world.

633
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,810
Why don't they find someone to share it?

634
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,620
Because they haven't met each other yet.

635
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,030
You brought so many things back this time.

636
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,620
What do you think? Are they pretty?

637
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,420
Yes.

638
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,170
Look at this.

639
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,890
This brooch.

640
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,120
So beautiful.

641
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:30,980
Pretty.

642
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
That young man in your house

643
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,660
still hasn't come back yet?

644
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,660
Don't mind them.

645
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,730
They're grown-ups.

646
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,850
Are they together again?

647
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,770
Maybe.

648
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,170
I haven't seen them

649
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,650
since I came back.

650
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,230
Let me tell you.

651
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,710
I'm saying this for your good.

652
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,570
Is that locksmith reliable?

653
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,250
There are so many valuable things in your store.

654
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,010
What are you thinking about?

655
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,270
I don't know young people working as a craftsman

656
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,640
should be questioned nowadays.

657
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,140
Let me tell you.

658
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,140
Chufeng is righteous.

659
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,380
He's a decent man.

660
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,240
Don't gossip.

661
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,200
I won't.

662
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,360
Actually, I quite like that young man.

663
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,830
Otherwise, why would I want to introduce him to my daughter?

664
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,060
Well,

665
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,170
they should be an interesting couple.

666
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,260
Will they be a couple?

667
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,290
Why are you open-minded

668
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,080
all of a sudden?

669
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:46,880
Granny Mi is back.

670
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:47,920
Yes.

671
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,170
Auntie Liu is here too.

672
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,300
Granny Mi.

673
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:51,880
Hello, Auntie Liu.

674
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,340
We were talking about you,

675
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,520
and you came back.

676
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,740
What did you talk about?

677
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,940
Were you praising me secretly again?

678
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,020
Did you bring me a gift,

679
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:00,550

-Thank you, Granny. -You're so beautiful.

684
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,880
-Hello, auntie. -Chufeng.

685
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,800
Thank you, Granny.

686
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,590
This is for you.

687
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:09,590
Girl,

688
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,800
what's your name?

689
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,469
Thank you, Granny.

690
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,179
My name is Sui Yi. Auntie.

691
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,690
Sui Yi?

692
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,219
That's a good name.

693
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,370
Who gave you this name?

694
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,980
My grandpa.

695
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,929
I should have been named Sui Yisi.

696
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,340
But when my dad went for household registration,

697
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,139
he missed a character.

698
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,020
So my name is Sui Yi.

699
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,679
That's not bad.

700
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,310
Yes.

701
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,500
Sui Yi sounds much better than Sui Yisi.

702
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,210
Chufeng, did you hear that?

703
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,580
Sui Yi's original name is Sui Yisi.

704
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,929
You're so pretty.

705
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,860
This is a gift for you.

706
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,889
Thank you, Granny.

707
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,000
Sui Yi,

708
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,710
what do you do?

709
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,570
Aunt Liu.

710
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,620
I'm an intern lawyer

711
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,659
in a law firm.

712
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,989
Being a lawyer is good.

713
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,830
How old are you?

714
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,139
What's your Chinese zodiac animal?

715
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,070
What's your constellation?

716
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,409
Do you have a boyfriend?

717
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,500
Where do you live?

718
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,580
Look at you.

719
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,100
You scared her.

720
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,280
I just think this girl is pretty.

721
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,580
So I asked a few questions.

722
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,190
Sui Yi,

723
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,180

724
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,700
I'll introduce him to you.

725
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
In this room,

726
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,960
there are two handsome boys.

727
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,980
You have someone in your heart?

728
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,140
Chufeng or Robin?

729
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,590
Who do you like?

730
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,420
Auntie Liu.

731
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,100
Can't you care more about me?

732
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,210
Didn't your mom

733
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,530
introduce many girls to you?

734
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,890
None of them is suitable?

735
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,980
How do you know it?

736
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,310
