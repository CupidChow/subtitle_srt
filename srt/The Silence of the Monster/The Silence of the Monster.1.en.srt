Don't come out and play.

173
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,610
He's unreasonable.

174
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,640
We know you.

175
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,460
Calm down.

176
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,420
Who cheated?

177
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,400
You cheated!

178
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,330
Stop defending yourself.

179
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,340
Do you know how to play?

180
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,200
Of course I do.

181
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,210
Xiaoyue will give a performance tonight.

182
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,770
When can I get off work?

183
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,750
Hello.

184
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,940
Is this Su Xiaoyue's dressing room?

185
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,620
Yes.

186
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,540
Who are you?

187
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,380
I'm a fan of Xiaoyue.

188
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,660
I like Su Xiaoyue so much.

189
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,340
I want to take a photo with Xiaoyue.

190
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,860
Is it possible?

191
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,540
Get out.

192
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,940
This is a workplace.

193
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,300
Why are fans here?

194
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,690
Why are fans so bold nowadays?

195
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,430
They even came to the dressing room to take photos.

196
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,110
This is crazy.

197
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,620
How can Xiaoyue

198
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,220
take photos with them easily?

199
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,260
Right, Xiaoyue?

200
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,700
It's okay.

201
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,540
Get ready for the show.

202
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,910
The show is about to start.

203
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Go. Go. Go.

204
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,650
Let's go.

205
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,480
Xiaoyue.

206
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,920
This is a new phonecard and cellphone.

207
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,640
No one else knows it, right?

208
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,230
Don't worry.

209
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,780
I've sent you your new address

210
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,710
and password for the door.

211
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,660
Don't be angry.

212
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't mind what they did.

213
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,460
They're just jealous of you.

214
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,220
Fans are waiting for you

215
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,760
-outside. -Xiaoyue. Xiaoyue.

216
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm excited for you.

217
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,370
Xiaoyue. Xiaoyue.

218
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm excited for you.

219
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,230
Xiaoyue. Xiaoyue.

220
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,170
Xiaoyue!

221
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,240
Xiaoyue!

222
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,200
Xiaoyue!

223
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,950
The new girl group, Star Moon Girls, appeared this summer.

224
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,720
There are many topics about the popular idol Su Xiaoyue.

225
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
Since she debuted as a member of a girl group,

226
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,800
Su Xiaoyue has been attracting great attention.

227
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,590
She has many fans.

228
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,210
She loves stages

229
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,840
and continues shining.

230
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,140
Su Xiaoyue said

231
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:01,930
being herself

232
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,260
is her biggest motivation

233
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,130
on this stage.

234
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,630
Come on, Xiaoyue!

235

♫Rainbow shines under the bright sky♫

236

250
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,900
Hello?

251
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,730
Monster Key.

252
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,920
Please fill out the form.

253
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,640
Why?

254
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,730
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,430
This is the rule.

256
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,290
Show me your ID.

257
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,020
Why?

258
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,980
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,360
This is the rule of our industry.

260
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,290
If you don't show me your ID,

261
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,550
I can't help you.

262
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,780
Please take off your sunglasses and mask.

263
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,730
Can we start now?

264
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:58,920
Wait.

265
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,140
What I want is the most sophisticated,

266
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,060
state-of-the-art,

267
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,390
and secure electronic door lock.

268
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,010
It should be a high-tech lock

269
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,170
that no one can open.

270
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,310
What is this?

271
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,480
Many people trust electronic door locks

272
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,510
like you.

273
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,750
Should I

274
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,770
trust this primitive lock which is out-dated?

275
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,760
Miss Su,

276
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,260
your request is the most secure lock

277
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,710
that others can't undo.

278
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,800
Yes.

279
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,420
Electronic door locks are easy to be broken.

280
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,640
It was opened so soon.

281
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,820
The commonly used locks for doors on the market

282
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,860
are all smart locks.

283
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,000
As long as the signal affects the transformer

284
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,290
and destroy the password mechanism,

285
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,260
the lock core will be tricked.

286
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,310
No matter how complicated the lock core is,

287
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,540
it'll be easy to open it then.

288
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,990
So don't believe

289
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,030
new technology.

290
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,000
With regard to

291
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,490
Ms. Lin Huiying's civil lawsuit

292
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,330
against her son, Chen Silu,

293
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,260
through weeks of communication with Mr. Chen,

294
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
Ms. Lin was finally persuaded to give up the suit.

295
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,140
We're trying to let them settle out of court.

296
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,890
What do you think?

297
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,380
It happened again.

298
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,840
Sui Yi,

299
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,920
what do you think?

300
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,390
I've read the file on Ms. Lin Huiying.

301
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,240
Her life is a mess now.

302
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,100
She has no other

303
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,420
source of income to live on.

304
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,660
But if she insists on suing him,

305
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,180
she has a high probability of success

306
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,780
and can obtain coercion support

307
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,940
from the court.

308
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,460
But if she gives up

309
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
or withdraw the lawsuit,

310
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,860
at this stage,

311
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,580
she may not get a penny in alimony

312
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,740
and waste her time and energy.

313
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,700
This is the client's decision.

314
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,970
Accepting out-of-cout settlement during the appeal

315
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,060
is the decision made by the client

316
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,780
afte we showed her

317
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,620
all the possible terms.

318
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,320
The client has her own concerns.

319
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,720
Although you passed the bar exam at the first attempt,

320
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,180
you should know

321
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,620
as a lawyer,

322
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,700
if you just want

323
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,580
to increase the success rate of your case

324
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,780
by deliberately guiding the client to make a decision

325
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,530
regardless of her real will,

326
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,300
I think

327
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,050
this is very unprofessional behavior.

328
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,260
The fundamental reason that she sued

329
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,990
is because she can't make ends meet anymore.

330
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,270
If we only cares about her feelings

331
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,400
instead of solving her problem,

332
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,020
is this professional?

333
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,740
Also,

334
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,220
it has nothing to do with

335
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,460
whether I passed the bar exam

336
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,620
at the first attempt.

337
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,120
You two,

338
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,650
can you come to your senses?

339
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,970
What are you doing?

340
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,650
Please be aware of your position.

341
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,750
Who are you?

342
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,480
Apprentice lawyer.

343
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,270
Intern.

344
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,660
I asked you to attend the meeting

345
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,060
because I hope you can learn from it.

346
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,250
Don't overstep your bounds.

347
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,040
Either

348
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,670
listen carefully,

349
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,900
or

350
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,310
get out.

351
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,650
Let's continue the meeting.

352
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:27,820
Come in.

353
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,440
Please have a seat.

354
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,980
Please wait a moment.

355
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,220
Mr. Wang will be here soon.

356
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,240
Thank you.

357
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,450
I didn't expect

358
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,350
to come to Xiaoyue's company.

359
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,170
I wonder

360
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,980
if I can see Xiaoyue later.

361
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,760
Mr. Zhou,

362
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,600
at the meeting today,

363
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,420
I was not calm

364
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,980
and became emotional.

365
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,130
I will learn from my mistakes

366
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,210
and try to analyze cases objectively.

367
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,330
I won't be too emotional.

368
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,500
It's good that you realized that.

369
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,980
We're lawyers,

370
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,580
not psychologists.

371
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,580
The legal services we provide

372
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,340
should be neutral

373
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,880
and fair.

374
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:33,970
I see.

375
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,390
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

376
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,550
Well,

377
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,840
you can try to answer the questions

378
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,500
which this company will ask later.

379
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,370
Me?

380
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,500
First of all, the other party's action

381
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,140
violated the portrait right of our entertainer.

382
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,520
Based on the evidence we have,

383
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,940
the other party has made over eight million yuan

384
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,140
in illegal profits

385
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,380
by using our entertainer's portraits.

386
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,420
If we keep investigating,

387
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,030
the amount of money may increase.

388
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,580
While investigating

389
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,380
the first case,

390
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,490
we found the entertainer's reputation was also damaged.

391
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,890
This is ridiculous.

392
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,430
Cyberspace is not a lawless area.

393
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,500
We can change public opinion

394
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,450
through lawsuits.

395
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,330
We think both cases

396
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,550
can be sued for.

397
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,360
Therefore,

398
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,230
we also prepared two plans for litigation.

399
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,210
These are the two drafts of litigation.

400
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,050
Judging from the current situation,

401
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,740
we can begin to keep the evidence

402
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,770
from the following aspects.

403
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,460
I want to talk to you.

404
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,600
Xiaoyue.

405
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,440
I'll go out for a while.

406
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,660
Go on.

407
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,420
No, no, no.

408
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,060
Let me recall

409
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,570
what I was doing.

410
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,270
Was I too stupid?

411
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,770
Not really. I think I did all right.

412
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,470
I was saying,

413
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,080
"we can begin to keep the evidence

414
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,330
from the following aspects."

415
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:27,950
Right.

416
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,960
Then she walked in.

417
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,210
My daughter is so pretty.

418
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,590
Come to your senses.

419
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,350
I can't be sensible about this.

420
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,450
She's so pretty.

421
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,130
My daughter.

422
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,950
I can't believe I saw my daughter.

423
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,990
[The Real Hair of A Member of Star Moon Girls Su Xiaoyue]

424
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,990
[DM Me If You're Interested]

425
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,080
These people...

426
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:22,950
No, no.

427
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,860
For my daughter,

428
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,630
I must get a license to practice law.

429
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,700
[You'll be on camera tomorrow. Take good care of your skin tonight.]

430
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,110
[Okay.]

431
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,910
Who is it?

432
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,370
Who's outside?

433
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,260
Hello?

434
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,410
Monster Key.

435
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,490
The lock you installed for me was forced.

436
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,290
That's impossible.

437
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,360
But it was forced.

438
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,780
Where are you? I'll come to you.

439
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,780
Okay.

440
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,730
I'll see you at the intersection of the neighborhood.

441
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,180
Where are you going?

442
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,480
To pick someone up.

443
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,640
Pick someone up?

444
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,480
That's rare.

445
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,430
I want to go with you.

446
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,640
Why is it rare to pick someone up?

447
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,290
I need to record it.

448
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,870
Stop filming me.

449
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:36,850
No.

450
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,080
We agreed to record it.

451
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,500
Don't film me.

452
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,840
No.

453
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,360
Don't film me.

454
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,180
I'm using my own cellphone.

455
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,690
Then please don't film me with your cellphone.

456
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,540
Didn't we agree last time?

457
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,150
We have to record our life.

458
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,930
If you don't want to be scolded,

459
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,180
you'd better switch off your cellphone.

460
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,100
What's wrong?

461
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,430
Hello.

462
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,460
Let me take you to our shop.

463
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,380
Hello.

464
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,130
Hello.

465
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,780
Miss Su.

466
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,640
I know it's inconvenient for you to talk here.

467
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,800
Let's go to the shop.

468
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,920
Xiaoyue?

469
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,700
This cute lawyer...

470
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,260
I'm sorry.

471
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,780
You threw us to the ground

472
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,930
indiscriminately.

473
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,300
You're a special lawyer.

474
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,050
I thought

475
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,900
you were Xiaoyue's sasaeng fans.

476
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,920
Do we look like saeng fans?

477
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,100
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,060
I'll compensate you if you need anything.

479
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,040
You can solve your problem first.

480
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,850
The lock you installed for me was forced.

481
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,060
That's impossible.

482
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,490
But someone was in the room last night.

483
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,410
Someone must have come in.

484
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,220
I told you I wanted a secure electronic door lock.

485
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,090
You insisted on changing it to a normal lock.

486
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,200
It was forced easily.

487
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,450
There's no problem with my lock.

488
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,640
I live on the 46th floor.

489
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,500
If it wasn't for your lock,

490
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,880
could that person be Spider-Man

491
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,430
who can climb walls

492
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,270
and come in a room through a window?

493
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,160
That's possible.

494
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,820
Sir,

495
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,740
please answer

496
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,770
my client's question.

497
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,800
There's a security problem

498
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,350
with the lock you provided.

499
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,370
It affected my client's normal life.

500
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,310
Once we get proof

501
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,820
that there's a problem with your lock,

502
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,420
we can sue you anytime.

503
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,010
Don't infect others.

504
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,900
Thank you.

505
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,270
Don't always talk about suing others.

506
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,920
Problems are solved by people.

507
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,060
The most important thing now is to solve the problem.

508
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,560
Right?

509
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,240
Miss Su,

510
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,780
are you under a lot of pressure at work?

No, no, no.

No wonder you didn't allow me to record it.

That young lawyer

is definitely a fan of that idol.

Can you go over there

557

and have a chat with them?

558
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,860
Let me unlock it myself.

You're in my way.

560

You mean that young lawyer?

561
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,300
She doesn't look capable,

562
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,830
but she's really good at fighting.

563

How can entertainers open curtains at home?

What if the paparazzi take pictures of them?

582

It's such a tall building. How do they take pictures?

some fans can still take pictures if they want.

Why can't I see that room?

They asked for it.

The CCTV footage is only stored for seven days.

00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,760
He Chufeng is not here?

682
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,690
No.

683
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,630
In order to distinguish them from imitations,

684
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,750
Steiff Company sewed a button and a tag

685
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,070
on each bear's ears.

686
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,420
It's real.

687
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,880
Do you want to sell it?

688
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,660
I can give you a good price.

689
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,340
OK.

690
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,660
I'll give you 50% discount.

691
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,780
Can you let me

692
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,900
see He Chufeng?

693
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,300
Normally, the first step in authenticating

694
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,220
a Louis Vuitton handbag

695
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,820
is to check the label.

696
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,860
The typeface of "Louis Vuitton"

697
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,010
and "Made in France" on the label

698
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,480
should be relatively flat.

699
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,660
The typeface of "Paris" should be slightly thin and tall.

700
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,980
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,290
This is fake.

702
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,380
Don't tell anyone that it's fake.

703
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,430
Otherwise, I'll report you.

704
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,270
I'm exhausted.

705
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,840
