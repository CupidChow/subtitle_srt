5
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,410
Here you are.

6
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:45,970
Thank you.

7
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,229
I was really being foolish.

8
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,009
I drank too much that day.

9
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,960
I was going to take a taxi back to the place where I was living,

10
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,980
but I didn't expect that I would tell the driver

11
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,380
to go back to the old place.

12
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,020
I got here without thinking.

13
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,539
I was thinking that I had come here,

14
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,190
so I went upstairs.

15
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,480
Then why did you have the master key?

16
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,329
It was convenient to check houses, so I got one.

17
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,130
I had thought lawyers were rich.

18
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,380
I got inside and searched the entire house.

19
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,620
There was only 20 yuan.

20
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,450
So I put it back.

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,480
I thought I was already miserable.

22
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,070
I didn't expect the young lawyer to be poorer than me.

23
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,660
He pitied me?

24
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,200
What about the camera?

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,070
He took videos of me secretly.

26
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,770
Miss Sui, calm down.

27
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,420
Sit down.

28
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,520
Listen to me.

29
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,920
Under this circumstance,

30
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,930
he insists that he didn't do it.

31
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,860
We have investigated the relevant information,

32
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,540
including all his online and offline

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,420
purchase records.

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,579
Nothing is suspicious.

35
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,210
Who else could it be?

36
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,220
Kong is a middleman landlord.

37
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,220
You know that.

38
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,730
Before him, there was a principal landlord,

39
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,630
and some tenants with different backgrounds.

40
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,470
They are all suspicious.

41
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,880
This camera is connected to the Internet in real time.

42
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,150
We can start from the signal reception source, right?

43
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,580
Yes.

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,870
So we've filed a case.

45
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,780
We will conduct a comprehensive investigation according to the clues.

46
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,050
We won't let go of anything suspicious.

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,740
What will you do with Kong?

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,980
Miss Sui, you are a lawyer.

49
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,740
You should know that clearly.

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,540
But don't worry.

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,770
Give us some time.

52
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,270
We'll give you justice.

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,800
Thank you.

54
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,620
Chufeng.

55
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,640
Come out with me.

56
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,290
Are you okay?

57
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,640
When I find this pervert...

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,780
The configuration of this camera

59
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,610
is very special.

60
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,579
It's not like something which Kong

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,579
could easily get.

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,579
You know what to do.

63
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,180
I'll break his arms.

64
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,780
I'll also break his legs.

65
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,880
-Take good care of Miss Sui. -Okay.

66
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,480
I have to go.

67
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,760
But you need to calm down now.

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,800
Miss Sui,

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,700
I have something to do.

70
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm leaving now.

71
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,590
Thank you for today.

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,730
You're welcome.

73
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,460
Take a good rest when you go back.

74
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,350
Only after you rest well

75
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,910
can you solve the follow-up problems.

76
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,730
It has happened.

77
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,300
I will adjust my emotion.

78
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,130
Where are you going next?

79
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,460
You're a girl.

80
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,460
Don't run around.

81
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,120
If we don't settle you down,

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,260
we won't rest assured.

83
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,810
We still have some empty space in our shop.

84
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,570
If you don't mind,

85
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,880
you can move in here.

86
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920
No, no, no.

87
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,730
I have many friends in Zhaonuan.

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
I can live with my friends.

89
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,360
Don't worry.

90
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:39,970
Thank you.

91
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,330
This little lawyer is quite tough.

92
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,610
Are you leaving or not?

93
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,320
Sure. Let's go.

94
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,740
I can go with you.

95
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,610
No problem.

96
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,890
I mean why haven't you left yet.

97
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,980
Okay. Let's go.

98
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,670
I'm waiting for you to leave together.

99
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,220
I have no plans this afternoon.

100
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,600
I mean...

101
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,110
Didn't you say you were going on a blind date this afternoon?

102
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,650
What time is it now? It's too late to go on a blind date.

103
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,740
Besides, I don't have a blind date today.

104
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:32,880
You said

105
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,620
you would have a blind date today.

106
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,020
You are in such a hurry to send me away.

107
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,780
You're hiding something from me.

108
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,409
What? What are you doing?

109
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,890
I'm not leaving. Listen.

110
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:44,820
No.

111
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,740
Get into the car.

112
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,220
Why are you in such a hurry to send me away?

113
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,570
You...

114
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,050
Sir.

115
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,740
30 Square.

116
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,190
Okay.

117
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,409
Wait, sir. Don't set off now.

118
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,060
He Chufeng.

119
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,700
Explain it clearly.

120
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,430
Have a nice blind date.

121
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,220
Sir.

122
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,600
Drive slowly.

123
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,860
Wait, please don't set off now.

124
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,190
No, He Chufeng.

125
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,130
He Chufeng!

126
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,120
How come it's you?

127
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,320
I saw that you came back alone.

128
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,160
Thank goodness it's you.

129
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,440
Both of your ID cards are needed.

130
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,440
I live alone.

131
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,240
She lives alone. I don't live here.

132
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,720
Taking videos secretly also frequently occurs

133
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,460
in places like bathrooms and restrooms.

134
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,210
Like a fan, a toilet cover,

135
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,810
a roof light and the bottles of shower gel

136
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,120
and shampoo,

137
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,820
there may be cameras in these places.

138
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,060
It's okay.

139
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,770
You can turn on the lights.

140
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,540
For things like televisions, electronic alarms,

141
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,950
and weight scales which are not easily dismantled,

142
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,840
put your fingers on the screen.

143
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,740
If there's a camera

144
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,380
which keeps working,

145
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,400
your fingers will feel hot.

146
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,270
It's okay.

147
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,250
I've checked everything for you.

148
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,230
Just live here at ease.

149
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Thank you.

150
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,890
Thank you so much.

151
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,060
You're welcome.

152
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,130
Why are you helping me?

153
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,060
I'll help anyone.

154
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,290
Suit yourself.

155
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,240
By the way,

156
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,860
remember to lock the door.

157
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,570
♫Making noise alone and messing around alone. It's also good to be alone♫

158

160
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,020

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,510
longer than a year.

162
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,180
♫And I hate that I'm not brave enough♫

♫It was like the speed of a planet falling to the earth, which was so surprising♫

168
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,610

169
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,320
and scandals of new stars,

♫Maybe you won't show up on the day which I'm looking forward to♫

in front of our friends and colleagues,

176
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,230
and only telling our parents about good news instead of bad news.

♫I have to wait patiently for the shadows to go far away♫

178

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,950
and pretend that our life is stable and fulfilled.

180
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,660
But under the calm sea,

181
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,950
there are countless hidden reeves that can't be seen.

182
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,270
We struck the reeves, got drown,

183

called for help and struggled.

184

No one could hear it.

185
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,520
There has never been a wave on the surface of the sea.

186
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,580
The breakdown of adults

is silent.

188
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,450
If we're lucky enough to emerge from the water again,

we'll just hide our fear

there is some space in our shop,

and if she doesn't mind it,

she can move in.

so clearly?

263
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,020
It's okay for me to let

a girl live here.

265

as a roommate, you...

267
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,980
Have we finished discussing it?

Yes.

269
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,530
Take this downstairs for me.

270
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,410
Whether she will live here or not,

271
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,440
it feels comfortable to say it.

That's good.

273
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,860
Yesterday,

274
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,940
I introduced

275
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,420
how Mr. He Chufeng locked the shop.

276
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,190
As the manager, today, I'll

277
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,490
make an introduction about the antique shop Monster Vintage.

278
00:16:59,250 --> 00:16:59,800
First of all,

279
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,350
Granny Mi is the landlord and the boss

280
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,410
for all the people of our shop.

281
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,099
But she doesn't come often.

282
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,990
So I'm fully in charge of managing this shop.

283
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,099
What are you looking for?

284
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,140
The business license?

285
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,619
Look. It's over there.

286
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,380
We run this small shop legally,

287
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,410
and are law-abiding good citizens.

288
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,400
Although our shop is called an antique store,

289
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,210
but it can also be called a collection store.

290
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,150
Look here.

291
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,319
They're

292
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,630
Granny Mi's collections which she gathered

293
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,470
from all over the world.

294
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,650
Some of them are kept here by our customers for selling.

295
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,140
They are very expensive.

296
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,560
So be careful.

297
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,440
Don't touch them randomly.

298
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
You don't need to worry about the security.

299
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,180
I'm not bragging,

300
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,260
but He Chufeng

301
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,510
has made a lot of effort to provide adequate protection.

302
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,690
From top to bottom,

303
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,160
from the outside to the inside,

304
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,860
for every corner and every aspect,

305
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,010
he has considered about them all.

306
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,940
Since we joined this shop,

307
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,250
there has never been

308
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
any problem of security.

309
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,750
By the way,

310
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,610
here, too.

311
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,380
This is

312
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
where I work.

313
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,490
Although this desk looks plain,

314
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,430
as the most capable

315
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,770
appraiser in this city, I can tell you

316
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,290
Louis XIV's necklace,

317
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,580
the coins used for praying on the 25th year during the reign of Emperor Qianlong

318
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,300
and many other treasures that you can't imagine

319
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,890
once appeared on this desk.

320
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,720
Don't be surprised. Keep a low profile.

321
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,660
Keep a low profile.

322
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,710
This is the living room.

323
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
The kitchen is ahead.

324
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,370
It's equipped with a coffee machine, an oven,

325
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,930
and a soybean milk machine.

326
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,580
You can use whichever of them.

327
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,950
Don't be shy with them.

328
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,740
I dare not.

329
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,740
And here.

330
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,780
I forgot to introduce it.

331
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,270
This is our mascot Bean Bun.

332
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,110
It used to wander around the world.

333
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,380
Later, as it was reluctant to give up the delicious food

334
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,370
and was attracted my...

335
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,720
by Chufeng's charming personality,

336
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,100
it has stayed here till now.

337
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,530
Bean Bun's cat food and cat litter

338
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,630
are under the stairs.

339
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,860
Our rule is that

340
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,070
each of us is responsible for cleanning Bean Bun's poop for a week.

341
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,300
For the following week,

342
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,980
this task will be entrusted to you.

343
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,860
Robin.

344
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,100
I remember you lost the bet with Chufeng.

345
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,090
In that case, won't you need to clean the poop for a week?

346
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,490
Granny.

347
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,380
Let's go upstairs to take a look.

348
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,580
This is my room.

349
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,340
But it's not convenient to see it now.

350
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,630
This is Chufeng's studio

351
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,110
and his new bedroom.

352
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,810
From today on,

353
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,820
you don't have to worry about oversleeping,

354
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,980
because here we provide the morning call service.

355
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,130
That is...

356
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,530
Let's go.

357
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,020
Let's go somewhere else to take a look.

358
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,210
Sui Yi,

359
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
be careful

360
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,710
when you go up the stairs.

361
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,640
Because this house here

362
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,020
is very old.

363
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,180
And each of the paintings

364
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,220
has its own story.

365
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,020
This will be your new room from now on.

366
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,030
Later when Chufeng moves everything out of here,

367
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,200
this place will completely belong to you.

368
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,990
Thank you.

369
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,680
So this is your room.

370
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,440
Isn't it too troublesome?

371
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,350
Not at all.

372
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,710
We're very happy to have a tenant

373
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,020
to share the rent with us.

374
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,230
It's very convenient for me to live downstairs.

375
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,980
You can tidy things up here.

376
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,020
I'll go downstairs.

377
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,100
Granny.

378
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:13,970
This is

379
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,300
a rubber pillow I bought

380
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,220
in Thailand when I had a trip there.

381
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:17,930
It's new.

382
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,090
Look.

383
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,260
The color of the quilt cover

384
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,380
matches you well, doesn't it?

385
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,560
Granny.

386
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,620
You're so kind, and I feel flattered.

387
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,020
It's nothing.

388
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,170
A beautiful girl like you

389
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,780
should use some nice things.

390
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,930
It's necessary.

391
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,060
Granny,

392
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,500
I haven't even paid you the rent.

393
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,380
It's okay. It's okay.

394
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,380
No hurry.

395
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,860
You know what?

396
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,060
Actually,

397
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,810
I've longed for a girl to live in here

398
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,020
for a long time.

399
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,160
Otherwise, I would have to mess around with these two boys

400
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,590
at home every day.

401
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,690
It's annoying.

402
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,940
I'll go downstairs first.

403
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,490
Thank you, Granny.

404
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,260
[How's is it? Is everyhing going well?]

405
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,800
[Yes, I've tidied my things up. It's going well. Thank you, Yuan.]

406
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,040
[Rest early. See you tomorrow.]

407
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,060
[Okay.]

408
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,290
Well...

409
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,140
I'm here to look for the hair dryer.

410
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,410
It's inside.

411
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,660
What are you doing?

412
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,980
Are you wrestling?

413
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,590
I bet Sui Yi will win.

414
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,390
No.

415
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,020
I'm here to look for the hair dryer.

416
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,520
Sui Yi, look.

417
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,870
Su Xiaoyue is on the trending topic again.

418
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,380
A sasaeng fan is a sasaeng fan.

419
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,280
That's not a real fan at all.

420
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,110
Sasaeng fans, go away!

421
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,330
So disgusting!

422
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
Put the sasaeng fan into jail!

423
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,690
The public opinion has changed again.

424
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,780
If nothing changes on the Internet,

425
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,780
can it still be called Internet?

426
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,940
If I hadn't also encountered

427
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,320
something like this myself,

428
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,060
I wouldn't have been able to undestand

429
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,860
what happened to Xiaoyue,

430
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,340
and what kind of pain and fear

431
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,210
she experienced.

432
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,150
What about you?

433
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,000
Are you feeling better now?

434
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,330
Yes.

435
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,140
I have a place to live now.

436
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,260
I have food and work.

437
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,980
I feel content.

438
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,360
Although we've just met,

439
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,700
I hope you know that

440
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,500
I really appreacite your help

441
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,650
from the bottom of my heart.

442
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,370
There's no doubt about it.

443
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,560
But I think there's still another problem.

444
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,940
There are some things I want to ask in advance.

445
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,480
As men, you two rent the house together.

446
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,670
I'm a girl and now I'm moving in.

447
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,620
Well...

448
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,280
Don't worry.

449
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,680
We won't do anything to you.

450
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,440
He Chufeng has filed records at the Public Security Bureau.

451
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,290
The degree of safety here

452
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,440
is almost the same as the Public Security Bureau.

453
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,310
No, no, no.

454
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,080
That's not what I meant.

455
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,580
I just want to ask

456
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,340
whether there's anything I need to pay attention to.

457
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,810
For example,

458
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,690
will you bring girls here?

459
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,220
Is there any privacy

460
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,330
we should respect mutually?

461
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,280
If I want to bring my friends here,

462
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,470
should I report it in advance?

463
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,660
I work from Monday to Friday.

464
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,700
I usually stay at home on weekends.

465
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,990
Tell me if you need anything.

466
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,680
I'll try my best to hide upstairs.

467
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,940
I won't cause you any trouble.

468
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,060
I've found that your thinking mode

469
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,180
is really different from that of the ordinary people.

470
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,220
Am I that kind of person?

471
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,780
I don't know what kind of person you are.

472
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,890
He Chufeng will never bring a woman here.

473
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,370
Right, Mr. He?

474
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,370
Just wait till you

475
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,320
turn the woman in your blind date into your girlfriend,

476
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,710
and then you can make fun of me.

477
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm going back to my room to sleep.

478
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,010
[Su Xiaoyue]

479
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,240
I wonder how Xiaoyue is now.

480
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,620
Look.

481
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,700
The girl in the video is her.

482
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,610
She looks like an indecent woman.

483
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,840
She seems to be a lawyer.

484
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,310
Are lawyers so unscrupulous now?

485
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,940
For this kind of girl,

486
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,250
we should dox her

487
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,090
and expose her,

488
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,100
so that everyone around her

489
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,340
sees who she really is.

490
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,200
Morning.

491
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,130
Morning.

492
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,440
This is your cup.

493
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:28,950
Coffee.

494
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,080
Thank you.

495
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,010
Morning.

496
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,260
Vidoes taken secretly about a pure college girl's hot spring trip.

497
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,990
Why do you watch such erotic videos in the morning?

498
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
It's my friend.

499
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,310
She said those videos

500
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,150
might be sold on these websites.

501
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
So you try to find them from these websites

502
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,290
one by one?

503
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,530
I have to try anyway.

504
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,310
Eat first.

505
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,230
He'll look for them.

506
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,890
No. What do you mean?

507
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,140
Are you asking me to watch them?

508
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,450
It's okay. I can look for them myself.

509
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,650
You eat. He'll look for them.

510
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,710
I also need to eat.

511
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,820
I can't watch

512
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,940
such erotic videos early in the morning.

513
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:31,940
It's okay.

514
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,050
You should eat, too.

515
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,340
You need to eat to gain strength.

516
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:51,660
Thank you.

517
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,970
So,

518
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,060
does he read newspapers every morning?

519
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,910
Do you want to read it?

520
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,740
Okay.

521
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,070
Let me see what is the news on it.

522
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,820
Did you sleep well last night?

523
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,840
I can get used to a new bed easily.

524
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,040
I slept well.

525
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,330
He

526
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,030
even writes letters.

527
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,600
Hello?

528
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,550
Got it.

529
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:23,960
It's early in the morning.

530
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:24,890
Come on.

531
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,250
Watch them.

532
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,740
Sui Yi.

533
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,830
How many did she find?

534
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,370
Gosh. This kind of...

535
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,580
I think after today,

536
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,300
I can bid farewell to the earthly life,

537
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,600
and become a Buddhist.

538
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,250
Hello.

539
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:14,910
Miss Sui.

540
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,610
Do you know this gentleman?

541
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,310
No.

542
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,550
He is your principal landlord.

543
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,390
Miss Sui Yi.

544
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,570
I'm really sorry

545
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,350
for making you go through this.

546
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,930
I mismanaged the house.

547
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:41,670
Of course,

548
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,500
I'll do my best to assist in the police's

549
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,580
investigation on this case.

550
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,940
We must punish these villains severely.

551
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,160
Miss Sui,

552
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,620
do you think this is okay?

553
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,400
Sir.

554
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,400
Follow that Toyota car.

555
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,700
Why are you here?

556
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,880
Gastroscopist?

557
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,030
Have you heard of the gastroscopy capsule used for

558
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:49,840
gastroscope in the hospital?

559
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,110
The camera in this capsule has the same specs

560
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,810
as the one at your home.

561
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,130
I didn't expect

562
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,630
you are still running around to handle this for me.

563
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,630
Thank you so much.

564
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,530
Not at all.

565
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,760
We are roommates.

566
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,990
We should help each other.

567
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,780
But we don't have enough evidence now.

568
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,410
Otherwise, the police

569
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,950
wouldn't have let him go easily.

570
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:18,950
Let's start from the signal source.

571
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,520
The Internet has memories.

572
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,380
If he did such a thing,

573
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,180
we can definitely find him.

574
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,170
The shell of this capsule

575
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,560
is made of biocompatibility materials

576
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,410
It's very safe.

577
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,820
It will be excreted from the body with the excrement next day.

578
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,790
Don't worry.

579
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,010
You two made a lot of effort,

580
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,960
and came here for that girl, right?

581
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,770
I explained it clearly to the police.

582
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,030
I sympathize with her.

583
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,900
At the same time, I also hope that

584
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,990
she can get out of the shadow as soon as possible.

585
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,640
It's done.

586
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,760
Nothing serious.

587
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,040
You just have superficial gastritis.

588
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,699
Your stomach reflects your mental pressure.

589
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,000
So I suggest

590
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,810
not to think too much.

591
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,929
When you handle a thing,

592
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,810
don't get to the bottom of it.

593
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,850
If you dig too deep,

594
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,610
you might fall into the hole easily.

595
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,080
When you handle a thing, don't get to the bottom of it.

596
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,510
If you dig too deep,

597
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,739
you might fall into the hole easily.

598
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,699
Did you see his face?

599
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,699
And the way he talked to me.

600
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,980
Isn't he a pervert?

601
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,679
I must catch this pervert

602
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:47,780
and get to the bottom of it.

603
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:48,929
Besides,

604
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,380
I sacrificed my body

605
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,340
for you two.

606
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,900
He put a monitor

607
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,020
in my body.

608
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,280
A monitor!

609
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,620
He has seen both the inner and

610
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,640
outer part of my body.

611
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,620
Besides, today,

612
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,080
I watched the videos for you all day.

613
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,030
You and Sui Yi are really two good knives.

614
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,070
What do you mean?

615
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,580
The knives are stabbed deep into my ribs.

616
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,830
Let me stab you again.

617
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,860
Li Jun, male,

618
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,590
32 years old,

619
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,370
comes from Wenzhou.

620
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,260
He graduated from Wenzhou Medical School in 2013,

621
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,350
majoring in Medical Imageology,

622
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,580
and got a Bachelor's degree in Medicine.

623
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,340
He had average grades in school.

624
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,310
After graduation, he was an intern in Wenzhou Medical School

625
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:31,940
for a year,

626
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,740
and then joined the gastroenterology department of

627
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,450
Zhaonuan First Hosptial.

628
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,120
He's been an attending doctor there till now.

629
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,230
What time does he usually come in the morning?

630
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,890
Around ten in the morning.

631
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,380
Thank you.

632
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,080
May I ask

633
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,800
when Li Jun usually comes here?

634
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,860
He has a single lifestyle,

635
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,840
and is extremely self-disciplined.

636
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,170
He keeps a low profile,

637
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,800
and doesn't have many friends in the department,

638
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,580
but he gets along well with his colleagues.

639
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,550
The comment on him from his colleagues is that

640
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,470
he is not competitive

641
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,410
and doesn't have big ambition.

642
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,550
Both of his parents are laid-off workers of a shipyard

643
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,290
in Wenzhou.

644
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,860
They moved from their hometown to the city three years ago.

645
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,970
Li Jun paid for it.

646
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,530
He has a younger sister who is studying in a college in Panzhou.

647
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,720
I heard that when she first entered school,

648
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,460
she earned some pocket money by working part time in a milk tea shop.

649
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,820
She's been wearing clothes of luxury brands lately.

650
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,140
Does he have a girlfriend?

651
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,370
No.

652
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,940
He had a girlfriend in college.

653
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,040
They broke up after graduation.

654
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,920
Since then, he has never had a girlfriend.

655
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,050
He goes on dates with different young girls,

656
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,490
but he never brings them home.

657
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,830
In general,

658
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,090
he has never committed any crime

659
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,300
or offended anyone in our city.

660
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,760
Nor does he have any bad habits.

661
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,710
Where did he get the money?

662
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,810
Chen should have found out about it, right?

663
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,790
He used to resell domain names

664
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,930
and earned his first bucket of gold by it.

665
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,280
Later, he invested in stocks and encountered two rounds of cow markets.

666
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,110
That's it?

667
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,730
That's it.

668
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,260
I'm really jealous.

669
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,740
