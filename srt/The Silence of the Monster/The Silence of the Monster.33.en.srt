00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,039
My father is a very romantic person.

6
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,740
In fact, many people said

7
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,450
his quest for perfection was too harsh.

8
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,220
But only I know

9
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,900
my father wasn't like that.

10
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,970
He always told me

11
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,789
sometimes,

12
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,360
perfection is not the most important thing.

13
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,700
Those with defects

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,140
are likely to have soul.

15
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,260
So you think although this leaf pattern bowl

16
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,180
is not perfect,

17
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,990
it must be your father's work.

18
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,400
Yes.

19
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,400
Bean Bun.

20
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,490
Bean Bun.

21
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,450
Bean Bun.

22
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,520
Qing.

23
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,020
You said it was made by your father.

24
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:09,950
Are you sure?

25
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:10,940
I'm sure.

26
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,900
Why?

27
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:18,350
Look.

28
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,990
This leaf pattern bowl is ordinary.

29
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,520
How can you be sure

30
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,950
it was made by your father?

31
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,530
Because my father

32
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,740
would never pass off other people's works

33
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,820
as his own works.

34
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,340
This is the dignity of persons who make Jian Zhan.

35
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,270
Yes.

36
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,930
Your father

37
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,100
would never do such a thing.

38
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,860
But didn't you say

39
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,360
it was not made by Mr. Wang Jian?

40
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,220
Yes.

41
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,500
I lied that day.

42
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,780
Qing.

43
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,200
This leaf pattern bowl

44
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,450
is definitely your father's work.

45
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,530
Because I've seen it before.

46
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,100
By then,

47
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,100
they'll definitely come to you to verify

48
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,060
whether this leaf pattern bowl was made by me.

49
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,060
Qing

50
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,970
never dares to stick to her own ideas.

51
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,990
She is heartbroken because she can't make Jian Zhan

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,320
and can't inherit my career.

53
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,190
I don't care whether she can make Jian Zhan

54
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,480
or inherit my career.

55
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,610
My biggest wish

56
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,400
is that she can live the life she wants

57
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,460
and be who she really is.

58
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,940
I understand.

59
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,930
This is indeed my father's best work.

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,420
I look forward

173
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,190
to reading your books.

174
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,530
I just started to sort out these words.

175
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,660
I don't know

176
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,210
whether I can publish books.

177
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,530
But at least you have found

178
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,110
what you really want to do

179
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,620
and the direction of your life.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,960
You should

181
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,910
celebrate it.

182
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,020
I think

183
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,560
Jian Zhan is really

184
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,340
a very charming work of art.

185
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,800
I hope more people

186
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,340
can understand its charm.

187
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,550
My father was a master of Jian Zhan.

188
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,700
If no one wrote his story,

189
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,580
it would be a pity.

190
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,860
It is my responsibility and mission

191
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,690
to develop Jian Zhan culture

192
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,960
and let more people know about

193
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,870
my father's works and stories.

194
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,730
Wang Qing.

195
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,840
You look totally different

196
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,210
from what you looked like before.

197
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,740
You're radiant.

198
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,070
Miss. Sui.

199
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,580
You're

200
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,830
kind and righteous.

201
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,050
You can understand people

202
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,590
and are eloquent.

203
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,120
You

204
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,420
will become

205
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,210
an outstanding lawyer.

206
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,830
Thank you.

207
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,730
I hope we can be

208
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,080
better versions of ourselves.

209
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,370
Here.

210
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,370
Chufeng.

211
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,130
You know what?

212
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,190
Wang Qing resigned today.

213
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,610
She decided to focus on sorting out

214
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,310
and writing material about Jian Zhan.

215
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,580
She finally found

216
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,690
what she likes to do.

217
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,640
Her state

218
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,780
is totally different now.

219
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,960
I feel happy for her.

220
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,300
It's indeed a good thing.

221
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,100
Take your time.

222
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,180
Everything will be fine.

223
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,010
Let's go.

224
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:22,700
Let's go.

225
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,810
Although it's hard to explore,

226
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,260
as long as we keep working hard,

227
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,850
we can see hope.

228
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,850
I remember when I first came to the law firm,

229
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,450
I was a novice who knew nothing.

230
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,330
I thought my internship was so long,

231
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,660
as if I couldn't make it to the end.

232
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,900
But it's different now.

233
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,930
I've doubted myself,

234
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,970
but

235
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,770
I've grown quite fond of

236
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,720
this profession.

237
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,260
Ms. Su went to court today,

238
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,500
and I sat in on it.

239
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,580
My internship will be over soon.

240
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,970
When I become a full-fledged lawyer,

241
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll have chances to go to court.

242
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,300
I can argue with others

243
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,580
like Ms. Su

244
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,980
and protect my clients' rights and interests.

245
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,600
I feel passionate

246
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,360
when I think about it.

247
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,940
It's very lucky to be able to

248
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,200
find something you like

249
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,430
and work hard for it.

250
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,870
We're both lucky people.

251
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,410
I hope you can say it

252
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,490
to Robin.

253
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,420
It's rare to meet a friend

254
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,290
who knows us and be known by us.

255
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,070
We are all running forward.

256
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,140
I, you,

257
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,180
Robin and An.

258
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,300
We're the same kind of people.

259
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,250
We care about each other.

260
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,010
No matter how much shock and anger

261
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,690
you have,

262
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,090
your heart

263
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,660
can never be a hard stone.

264
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,690
That's who you are.

265
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,010
Let's go.

266
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,180
Cheer up.

267
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,820
Say hello.

268
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,090
Hello, Miss Fang.

269
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,540
Qiqi.

270
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,900
What are you doing?

271
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,530
Marry me.

272
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,010
Marry him. Marry him.

273
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:53,750
No.

274
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,180
Qiqi.

275
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,730
You just lost your memory.

276
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,250
You love me very much.

277
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,180
We used to love each other.

278
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,870
I believe you'll remember that.

279
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,460
But I can't wait.

280
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,730
It doesn't matter if you can't remember.

281
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,250
I just want you to be my bride.

282
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,300
I just lost my memory.

283
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,130
But my feelings

284
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,880
didn't change.

285
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,170
Get up.

286
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,240
Don't waste your time.

287
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,940
Don't be like this, Qiqi.

288
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,340
I know you haven't figured out many things.

289
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,100
But trust me.

290
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,860
I can take good care of you.

291
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,030
I've thought it through.

292
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,980
I don't love you.

293
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,940
No. Qiqi.

294
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,930
You love me.

295
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,200
I love Robin.

296
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,550
Robin?

297
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,900
You were just released.

298
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:17,780
Do you have

299
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,960
any plans for the future?

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,730
I think

301
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,260
it's better to implement some plans

302
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,540
as soon as possible.

303
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,010
If you need help,

304
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,870
just let me know.

305
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,580
You're welcome.

306
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,380
Jin,

307
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,800
you've been helping me since I was released.

308
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,560
I feel sorry.

309
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,520
Enough.

310
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,550
It's just a little money.

311
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,560
I really should thank you.

312
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,370
If you hadn't taken care of me in the prison back then,

313
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,750
I wouldn't be here today.

314
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,180
When your plan is completed,

315
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,990
come to me if you want to make some plans

316
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,660
for the future.

317
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,590
You're welcome anytime.

318
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,580
Okay.

319
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,110
Here, have some tea.

320
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,780
I don't dare

321
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:15,940
to think

322
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,740
or mention the past.

323
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:20,670
Jin.

324
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,380
Jin!

325
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,020
Jin!

326
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,610
Wen.

327
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,550
I'm here.

328
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:30,740
Come here.

329
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,350
Sit down and have some tea.

330
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,370
I'm not in the mood for it.

331
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,060
Let me introduce him.

332
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,500
Cheng Wen.

333
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
My partner.

334
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,860
Hello.

335
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,390
I'm Gu Nan.

336
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,130
Hello.

337
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,120
Sit down.

338
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,180
What's wrong?

339
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,220
Why are you so angry?

340
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,260
It's okay. We're friends.

341
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:56,820
Tell us.

342
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Qiqi told her father

343
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,370
she wants to break off her engagement to me.

344
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,480
It figures.

345
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,170
Since she came back,

346
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,970
she has been lukewarm to you.

347
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,980
Do you really think she's going to marry you?

348
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,300
No.

349
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,410
The point is that she not only wants to break off her engagement to me,

350
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,670
but also has someone she wants to marry.

351
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,490
Who is it?

352
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,060
The appraiser I keep telling you about.

353
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,760
The one who can identify anything. Robin.

354
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,550
Robin?

355
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,200
He pesters Qiqi every day.

356
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,780
Qiqi was bewitched by him.

357
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,210
I can't understand.

358
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,650
He's just an appraiser.

359
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,970
How good can he be?

360
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,350
You can't blame others.

361
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,680
You can't even handle your fiancee.

362
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
I don't understand.

363
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,740
Is it difficult to handle a woman?

364
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,810
If you can't handle her, you can use force.

365
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,780
No.

366
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,470
I know Qiqi.

367
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,220
Force won't work.

368
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,010
Of course you can't.

369
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,560
You used force before.

370
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,220
You not only failed,

371
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,310
but also injured her.

372
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,880
Does Qiqi's father know

373
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,060
the truth about her injury?

374
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,140
Not yet.

375
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,800
Thanks to the words you taught me, I hid it.

376
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,160
You can hide it for a while.

377
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,270
But it can't be hidden forever.

378
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,140
Before her father knows the truth,

379
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,830
you must let Qiqi marry you.

380
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,900
I know that.

381
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,660
So I'm here today

382
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,420
to ask you to give me a suggestion.

383
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,970
What suggestion can I have?

384
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,110
This is your business.

385
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,500
I

386
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,920
can only remind you

387
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,030
that time is running out.

388
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,890
You told me at that time

389
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,940
that you would solve it after the new year.

390
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,980
Look.

391
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,500
If it goes on like this,

392
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,120
I can only cooperate with someone else.

393
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,750
No, Jin.

394
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,090
You know my sincerity.

395
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,780
I sincerely cooperate with you.

396
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,220
I know.

397
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,350
I also sincerely cooperate with you.

398
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,980
But business is business.

399
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,100
Time is running out.

400
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,860
You

401
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,500
are making things difficult for me too.

402
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,140
Well, Jin.

403
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,580
Since I've got your deposit,

404
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,110
I'll get it done

405
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,380
before the deadline.

406
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,060
Don't tell me that you'll get it done.

407
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,480
Tell me how you'll get it done.

408
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,030
Sorry to interrupt.

409
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,090
Your fiancee's sweetheart is Luo...

410
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,740
Robin.

411
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,190
Yes.

412
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,120
Do you know him?

413
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,700
He's just an appraiser.

414
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,610
There's nothing special about him.

415
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,120
Then

416
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,180
you have to let your fiancee give up first.

417
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,380
Yes.

418
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,820
That's right.

419
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,010
I think...

420
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,370
You're angry anyway.

421
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,380
You can first find a way

422
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,190
to catch him

423
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,470
and beat him up.

424
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,420
You can vent your anger.

425
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,900
If it's easy,

426
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,180
you can kill him.

427
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,100
You can get the best of both worlds.

428
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:01,740
Jin,

429
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,160
that's what I want.

430
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,060
What do you think?

431
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:06,750
Here.

432
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,680
Mr. Gu.

433
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,340
Thank you.

434
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,060
Hello?

435
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,780
A client asked me to come and identify his things.

436
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,550
I'll go there.

437
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,570
It won't take long.

438
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,310
See you later.

439
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,010
I miss you too.

440
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,650
Okay, bye.

441
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,060
Mr. Jin.

442
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,620
Do these all need to be identified?

443
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,120
Mr. Luo.

444
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,260
Do you still remember me?

445
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,050
Mr. Jin.

446
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,360
I'm really sorry.

447
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,490
I'm prone to be allergic.

448
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,250
This building is not well-ventilated.

449
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,090
I'm going out for some fresh air.

450
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,060
Let's continue when I'm back.

451
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,900
Wait a moment.

452
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,440
Han told me

453
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,440
you are a freelance appraiser now.

454
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,410
Can you get a job?

455
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes.

456
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,860
But it's not stable.

457
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,100
You don't make much money, right?

458
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:26,760
It's enough.

459
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,540
Look.

460
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:32,980
I

461
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,650
often buy a lot of works of art.

462
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,410
When I buy a lot,

463
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,420
I might make mistakes.

464
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,070
So I need someone

465
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,250
to check them for me.

466
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,860
I think you are

467
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,810
professional and all-round.

468
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,740
Would you like to

469
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,140
be my exclusive appraiser?

470
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,340
Mr. Jin.

471
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,880
Thank you for your appreciation.

472
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,640
But I'm satisfied with my current situation.

473
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,820
I don't want to change my job yet.

474
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,820
Relax.

475
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,260
Don't reject my offer so quickly.

476
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,180
I want to invite you to be my exclusive appraiser.

477
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,550
I won't treat you badly.

478
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,610
Your fixed monthly salary will be 50,000 yuan.

479
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,520
And I'll pay for every appraisal fee.

480
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,740
What do you think?

481
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,940
Mr. Jin.

482
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,500
I'm not good enough.

483
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,420
I can't bear such a heavy burden.

484
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,400
Besides,

485
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,460
I'm used to working alone.

486
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,500
It's good to be a freelance appraiser.

487
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,330
I want to hire you because I think highly of you.

488
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,050
How dare you

489
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,160
be picky?

490
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,660
I always get

491
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,240
what I want.

492
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,690
Mr. Jin.

493
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,010
Let's talk nicely.

494
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,090
Will you listen if we talk nicely?

495
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,130
There's no chance.

496
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,500
Hello?

497
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,290
Where are you?

498
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,180
I'm at the law firm.

499
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,410
What's wrong?

500
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,900
Nothing.

501
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,170
Be careful if you go out today.

502
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,960
Okay.

503
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,740
What's wrong?

504
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,080
I...

505
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,170
Nothing.

506
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,780
I just want to ask you.

507
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm worried.

508
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,260
Don't worry.

509
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,620
I'll be careful.

510
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:32,690
By the way,

511
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,570
I have a piece of good news to tell you.

512
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,460
Ms. Su told me

513
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,930
she can bring me to court next month.

514
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,990
And I can be the defence then.

515
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,160
That's great.

516
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,510
Get ready then.

517
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,370
Of course I will.

518
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,290
This is what I've been dreaming of.

519
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,620
See you tonight.

520
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,820
See you tonight.

521
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,760
Bye.

522
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,030
Agarwood?

523
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,340
Isn't this the one Robin showed me before?

524
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,740
Then this is fake.

525
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,940
Why is it so expensive?

526
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,620
Hello.

527
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,380
I'm Sui Yi, an apprentice lawyer

528
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,530
from Junhao Law Firm.

529
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,780
May I ask

530
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,050
is Mr. Jin there?

531
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,930
Yes.

532
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,660
Here's the thing.

533
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,060
I have something

534
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,500
to consult Mr. Jin.

535
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,560
I wonder if he is available.

536
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,780
If you're available,

537
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,140
you can come here.

538
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,090
Let's make it clear face to face.

539
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,560
OK.

540
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,420
This voice sounds familiar.

541
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,860
They're playing this?

542
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:32,890
I told you long ago

543
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,000
to stay away from her.

544
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,130
Why did you still engage in

545
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,510
such an emotional drama?

546
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,690
Yes.

547
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,810
There's a phrase called "perfect match".

548
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,120
It's used to warn people like you.

549
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,970
You are not the same kind.

550
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,580
Don't try to get along.

551
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,300
Cheng Wen.

552
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,090
You recognized my voice.

553
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,810
Where is Fang Qi?

554
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,200
Fang Qi.

555
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,280
Don't mention Fang Qi to me.

556
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,090
How dare you mention Fang Qi to me?

557
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,460
It's all because of you.

558
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,860
Without you, Fang Qi

559
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,140
would have married me.

560
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,630
Do you know?

561
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,480
When I proposed to her,

562
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,470
I was humiliated by both of you.

563
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,270
It's all because of you.

564
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,700
Fang Qi told me

565
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,460
the person she loves is you.

566
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,270
Does she know what love is?

567
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,640
Does she know what love is?

568
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,290
Yes.

569
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,660
I really...

570
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,060
I really should let Fang Qi

571
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,270
see what you are like now.

572
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,370
But don't worry.

573
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,910
I'm not that stupid.

574
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,610
If she saw it,

575
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,660
she wouldn't marry me.

576
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,040
Fang Qi, that bitch,

577
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,780
is really difficult to handle.

578
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,120
Watch your mouth!

579
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,690
You have a problem with that?

580
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,580
You have a problem with that?

581
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,010
Hit me then.

582
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,100
Hit me.

583
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,990
What happened?

584
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,270
What took you so long?

585
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,410
He wanted to kill me.

586
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,740
He held on for so long after being drugged.

587
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,450
He's tough.

588
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,070
He wanted to kill me.

589
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,980
Who is to blame?

590
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,580
Blame yourself.

591
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,190
You can't even handle

592
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,420
your girlfriend.

593
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,590
Hurry up.

594
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,730
Do what you should do.

595
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,730
What should we do now?

596
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,380
What else can we do?

597
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,410
I tied him up here.

598
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,820
Do as planned.

599
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,240
If you can't get the route,

600
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,290
I'll find someone else to work with.

601
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,690
OK.

602
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,900
Wait for me, Jin.

603
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,570
Wait for me. I'll go now.

604
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,190
Trust me.

605
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,290
You hit me.

606
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,640
You hit me.

607
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,490
-Wait for me. -That's enough.

608
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,720
Go.

609
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,730
I didn't expect to meet you again.

610
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,900
Enemies are bound to meet.

611
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,800
You insisted on selling fake goods.

612
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,780
As an appraiser,

613
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,500
I can't lie.

614
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,469
Don't talk nonsense.

615
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,780
Every dog has its day.

616
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,659
Now you are in my hands.

617
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,489
What do you want?

618
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,980
Your partner beat me up last time.

619
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,889
I was humiliated.

620
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:31,690
I want to take revenge.

621
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,400
But your accomplice

622
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,420
already hit me.

623
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,409
He hit you.

624
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,190
I didn't hit you yet.

625
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,620
You offended many people.

626
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,139
Put the saddle on the right horse.

627
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,010
Every debt has its debtor.

628
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,480
What do you want?

629
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,390
Don't be afraid.

630
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,530
I won't hit you.

631
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,280
It's over.

632
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,070
Let's talk about cooperation.

633
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,820
Work for me.

634
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,880
You saw my things.

635
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,810
Many of my things are not real.

636
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,070
You know they're not real?

637
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,820
Of course.

638
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,110
They told me the truth when I bought them.

639
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,460
Then why did you buy them?

640
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,710
You know that better than me.

641
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,330
Real things and fake things.

642
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,060
Real goods may not be sold at a high price.

643
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,740
Fake goods may not be cheap.

644
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,860
Who has the final say?

645
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,610
An appraiser.

646
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,200
Work for me.

647
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,660
Not only will I not hit you,

648
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,530
but I will also protect you.

649
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,620
You want to do this kind of business?

650
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,020
The most profitable way is

651
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,870
to sell real and fake goods together.

652
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,010
Just work for me.

653
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,020
Let's have a monopoly on the market.

654
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,210
You will get the benefits.

655
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,240
What benefits?

656
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,350
I'll give you...

657
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,220
What are you doing?

658
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,490
Stop struggling.

659
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,850
I got a new one.

660
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,760
You can't open it.

661
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,410
Let's work together.

662
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,660
For each order,

663
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,780
I'll give you 10% commission.

664
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,560
10%?

665
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,380
10% can't attract me.

666
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,990
You know my popularity.

667
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,680
No matter what I say,

668
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,790
many people can be fooled by me.

669
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,740
It's not a good deal.

670
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,780
How much do you want?

671
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,740
50%.

672
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,250
You're arrogant.

673
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,920
You need a helper.

674
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,510
A spokesperson.

675
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,830
Because you're afraid he'll find out.

676
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,740
You're afraid Ji Xiuyi will find out

677
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,660
you're buying and selling fake goods.

678
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,160
You're using his money to buy fake things

679
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,040
and selling them with real things.

680
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,720
How did you know?

681
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,930
How did I know?

682
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,820
I just know.

683
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,700
