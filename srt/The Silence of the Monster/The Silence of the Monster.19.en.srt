Tell me.

00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,060
I'll accept the amount no matter how much he asked.

I can write him an IOU now.

You misunderstood.

I'm not here to talk about money.

Do you know why she did that?

As the only person she can rely on,

so that she won't be bullied outside.

53
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,200
She worked at the grill house

54

to make money.

55
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,700
Because she thought she could become stronger

56

Big Force,

175
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,780
I want to apologize to you.

176
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,330
I was too harsh last time.

177
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,010
Can you forgive me?

178
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,090
If you want to protect me, you have to be strong first.

179
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,500
What do you think is being strong?

180
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,540
Making a lot of money?

181
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,350
Right.

182
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,520
Yes.

183
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,570
But it's just one thing.

184
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,040
It's not the most important one.

185
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,510
What else?

186
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,910
You want to sue your uncle.

187
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,860
So you found Sui Yi,

188
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,120
because she knows the law.

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,970
You were afraid that your mom would be locked in the house.

190
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
So you found me,

191
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,200
because I can open the lock.

192
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,290
We all have some skills

193
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,620
that can help others.

194
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,300
But I know nothing.

195
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,100
You should go back to school,

196
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,860
study further there

197
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,290
and learn more about the world.

198
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,850
Later you'll find what you're good at.

199
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,400
By then,

200
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,730
you can protect yourself,

201
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,590
your mom

202
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,400
and help others.

203
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,980
Big Force, you're smart.

204
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,070
Don't waste your talent.

205
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,860
That's why you said

206
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,760
to protect others,

207
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,390
you have to strengthen yourself first.

208
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:09,620

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,750
Did you sleep well last night?

343
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,890
Yes.

344
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,700
You didn't come back last night.

345
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,760
So she slept in my room.

346
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,800
It's okay.

347
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,650
I don't mind.

348
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,850
You can sleep in my room even thought I'm not at home.

349
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,280
You can sleep with me tonight.

350
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,600
It's okay.

351
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,970
She can always sleep in my room.

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,840
I can sleep on the sofa.

353
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,420
We are girls.

354
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,820
It's more convenient for us to sleep together.

355
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,700
It's more convenient to sleep alone.

356
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,700
It's inconvenient for you to sleep on the sofa.

357
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,470
I'd better sleep with Sui Yi.

358
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,210
I'm really fine.

359
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,010
You can stay in my room forever.

360
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,520
It's too crowded for two people sleeping together.

361
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,060
I just want to sleep with Sui Yi.

362
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,340
OK.

363
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,010
Sui Yi, have this.

364
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,650
Thank you.

365
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,750
Robin!

366
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,890
I have a question for you.

367
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,620
Go ahead.

368
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,070
Have you seen Chufeng's family?

369
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,890
What?

370
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,060
You want to visit his parents?

371
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,070
No.

372
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,020
It has nothing to do

373
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,750
with meeting parents.

374
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,540
What do you want to do?

375
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,130
We went to find Big Force yesterday.

376
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,420
There was a man who testified for Big Force.

377
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,790
He's in his early 40s.

378
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,700
I think he seems to know Chufeng.

379
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,770
How did he introduce the man to you?

380
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,900
When I saw them,

381
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,690
they seemed to have a subtle relationship.

382
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,660
So I didn't ask.

383
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,750
He didn't tell me either.

384
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,780
How were they?

385
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,430
I was wondering

386
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,940
if he's Chufeng's family member

387
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,890
or relatives?

388
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,490
You two are so close and classmates.

389
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,480
So I want to ask you.

390
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,660
Although we're close,

391
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,850
he didn't tell me

392
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,260
you were together.

393
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,680
What?

394
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,310
I'm not wearing contact lenses.

395
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,260
I didn't hear you.

396
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,730
Don't insult my eyesight.

397
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,580
But I really don't know

398
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,250
who that person is.

399
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,840
Okay.

400
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,740
I'm going upstairs.

401
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,250
Thanks for your lunch.

402
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,560
Come in.

403
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,740
Are you going to sleep?

404
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:32,920
Yes.

405
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,500
Do you

406
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,820
want to join me?

407
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,050
That's too fast.

408
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,230
I'll beat you up.

409
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,490
♫Getting closer to feel your gentle breathing♫

410
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,980
Are you sure?

411
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,800
If not, I'll sleep alone.

Hello.

459
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,100
I'm looking for Robin, the appraiser.

460
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,810
He's not here right now.

461
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,610
May I help you?

462
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,940
It's produced in Barcelona in the 60s.

463
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,700
It's an enamel three-hand pocket watch.

464
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,200
It has special needle, large balance wheel,

465
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,190
and a seven-diamond machine.

466
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,970
With gold inlaying decorations,

467
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
it's very rare.

468
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,050
Hello, I'm Robin.

469
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,820
Hello, Robin.

470
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,560
Mr. Han introduced me here.

471
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,730
Yes. Mr. Han.

472
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,090
He told me about this.

473
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,100
Can I take a look at this watch?

474
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:16,910
Sure.

475
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,130
Let me have a look.

476
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,450
She's right.

477
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,850
How much is it worth?

478
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,560
About 3,000 yuan.

479
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,140
If there is a certificate, an original packaging box,

480
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,180
or you can prove

481
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,380
its previous owner

482
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,410
is a celebrity,

483
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,770
the price will be higher.

484
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,610
Really?

485
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,090
Yes.

486
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,840
Okay.

487
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,250
I see.

488
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,230
Are you going to sell this watch?

489
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:53,850
No, thanks.

490
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,030

491
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:01,770

How do you know these?

494
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,310
I don't know.

495
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,700
Those ideas suddenly popped out.

496
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,370
Are you pretending to have amnesia?

497
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,890
Your guess makes sense.

498
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,320
But I really forget everything.

499
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,280
Are you an appraiser?

500
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,660
Or a curator, a designer?

501
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,140
Are you the jewelry seller, antiques seller

502
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,000
or the salesperson of luxury brands?

503
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,690
Or,

504
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,060
are you an auctioneer?

505
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,510
What's wrong?

506
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,370
Are you waiting for my answer?

507
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,170
Yes.

508
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,450
Wait.

509
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,210
I'm not color blind.

510
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,620
How do you know?

511
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,000
Because your eyes are light brown.

512
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,620
Yes, you're not color blind.

513
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,250
Let's do a test.

514
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,610
Where is the capital of China?

515
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,170
Beijing.

516
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,290
How many centimeters in one meter?

517
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:09,820
100.

518
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,600
What is the power of two?

519
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,010
Eight.

520
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,090
What's your name?

521
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,030
I don't know.

522
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,190
Who you are?

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,050
I don't know.

524
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,170
Do you speak German?

525
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,440
I said I didn't lie to you.

526
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,080
You're really something.

527
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,660
Thank you. I'll take this as a praise.

528

I like you so much.

529
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,920
What? I didn't catch you.

530
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,510
Nothing.

can you stop telling people

694

Sure.

715

The price seems reasonable.

Otherwise, it'll be a waste.
