00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:42,900
Let me tell you.

8
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,930
I think he's the most likely one to do this.

9
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,780
I agree with you.

10
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,940
He doesn't look kind.

11
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,700
It's him.

12
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,240
Are you talking about that Gu?

13
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,420
I told you

14
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,460
he's not a simple person.

15
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,860
Didn't I tell you? He was released not long ago.

16
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,300
A friend of mine

17
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,500
went to their restaurant for dinner two days ago.

18
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,500
He seemed to be scared.

19
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,880
He said Gu threatened him.

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,170
Should we remind Song?

21
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,500
But it seems that He Chufeng vouched for him.

22
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,060
Don't you know he is a locksmith?

23
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,300
If he wants to commit a crime,

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,500
it will be easy.

25
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,060
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,979
Nothing.

27
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,750
What's wrong with He Chufeng?

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,300
Such serious things have happened.

29
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,620
Can't we discuss it?

30
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,020
Sure, you can.

31
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,010
That's right.

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,410
He is not a decent person.

33
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,510
If He Chufeng didn't vouch for him,

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,740
would he have come here?

35
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,020
Those cats might be

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,300
abused by him.

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,820
That's right.

38
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,480
So what does it have to do with He Chufeng?

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,310
If you're sure about what you said,

40
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,790
you can say this has something to do with him.

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,650
But the problem is you're just guessing.

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,740
If you have are quite free now,

43
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,260
can't you do other things that are more important?

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,350
Listen, you...

45
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,360
Let's go.

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,070
Don't pull me.

47
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,650
Listen.

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,660
You...

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,020
I think it must be him.

50
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,420
Let go!

51
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,030
Why are you pulling me?

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,520
Although I said that just now,

53
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,450
what do you think?

54
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,890
What do you mean?

55
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,050
You know what I meant!

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,750
Your master...

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,660
You suspect him too?

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,800
Of course I do.

59
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,050
The bell was found

60
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,540
at the door of the grill house.

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,780
And

62
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,890
there was blood at his door.

63
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,440
If this has nothing to do with him,

64
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,430
I can't believe it.

65
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,520
I don't know

66
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,340
what I should think him now.

67
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,490
Robin.

68
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Don't jump to conclusions

69
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,990
before we have evidence.

70
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,380
Zhen said

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,300
she was not sure.

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,280
Not sure?

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
We lost Bean Bun.

74
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,010
You should open his door and ask him.

75
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:23,940
You should check whether

76
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,810
it's at his place directly.

77
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,810
I don't believe

78
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,440
you don't know what to do.

79
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,450
Let me think about it.

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,280
You still need to think about it?

81
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,820
I think you're not worried at all.

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,829
I brought Bean Bun back.

83
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,220
I'm more worried about its missing.

84
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,780
I don't think you're worried at all.

85
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,540
If you're not looking for it,

86
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,430
fine, I will.

87
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,090
Hello.

88
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,579
Hello.

89
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,460
A car owner parked on the highway.

90
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,220
He got off the car but it unlocked automatically.

91
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,140
It's an emergency.

92
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,180
Please come here right away.

93
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,510
Okay.

94
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,660
Tell me the address.

95
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,380
I'll be right there.

96
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,220
Did someone find Bean Bun?

97
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,500
No.

98
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,010
I...

99
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
need to open a lock now.

100
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,140
What?

101
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,260
You still need to work when Bean Bun's missing?

102
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,550
If anything happens to Bean Bun,

103
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,660
will you regret it?

104
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,760
You look for it now.

105
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,820
I'll be right back.

106
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,900
He Chufeng.

107
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,079
He Chufeng!

108
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,410
Let me ask you.

109
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,779
If something happens to me one day,

110
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,019
will you open the lock too?

111
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,220
Fine!

112
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,940
Change it to 1 p.m. right?

113
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,990
Okay, thank you.

114
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,780
When she rushed over,

115
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,120
it was already 1:40 p.m.

116
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,260
Ms. Su could be late too?

117
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,000
It's once in a blue moon.

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:31,980
Come in.

119
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,260
Ms. Su,

120
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,380
I'm here to apologize.

121
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,180
The notice today...

122
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,660
I hate making mistakes

123
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,580
because of others' mistakes.

124
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,320
I'm sorry, Ms. Su

125
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,860
It was indeed my mistake today.

126
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,780
I'm willing to bear the consequences.

127
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,290
How?

128
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,900
By your resignation?

129
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,660
Or by telling the party

130
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,020
the whole story

131
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,620
that my lawyer

132
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,500
told me the wrong time

133
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,360
so I was late?

134
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,380
Fortunately, it was mediation today

135
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,230
and they've forgiven us.

136
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,060
If it's a formal trial,

137
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,970
then the judge, court clerks,

138
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,820
our client and the opposing party's attorney,

139
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,110
even our whole law firm

140
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,120
will bear the consequences

141
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,970
because of the number you mistyped.

142
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,100
I'm sorry, Ms. Su.

143
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,270
It's because...

144
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,380
No matter what reason you have,

145
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,900
it can't be your excuse to make the mistake.

146
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,180
I'll think about it carefully

147
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,300
about your internship appraisal report.

148
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,370
You may get back to work now.

149
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,580
Ms. Su was late because...

150
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,890
Sui Yi is a nice person.

151
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,400
This Meco juice tea

152
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,510
was recommended by her.

153
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,530
It's not only delicious, but there's no preservatives.

154
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,950
It's very healthy.

155
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,610
I think it's good.

156
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,510
I bought it for my girlfriend.

157
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,180
She also said I had good taste.

158
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,680
What a pity.

159
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,740
I didn't say it.

160
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,220
As for the game company case,

161
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,260
have you found the rest of the files

162
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,780
and evidence in details?

163
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,130
Do you still need them?

164
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,060
Of course.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,500
Let me take a look.

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,700
Chufeng.

167
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,320
Why are you here?

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,880
I just got off work,

169
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,100
so I stopped by.

170
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,840
I'm a little cold at night shift.

171
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,230
I came back to add some clothes.

172
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,820
Come in.

173
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,210
What are you looking for?

174
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,230
Have you seen Bean Bun recently?

175
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,890
Bean Bun?

176
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,940
Isn't it the fat cat

177
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,470
that you raised?

178
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:41,850
What's the matter with it?

179
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,370
It's lost.

180
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,870
Lost?

181
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,660
When did it happen?

182
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,260
Where is it missing?

183
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,670
Chufeng.

184
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Are you here

185
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,750
for Bean Bun?

186
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,180
Let me ask you.

187
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,850
Why was there blood

188
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,180
at your door this morning?

189
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,230
You...

190
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,210
suspect me?

191
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:55,970
Boss.

192
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,250
Boss.

193
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,190
I heard you lost your cat.

194
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,410
Did you find it?

195
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,660
Not yet.

196
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,130
Do you have any clues?

197
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,830
I... No, no.

198
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,620
I didn't see your cat.

199
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,720
Then what are you here for?

200
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,290
The cat abuse is quite serious recently.

201
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,940
I picked up

202
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,640
a pen before.

203
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,570
I just want to tell you

204
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,950
there is some cat hair

205
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,220
with blood on that pen.

206
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,380
Why didn't you tell me

207
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,100
last time?

208
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,420
Just because I committed a crime

209
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,330
and went in prison before,

210
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,630
so you all suspect me,

211
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,940
right?

212
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,060
That's not what I meant.

213
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,970
I can't start over

214
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,060
just because I committed a crime before?

215
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,780
If anything happens now.

216
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,740
it's all my fault.

217
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,660
As long as it's something evil, it must be done by me, right?

218
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,340
Do you think the cats were abused

219
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,920
by me?

220
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,960
And I also killed the cat?

221
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,660
Even your cat's missing

222
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,940
was also because of me, right?

223
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,020
I said I didn't mean that.

224
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,980
I just want to ask you

225
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,260
if you have seen Bean Bun recently.

226
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,040
Since yesterday,

227
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,330
we've searched every corner

228
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,020
of the community.

229
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,200
I've told you

230
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,180
that it wasn't me!

231
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,880
It really wasn't me.

232
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,680
I really didn't see it.

233
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,620
The cat...

234
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,970
wasn't killed by me.

235
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,550
I've never abused a cat.

236
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,470
I have no idea

237
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,210
where your Bean Bun is.

238
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,490
I have to go to work later.

239
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,250
Are you crazy?

240
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,790
Robin!

241
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,930
Any news about Bean Bun?

242
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,740
It's up to you.

243
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,340
I'll give you one day only.

244
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,190
Listen.

245
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,720
Don't be shameless.

246
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,480
If I tell anyone about the things you did,

247
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,020
no one will dare to hire you again.

248
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,180
Try it.

249
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,530
You...

250
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,860
See if I'm afraid of you.

251
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,160
Fine.

252
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,330
Wait and see.

253
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,370
Let's see who will be killed in the end.

254
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,170
Go ahead.

255
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,940
What did you have for dinner?

256
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,610
I'm so angry.

257
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,540
I haven't eaten yet.

258
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,510
What a guy!

259
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,950
Would you like some milk tea?

260
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,740
Sure.

261
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,360
What's wrong?

262
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,610
Are you in a bad mood?

263
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,080
As a part-timer,

264
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,240
who cares about my mood?

265
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,780
I'm quitting anyway.

266
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,300
Why?

267
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,610
What's wrong?

268
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,450
Who wants to work here?

269
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,710
What happened to your forehead?

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,440
Nothing.

271
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,980
I understand you.

272
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,500
Your boss is really rude.

273
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,790
The last time she came to my shop

274
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,780
to find that pen,

275
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,530
it felt like she thought I stole it.

276
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,900
You've been working for her for so long.

277
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,900
It's not easy for you to work for her.

278
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,980
She did more than that.

279
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,230
It's fine that she's not nice to people,

280
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,030
but...

281
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,770
Have you heard?

282
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,620
There are many cat abuses in the community recently.

283
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,380
I heard.

284
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,990
I have an exotic shorthair cat.

285
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:58,970
It's called Bean Bun.

286
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,780
It got lost last night.

287
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,620
Is it the cat

288
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,640
on the flyers posted everywhere?

289
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,380
That's your cat?

290
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,160
Yes.

291
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:06,780
Have you seen it?

292
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,300
No.

293
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,680
Does your boss have a cat?

294
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,170
Last time she came to our shop to find a pen,

295
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,700
there was a set of cat hair on it.

296
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,780
I don't know how it got on it.

297
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,720
It's weird.

298
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,900
Don't mention it to me.

299
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,780
Disgusting.

300
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,980
Do you still want milk tea?

301
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,890
I'll make you two cups.

302
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,230
I'll close the store if you don't want it anymore.

303
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,620
No, thanks. We are good.

304
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,240
There must be something wrong with that shop.

305
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,500
Are you talking about the clerk or the landlady?

306
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,680
It's possible for both.

307
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,150
Let's ask Chufeng when he comes back.

308
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:49,930
I won't.

309
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,930
Ask him if you want to.

310
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,620
What's wrong?

311
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,940
Did you have a fight?

312
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,020
Let's wait for Chufeng.

313
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,640
You're back.

314
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,340
Hello, Song.

315
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,190
Okay, I'll be right there.

316
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,630
I need to go to Song's shop.

317
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,540
Why?

318
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,450
Shall we come with you?

319
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,290
No.

320
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,780
I can go by myself.

321
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,860
This is the CCTV from the night before yesterday.

322
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,830
We can't make a conclusion.

323
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,160
Because we didn't see

324
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,190
exactly what happened.

325
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,089
Zhen said

326
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,550
there was blood at the door of his room.

327
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,099
There was a cat mewing in his room.

328
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,619
Zhen told me this too.

329
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,900
But she said

330
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,380
she didn't hear it clearly.

331
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,660
So she wasn't so sure.

332
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,140
Did you ask him?

333
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,109
Why are you here?

334
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,180
I think something is going to happen.

335
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,560
I'll ask him face to face.

336
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,080
So you all think it's me,

337
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:39,880
right?

338
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,900
You have to tell me

339
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,410
what happened.

340
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,710
I said it wasn't me.

341
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,170

512
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,360
Who is the judge to

513
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
to tell the wrong from the right?

514
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,190
These unscrupulous rules

515
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,910
are made by those incompetent people

516
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,990
to restrict us.

517
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,910
Chufeng.

518
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,420
You and I are both genius.

519
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,060
And a genius

520
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,700
is destined to break this rule.

521
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,250
It's not like that.

522
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,050
Com here.

523
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:18,650
Master.

524
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,450
Get in.

525
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,200
Calm down.

526
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,390
Be good. Get in the car.

527
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,660
Get in.

528
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,500

529

530
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,690

531
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,980

532

Wait for me.

533
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,320
In 15 minutes,

534
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,820
we'll make a new rule.

535
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,500
I'll let you remember this!

536
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,220
Young man,

537
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,730
do you need help?

538
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,080
No.

539
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,430
I just...

540
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,940
forgot to take my umbrella.

541
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,710
Okay, be careful.

542
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,480
You didn't do anything wrong six years ago.

543
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,750
I made the mistake.

544
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,020
I've been trying to make up for it.

545
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,660
He Chufeng.

546
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,140
You're a good boy.

547
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,700
You're upright and kind.

548
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,180
You didn't do anything wrong.

549
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,170
I know

550
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,890
we're not the same kind of people.

551
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,410
But the saddest thing

552
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,500
is not everything I lost

553
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,900
in prison for so many years,

554
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,850
but in your mind,

555
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,610
I'm always a bad guy.

556
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,070
Uncle Nan.

557
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,280
Uncle Nan, are you home?

558
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,630
Big Force.

559
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,600
This...

560
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,150
Uncle Nan.

561
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,060
Is it time for the dressing change?

562
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:30,810
How to do it?

563
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,970
Come to me, baby.

564
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,020
This kitten...

565
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,890
-was picked up by Uncle Nan the night before yesterday. -Be good. Stop yelling.

566
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,330
In the back alley,

567
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,530
the kitten got hurt somehow.

568
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,090
Uncle Nan brought it back.

569
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,320
It was bleeding.

570
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,800
Uncle Nan bandaged it.

571
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,950
Uncle Nan.

572
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,310
Is it time to change the dressing?

573
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,260
How?

574
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,710
I'll change it later.

575
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,580
How is it today?

576
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,090
It's not as bad as yesterday, right?

577
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,260
Yes. It's better today.

578
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,220
It didn't mew very often.

579
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,330
Baby, it's okay.

580
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:14,500
Bean Bun.

581
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,790
Where have you been these days?

582
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,540
Do you know how anxious we were?

583
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,060
You're back.

584
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,860
Bean Bun is back?

585
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,580
Did he kidnap a wife?

586
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,449
I heard its voice as soon as I opened the door.

587
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,440
And I found that he took another one.

588
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:51,980
Come out. Bean Bun.

589
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,199
Do you know we closed our store

590
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,449
because of you?

591
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,980
Remember to close the doors and windows.

592
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,970
I don't want this to happen again.

593
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,670
What about this kitten?

594
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,900
Take it to the vet tomorrow

595
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,960
for a general check-up.

596
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,910
It's all on you!

597
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,310
I hate making mistakes

598
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,220
because of others' mistakes.

599
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,690
What's wrong with you?

600
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,850
It's a long story.

601
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,910
It's fine.

602
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,370
It's good that it's back.

603
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,540
You can't fight now!

604
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,440
You won't be able to fight this time, right?

605
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,820
I'll lock you both up in there.

606
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,730
Don't move!

607
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,020
Bean Bun.

608
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,930
Are you safe now?

609
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,770
How should we address this kitten?

610
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,220
Bean Pudding.

611
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,580
Bean Seedling.

Beancurd Jelly.

613
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,540
No.

614
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,410
Bean Pudding sounds too old-fashioned.

615
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,750
I'll call it Beancurd Jelly.

616
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,030
Beancurd Jelly sounds domineering.

617
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,920
But it's still not that domineering.

618

Bean Bun.

619

Why are you drinking alone?

622
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,860
I'm going home after doing some shopping.

If the key is twisted reversely,

682
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,670
you can twist it back.

Looks like you're not drunk.

You did mew.

Robin!

What's up?

690
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,730
Why are you here so late?

Robin!

Let me ask you again.

693
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,250
Do you want to be with me?

694
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,540
I really like you.

695
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,660
I told you

696
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,040
we were not suitable for each other.

697
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,550
You don't have a girlfriend.

698

And I don't have a boyfriend.

When two people are together,

love can be cultivated.

I can also like you.

702
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,260
Your mom has been urging you, right?

703
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,070
I've told you

I don't like you.

Robin, what's wrong?

706
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,880
Aren't we happy together?

707
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,260
You even went to the exhibition with me.

708
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,200
We went to

709

so many delicious restaurants together.

710
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,690
You even took me beautiful photos.

Is it up to you?

Does Robin know you?

717

I'll give you three choices now.

One.

726

Get out drunk.

727
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,050
Two.

728
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,880
Get out sober.

729
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,420
Three.

730
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,960
I'll ask someone to carry you out.

731
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,230
Fine.

732

Forget what I said.

I wish you all the best.

Let's have dinner next time.

735
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,860
You saw me in the museum.

736

Why didn't you say hi?

737
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,910

I have a favor to ask.

746
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,100
What is it? Want me to appraise something?

747

It's free.

No.

749
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,180
I'm looking for someone.

750
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,820
No problem.

751

It's okay.

I have a lot of resources here.

How many are you looking for?

754

One or a few?

755
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,940
One is enough.

handwriting appraiser?

758

I looked it up online,

but I feel uneasy about the results.

760

After thinking about it,

761
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,050
I think I'd better ask you to recommend one for me.

762
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,210
The person must be reliable.

It doesn't matter if the price is higher.

No.

Why don't I become an intermediary agent?
