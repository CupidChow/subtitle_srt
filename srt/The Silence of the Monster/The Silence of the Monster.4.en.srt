There's another approach.

00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,920
You can never thank me enough

7
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,229
for what I'm doing for you.

8
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:52,860
Here we go.

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,979

I found it!

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,980
They're all asleep.

13
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,280
In this era,

14
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,020
it's impossible to remove all your traces

15
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,930
on the Internet.

Although his QQ account

21
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,060

But God's ways are higher than our ways.

26
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,300
He probably didn't expect

27
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,460
that some fan still remembers him

28
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,100
though he has been away for so long.

29
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,110
Look.

30
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,930
It's been a long time.

31
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,310
Why do you stop updating?

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,410
I like your work the most.

33
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,420
They are high quality products

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,880
at affordable prices.

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,200
This is promising.

Li Jun,

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,510
explain your account on the forum.

Officer,

39
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,380
I really don't know what you're talking about.

Chufeng.

42
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,110
Brother Chufeng.

43
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,150
Chufeng.

44
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,430
Chufeng.

45
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,180
Chufeng.

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,140
Chufeng.

47
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:55,920
Hello.

48
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,540
He is already at the police station.

49
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,900
Our investigation has shown

50
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,280
that he has another property

51
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,300
under a relative's name.

52
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,260
A safe is hidden inside that property.

53
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,230
We suspect

54
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,690
the direct evidence to convict him

55
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,130
is hidden in this safe.

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,890
We have to let him go in an hour.

57
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,060
And he has booked

58
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,210
a flight to Canada in three hours.

59
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,340
But this lock...

60
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,810
You'll know when you're here.

61
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,010
Fancy seeing you again.

62
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,580
Don't be nervous. Relax.

63
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,340
Or it's bad for your stomach.

64
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,350
Since I was young,

65
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,640
I've got a way of relieving stress:

66
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,180
putting bad guys in jail.

67
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,020
Well, it's a shame.

68
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,150
Because this time,

69
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,800
I can't help you with that.

70
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,930
How's it going?

71
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,670
It has 5 pins in total.

72
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,300
Can you do this?

73
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,190
How long will it take?

74
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,120
How much longer will it take?

75
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,050
Please let me work alone in here.

76
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

77
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,840
It seems like he's gonna open it soon.

78
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,700
Is it open?

79
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,220
It... It seems like it is not open.

80
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,270
Well, it has been two hours.

81
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,670
Does it always take so long to unlock a safe?

82
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,540
Didn't you say he's amazing?

83
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,160
So annoying.

84
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,460
Do you know how long

85
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,700
an average locksmith will need

86
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,060
to open this

87
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,820
without a password and key?

88
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,660
How long?

89
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,510
At least 10 hours.

90
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,000
We won't be able to make it.

91
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:08,820
Don't worry.

92
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,520
Our Chufeng

93
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,800
is not an average locksmith.

94
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,460
Fifty-two minutes left.

95
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,260
Mr. Li,

96
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,380
can I get you anything?

97
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,160
A bottle of soda.

98
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,620
Sure.

99
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,740
A moment, please, Mr. Li.

100
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,660
I'll get that for you right away.

101
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,390
This is the pre-boarding announcement

102
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,240
for flightflight CA7259 to Vancouver.

103
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200
Please get ready.

104
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,120
Li Jun,

105
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,600
you're under arrest for invasion of privacy.

106
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,320
You are now summonsed.

107
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,310
Sui Yi, you're here.

108
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,130
Officer Xiao Guo. Officer Chen.

109
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,530
Young counselor.

110
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,680
you came here so quickly.

111
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,980
Didn't I call you

112
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,940
only ten minutes ago?

113
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,370
We've started interrogating him.

114
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,390
He won't be able to escape this time.

115
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,440
He's so shameless.

116
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,640
Will he confess?

117
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,300
Whether he confesses or not,

118
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,010
we can convict him

119
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,260
based on the evidence we have now

120
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,450
even if he doesn't plead guilty.

121
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,660
Let's go.

122
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,700
Well,

123
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,150
have you found the videos?

124
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,550
Don't worry about the videos.

125
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,660
Our cyber policemen

126
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,220
have thoroughly examined the surveillance cameras

127
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,260
found in the apartment

128
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,620
you rented before.

129
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,420
The signal sources inside have disappeared long ago.

130
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,850
Therefore, they cannot

131
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,980
store or transfer data.

132
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,020
So don't worry.

133
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,100
For real?

134
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,580
Yes.

135
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,200
Don't worry about it anymore.

136
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,150
Alright.

137
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,920
I should go to the Municipal Bureau to assist the investigation.

138
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,060
I'll let you know

139
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,020
as soon as we have the result.

140
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,240
Chufeng,

141
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,680
you saved the day.

142
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,100
Come with me.

143
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,130
Sui Yi,

144
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,610
have a seat.

145
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,240
Sui Yi,

146
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,360
don't worry.

147
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,470
Chief Chen will investigate this case thoroughly.

148
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,290
Thank you, Officer Xiao Guo.

149
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,380
I'm glad you're okay.

150
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,820
All right, it's done.

151
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,470
See? I told you.

152
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,770
We got this. Absolutely.

153
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,250
Do you believe me now?

154
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,600
That's not what you said.

155
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,020
I think we made it this time

156
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,720
because of Mr. He.

157
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,480
So he really is extraordinary.

158
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,480
Let's go.

159
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,570
Let's go home for dinner.

160
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,940
I'm heading out.

161
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,910
Bye.

162
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,300
Let's go.

163
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,320
Is it okay that you didn't go to work today?

164
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,170
It's fine. I took a personal day.

165
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,460
Though you had a personal matter,

166
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,750
but as your senior,

167
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,100
I have to remind you

168
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,790
that it's a cruel world out there.

169
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,980
But you were trying your best

170
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,130
to help me.

171
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,520
How could I just go to work?

172
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,050
You didn't see the techniques

173
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,940
He Chufeng used today.

174
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,560
Did you break the record this time?

175
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,520
My car!

176
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,100
You're very tired.

177
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,100
Take a break.

178
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,980
Teach me how to cook it.

179
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,710
Then I'll take it from here.

180
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,270
Okay.

181
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,260
I've prepared the seasoning.

182
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,460
Wash the tomatoes and potatoes.

183
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,310
Chop the potatoes into chunks.

184
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,080
The beef has been boiled.

185
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,670
Just wait 40 minutes,

186
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,090
and then add the potatoes to the soup

187
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,560
with the seasoning.

188
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,730
Put the lid on and stew it for 3 minutes.

189
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,950
Add the tomatoes after that.

190
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,230
Let me know when it's done.

191
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,130
Okay.

192
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,330
Are you sure you can do this?

193
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,440
Yes.

194
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,290
Good.

195
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,000
Chop the potatoes and tomatoes into chuncks.

196
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,430
Okay. Here.

197
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,650
♫The breeze is brushing my weary face♫

198
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,690
♫Looking at the stars, under the moonlight♫

199
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,530
♫Suddenly I have too many thoughts♫

200
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,280
♫It's almost midnight♫

201
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,860
♫I can't sleep at all♫

202
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,330
♫Hey, it's all right. No more sighing♫

203
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,100
♫The clouds will be gone when the sun comes up♫

204
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,320
♫The Milky Way is endless. Take a deep breath♫

205
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,970
♫One planet is so far away from another♫

206
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,600
♫Why are we so childish?♫

207
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,040
♫I folded the answer in the paper plane♫

208
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,610
♫Acting like I don't care♫

209
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:45,400
♫I've got many secrets♫

210
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,630
♫I want to lie under the moonlight with you♫

211
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,820
♫The light wind is like your breath♫

212
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,000
It's the kitchen timer.

213
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,820
♫I want to melt into the dreams with you♫

214
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,850
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,760
♫And listen to our heartbeats that are in sync♫

216
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,410
♫The rush of happiness comes so suddenly♫

217
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,610
♫Every look of yours will move me♫

218
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,800
♫Your gentle eyes are intoxicating♫

219
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,480
♫I've fell for you, without knowing it♫

220
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,110
♫My heart is beating wildly♫

221
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,370
Rib soup with tomatoes and potatoes .

222
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,300
It must've been stewed for an hour and a half.

223
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,980
Which means you've looked for your car for an hour and a half.

224
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,590
Was there no parking space?

225
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,460
Finally, we don't have to order takeout today.

226
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:58,650
Sui Yi,

227
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,960
I'm so glad you're here.

228
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,610
Tell us what you want to eat anytime.

229
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,140
Our He Chufeng

230
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,020
is a chef behind closed doors.

231
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,960
He'll learn dishes that he can't cook.

232
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,340
It is definitely worthy of your rent.

233
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,630
So impressive.

234
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,700
By the way,

235
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,410
who will give me the lease to sign on?

236
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,850
Don't worry about it.

237
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,900
Granny Mi likes you very much.

238
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,090
I'll remind her when she comes to the store.

239
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,640
Can't you take care of that?

240
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,830
Yes.

241
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,080
I'll call her when I'm done.

242
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,350
We need to do it formally after all.

243
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,800
Thank you so much.

244
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,330
And how are we going to pay for our meals?

245
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:50,850
Pay for our meals?

246
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,390
Yeah.

247
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,770
We live in a shared house.

248
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,050
Do we eat together

249
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,510
or separately?

250
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,100
If we eat together like right now,

251
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,140
should we split the expenses?

252
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,050
Why haven't I thought of that before?

253
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,250
He Chufeng,

254
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,930
I've eaten your food for free for a year.

255
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,980
Let's do the math now.

256
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,550
There are 365 days in a year.

257
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,140
I would charge you 40 yuan each day.

258
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,330
It will be 14,600 yuan in total.

259
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,800
I will deduct the procurement cost for you.

260
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,470
I feel deeply sorry for my behavior.

261
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,150
But how could you bill me?

262
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,790
Sui Yi, you are right.

263
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,500
I think

264
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,700
I'm gonna

265
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
pay for my bill first.

266
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,840
And then we will split the expenses.

267
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,290
No, no, no. That won't do.

268
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,780
I must pay.

269
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,070
How about you pay for Chufeng's glasses first?

270
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,190
I'm sorry.

271
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,550
I'll pay for that as soon as I get my salary.

272
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,540
Let's eat dinner.

273
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,780
Stop talking about money.

274
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,820
Why do I feel so strange?

275
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,910
By the way,

276
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,220
how did you learn martial arts?

277
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,970
I was trained when I was young.

278
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,090
You were?

279
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,780
My grandpa trained me, for my self protection.

280
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,440
But I've always fought for unjustly treated people

281
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,350
since I was little.

282
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,380
I fight the bully

283
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,950
whenever I see bullying.

284
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,900
Later I went to college, majored in law.

285
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,820
And I started to change, gradually.

286
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,590
We need to be reasonable no matter what happens.

287
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,470
Don't fight immediately.

288
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,740
That's why we can't mess with her.

289
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,350
Let's talk nicely.

290
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,490
And don't fight if it's possible.

291
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,440
Do you have other specialties?

292
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,910
Such as cooking.

293
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,070
I can make noodle soup.

294
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,630
It's an essential skill for self-reliance.

295
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,870
I can do that too.

296
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,110
Here.

297
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,790
Let's take a picture together,

298
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,010
to celebrate Sui Yi officially moving into Monster Vintage.

299
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:06,860
OK.

300
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,500
I'll send it to you.

301
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,870
How did you know each other?

302
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:21,930
We?

303
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:22,970
We were childhood sweethearts.

304
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,750
We went to the same high school.

305
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,210
I was not your childhood sweetheart.

306
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,260
No wonder you always call him your schoolmate.

307
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,180
You're going to wash the dishes.

308
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,330
Why me, again?

309
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,650
I'll do it.

310
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,650
No, let him do it.

311
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,290
I'll do half of it, and you'll finish the rest.

312
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,970
I'll wash the dishes and you'll clean the pot.

313
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,180
I don't like

314
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,450
doing half of a job.

315
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,450
You just ruined

316
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,030
our newly created, pleasant

317
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,100
living environment.

318
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,810
You can go do the dishes and create it again.

319
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,970
I'll do it.

320
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,670
-Girls shouldn't do the dishes. - Girls shouldn't do the dishes.

321
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,120
I'll do it today and you'll do it tomorrow.

322
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,360
I'll cook tomorrow.

323
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,150
Let's buy a dishwasher.

324
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,020
A dishwasher is not as good as hand washing.

325
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,690
You need to believe in the power of technology.

326
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,510
Yeah, I do.

327
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,260
I just want to see you washing the dishes.

328
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,380
Please feel sorry for your housemate.

329
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,780
The case of Su Xiaoyue's stalker

330
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,750
is still ongoing.

331
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,820
According to netizens,

332
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,910
the stalker is a top 10 high-school graduate

333
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,350
from Guangming County in Chaonan City.

334
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,340
He has also been admitted

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,080
Many netizens who know him

338
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,770
are very shocked.

339
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,740
He's a model student

340
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,710
who always has excellent grades.

341
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,620
Although he's an introvert,

342
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,780
he's friendly

343
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,140
and get along with classmates.

344
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,510
[A model student would do such a thing] [Exclusive]

345
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,250
They can't believe

346
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,180
he would do such a thing.

347
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,730
She used a password lock for her apartment.

348
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,670
I assumed that passwords

349
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,420
are usually birthdays.

350
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,360
I did some research

351
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,770
and tried her dad's birthday.

352
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,630
Surprisingly, the door opened.

353
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,400
But this time,

354
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,250
I tried many passwords but failed.

355
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,730
I found out that she changed it to a fingerprint lock.

356
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,020
An expert in the industry has done experiments.

357
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:01,480
[It's risky to take photos with scissors hands]

358
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,620
The photo of scissors hands taken within 1.5 meters

359
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,130
can be used to recreate the complete

360
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,470
fingerprints of the photographer.

361
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,980
Within 1.5 to 3 meters,

[Fingerprints in photos can be copied within 3 meters]

363

fifty percent of the fingerprints can be recreated.

364
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,020
It would be hard to get the fingerprints

365
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,300
only when the photos are taken more than 3 meters away.

366
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,900
What?

367
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,180
Xiaoyue is missing?

368
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
Her company contacted me.

369
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,620
They think it has something to do with you.

370
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,020
It doesn't matter whether they suspect me or not.

371
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,010
What's important is why Xiaoyue is missing.

372
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,650
Did she go into hiding?

373
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,280
Or something happen to her?

374
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,820
Her company can't reach her right now.

375
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Don't you have her contact details?

376
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,730
Try to contact her now.

377
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,150
Inform me immediately if you hear anything.

378
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,330
Don't act on your own again.

379
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,510
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

380
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,630
Please spare my son this time.

381
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,230
My son gave her a bracelet as a gift.

382
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,930
Look, this is the bracelet.

383
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,480
It cost him 3,000 yuan.

384
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,380
If she doesn't like my son,

385
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,420
why would she accept a gift from him?

386
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,690
The Internet is really terrible.

387
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,740
It's so volatile.

388
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,220
Did you know long ago

389
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,780
how he got Su Xiaoyue's fingerprint?

390
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,240
Sui Yi, from now on,

391
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,770
don't make a "V" sign with your fingers

392
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:04,710
when taking photos.

393
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,210
Can you

394
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,950
do me a favor?

395
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,180
Hello.

396
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,520
Are you Su Xiaoyue's father?

397
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,160
I don't know you.

398
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,710
Look.

399
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,180
Her father's response could mean

400
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,530
Su Xiaoyue didn't go to see him.

401
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,200
Where else would she go?

402
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,340
Is other people's issue

403
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,950
more important than yours?

404
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,090
Although Xiaoyue is my idol,

405
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,620
a person who was out of my reach,

406
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,140
after what happened these days,

407
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,900
I find that she is just

408
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,150
a fragile girl.

409
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,700
She has her fear

410
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,670
and grievance.

411
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,830
Sometimes I feel that we're much alike.

412
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,340
We've been through horrible things

413
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,010
and suffered misunderstandings and hurt.

414
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,070
I'm getting support and protection

415
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:41,810
from you guys.

416
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,260
But Xiaoyue has no one

417
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,680
she can rely on.

418
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,570
I've been to the place

419
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,760
of helplessness.

420
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,000
So I know how sad she must feel.

421
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,910
I have to help her.

422
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,640
We'll find her

423
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,910
and figure out everything.

424
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,750
Xiaoyue,

425
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,170
how was your day?

426
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,500
Things must have been hard for you.

427
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,820
That's why you went into hiding.

428
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,510
Sometimes you get so much attention

429
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,910
from so many people.

430
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,470
You must have heard a lot of beautiful words,

431
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,020
as well as many nasty comments.

432
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,610
During the days you're away,

433
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,760
will you be able

434
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,630
to sleep well?

435
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,250
You once posted on Weibo,

436
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,540
saying you were going to make your debut.

437
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,690
And you were going to bury your heart.

438
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,570
But that's a young girl's heart.

439
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,010
It's your brilliant,

440
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,440
warm heart.

441
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,210
Burying it

442
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,090
doesn't mean it's gone.

443
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,400
You bury it

444
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,540
to help it grow.

445
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,620
Right?

446
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,880
I hope you are safe

447
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:12,990
during the time you're away.

448
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,240
And find yourself.

I saved my money in it for a year.

That's none of my business.

475
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,219
Su Xiaoyue is only

a product to them.

477
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:16,650
They can still manage

I am not even there,

481
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,310
but still, I could post "see you tomorrow".

482
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,980
But you're more than

483
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,480
a personality to us.

484
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,060
You are a real person,

whom we truly like.

486
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:50,949
An authentic person.

487
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:51,900
Who are you?

488
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,659
Are you the ones hiding under my bed,

489
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,020
and peeping into my life?

490
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,300
Or the ones saying they like me online

491
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,440
and defaming me at the same time?

492
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,200
Or someone who reveal the details

493
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,510
of my life to the public?

494
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:07,940
Authentic?

495
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,750
Do you think that's authentic?

496
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,810
Even I don't think so myself.

497
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,040
So don't like me anymore.

498
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,340
July 28, 2018.

499
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,570
It was a typhoon day.

500
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,800
On a simple stage in the mall,

501
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,480
you were a backup dancer in the corner.

502
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,980
The light didn't even shine on you,

503
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,340

September 15, 2018,

506
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,250
Star Moon Girls debuted their first single.

507
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,940
You said thank you to every fan

509
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,420
On March 4, 2019,

510
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,730
you had your first individual interview.

511
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,990
You said you were the happiest

512
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,740
when you were on stage.

513
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,830
On May 12, 2019.

514
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,700
Your first fan meetup.

515
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,790
You prepared small gifts

516
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,400
and hand-written cards

517
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,930
for everyone who was present.

518
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,170
That card has been an encouragement to me since then.

519
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,540
Thank you for your love.

520
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,360
I'll work harder.

521
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,300
I hope we can move forward

522
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,150
to our dreams.

523
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,560
Never give up.

524
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,280
Let's become better person

525
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,930
and be proud of each other.

526

I don't know how many hardships you've been through.

527
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,440
And I don't know how much effort

528
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,560
you've made for your dream.

529
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,990
But I know

530
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,460
that girl who gives a hundred percent

531
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,900
for every performance.

532
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,200
The girl who glows

533
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,880
as soon as she stands on the stage.

534
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:40,920
That is Su Xiaoyue.

535
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,760
The real Su Xiaoyue.

536
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
You may not know

537
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,420
that during the time I couldn't find you,

538
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,740
the most terrible thing

539
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,300
also happened in my life.

540
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,370
Someone installed a pinhole camera at my apartment.

541
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,630
That thing did real-time transmission on the Internet.

542
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,840
I wandered around on streets,

543
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,550
but had nowhere to go.

544
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,850
I looked through the contacts on my phone,

545
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,220
but couldn't find anyone to talk to.

546
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,750
I didn't dare to call my family.

547
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,690
I could only lie in the bed in a small hotel,

548
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,890
not even knowing what to do the next day.

549
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,300
At some point,

550
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,390
I wondered if my life was over.

551
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,030
But at that moment, I thought of you.

552
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,340
You're going through something even scarier.

553
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,030
You're under more pressure.

554
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,320
But still, the dawn broke.

555
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,200
And I found a new home.

556
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,930
I met friends who try their best

557
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,050
to help me.

558
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,780
And the bad guy who hurt me

559
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,630
got the punishment he deserves.

560

so Su Xiaoyue's life will do too.

562
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,460
No matter what choices you make,

563
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,950
I will always respect

564
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,150
and support you.

As your long-term housemate,

568
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,920
I think we need to have a discussion

569
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,740
about our rules.

570
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,960
I have high tolerance for you,

571
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,490
but it doesn't mean I would spoil you.

572
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,410
Your tone makes me

00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,230
feel like a child being lectured.

Indeed.

00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,120
I feel like an old father now.

576
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,650
If you can't change your attitude,

577
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,010
then don't talk.

578

I suddenly feel like I'm your same-age, close friend.

It's such a nice day today.

We can't take it for granted.

Please keep your sentiment inside.

582
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,510
I have so many heavy thoughts of life.

583

Keeping them inside would be too much for me.

to get more fans.

587

Set up an account for tips.

Write about yourself. Don't bring me along.

I think it's Ye Wenjie.

Wei Cheng is smarter

because he always has great sense of
