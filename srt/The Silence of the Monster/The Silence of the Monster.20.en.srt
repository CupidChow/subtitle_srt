00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,280
What destiny?

8
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,700
Men are all chameleons.

9
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,130
We've only been in a relationship for three days,

10
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,880
and I can't even find him.

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,380
What three days?

12
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,240
I mean, you've been here for three days.

13
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,570
An, come here.

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,199
You can sleep on the bed tonight.

15
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,850
No, thanks.

16
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,480
It's nice of you to let me stay here.

17
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,300
I can sleep on the floor.

18
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,590
No, no, no.

19
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,140
You're injured.

20
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,220
You need to have a good rest.

21
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:19,880
I'm fine.

22
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,350
I can sleep on the floor.

23
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,850
I've changed the bedsheet and quilt cover for you.

24
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,810
I've prepared a few more clothes.

25
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,040
See if they fit you.

26
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,640
Thank you.

27
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,579
Go to sleep.

28
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,310
The world

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,910
changes so fast.

30
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,170
Sometimes you think

31
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,640
you know something quite well.

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,920
But in the end, you just can't keep up to date.

33
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,780
You've changed a lot over the past two years.

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,310
You've become taller

35
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
and more handsome

36
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,930
but talk less.

37
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,160
You're like a man of few words.

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,800
You're nagging a lot though.

39
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,070
I was bored

40
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,720
when I was back in there.

41
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,660
When I was free,

42
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,980
I would talk to myself,

43
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,870
so I've become chatty after a while.

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,950
Isn't that good?

45
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,560
It's good.

46
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,070
What did you tell me

47
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,170
you do for a living last time?

48
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,750
Selling antiques?

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,160
Actually,

50
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,630
I'm a locksmith.

51
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,870
It's good.

52
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,170
Being a locksmith...

53
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,860
It's really good.

54
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,190
It's good.

55
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,220
Really.

56
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,860
You usually overthink.

57
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,550
You could have just told me last time.

58
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,530
I'm fine.

59
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,800
It's good to be a locksmith.

60
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,550
Besides, you are so talented.

61
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,520
I finally have a successor.

62
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,420
But no matter how much the world changes,

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,210
there are still a lot of misunderstandings

64
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,200
about locksmith.

65
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,500
It's the way

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,840
it is.

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,840
People like to judge others

68
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,870
depending on their biases.

69
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,100
But you are better

70
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,340
than me on that.

71
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,500
You can handle it.

72
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,090
Cheers

73
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,590
to your career.

74
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,050
Do you want to

75
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,659
come to my studio?

76
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,970
You have a studio?

77
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,540
Okay.

78
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,650
Great!

79
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,790
I...

80
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,700
I... I have to go check it out.

81
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,570
It's too late today.

82
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,420
Give me your address.

83
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,320
I'll go tomorrow.

84
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,850
Okay.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm sending you the address.

86
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,000
My phone is dead.

87
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,610
I'll send it to you later.

88
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,500
Studio.

89
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:40,880
Cheers.

90
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,560
Sui Yi,

91
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,200
are you asleep?

92
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,220
Not yet.

93
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,260
I can't fall asleep.

94
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,340
Is anything bothering you?

95
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,380
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

96
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,980
Just stay here.

97
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,340
Tell me if you need anything.

98
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,170
I'll let you know immediately

99
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,860
if they find anything.

100
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,210
Sometimes I feel

101
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,700
if I can't remember anything,

102
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,550
it will be good though.

103
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,480
Every time when I tried hard to recall,

104
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,340
there was a vague figure

105
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,690
in my head.

106
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,500
I don't know who he was.

107
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,060
He was tall and scary.

108
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,330
I wanted to see him clearly,

109
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,060
but he kept pressing my chest

110
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,430
and I couldn't breathe.

111
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,280
There's a voice in my mind that keeps telling me

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,700
if I know something,

113
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,240
I will encounter something terrible.

114
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,890
I don't know why.

115
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,500
Don't be afraid.

116
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,460
You're safe here.

117
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll protect you,

118
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,760
and Robin...

119
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,500
He'll protect you too.

120
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,390
Sleep tight.

121
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,070
[You must be asleep.]

122
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,780
[I'm sorry. My phone ran out of battery.]

123
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,780
[Good night.]

124
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:42,300
[It's okay. Good night.]

125
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,500
How is it going?

126
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,670
Almost done.

127
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,410
Get up.

128
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,320
Let me sleep.

129
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,370
Get up.

130
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,540
It's Sunday.

131
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,960
Why did you wake me up so early?

132
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,150
Come on.

133
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,650
The purple you like.

134
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,510
What did you say?

135
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,070
We're cleaning today.

136
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,250
No, the one before that.

137
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,580
When did I say I like purple?

138
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,450
Did Sui Yi say that?

139
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,300
She just knew me.

140
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,640
How could she know my preferences?

141
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,090
We're cleaning today.

142
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,690
OK. I'll call Sui Yi.

143
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,540
You can do it alone.

144
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,460
Why?

145
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,810
Since it's a cleaning,

146
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,230
we should all be there.

147
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,410
We had a deal.

148
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,380
Why doesn't she need to attend?

149
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,460
He Chufeng, you're so biased.

150
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,190
Then ask An to come down as well.

151
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:47,870
Okay.

152
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100
I'll do my best to clean.

153
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,660
You have 30 minutes.

154
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,060
Clean the garden.

155
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,450
Put away the Christmas tree.

156
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,230
Everything needs to be back to normal.

157
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,030
You have 29 minutes and 46 seconds left.

158
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,610
What 29 minutes?

159
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,930
At least 40 minutes.

160
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,010
It will take me 21 minutes

161
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,980
to clean up the Christmas tree.

162
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,900
Even a robot can't finish in that short time.

163
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,780
28 minutes and 46 seconds left.

164
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,630
I don't care. Give it back.

165
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,980
He Chufeng

166
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,570
No way.

167
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,650
What are you doing?

168
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:19,900
It's him.

169
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,610
It's none of my business.

170
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,610
What's wrong with you lately?

171
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,890
You got up so early everyday.

172
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,080
Are you trying to turn over a new leaf

173
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,950
and start over?

174
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,310
Don't bother me.

175
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,260
I don't have much time.

176
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,010
I don't know why.

177
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,330
I don't know who's coming today.

178
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,990
It's all because of you.

179
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,220
I can't finish tidying up the Christmas tree.

180
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,410
It's none of my business.

181
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,880
Because you asked that question,

182
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,840
you wasted 30 seconds of my time.

183
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,030
Stop talking to me.

184
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,560
What's wrong with him?

185
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,100
Do you need help?

186
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,130
Let's leave him alone.

187
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,180
He doesn't have

188
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,100
much time.

189
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,140
Besides, he needs peace.

190
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,140
You need to concentrate

191
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,330
no matter what you're doing.

192
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,420
What do you want for breakfast?

193
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,570
Anything.

194
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,460
You really don't need help?

195
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,180
What's your plan today?

196
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,320
A friend of mine

197
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,880
is coming to my studio today.

198
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,470
Your friend?

199
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,720
When is he coming?

200
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,390
Do we need to prepare anything?

201
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,380
Hold on. Give me five minutes.

202
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:34,980
Morning.

203
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,390
Morning.

204
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,340
What's wrong?

205
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,420
I'm gonna go get changed.

206
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:40,810
Morning.

207
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:46,930
Morning.

208
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,630
Morning, An.

209
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,350
Do you want to listen to music?

210
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,320
You have 26 minutes left.

211
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,250
It's okay.

212
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,040
I'm willing to spend time on you.

213
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,770
You have 25 minutes and 54 seconds.

214
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Do you want to listen to music?

215
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,160
The speaker is over there.

216
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,660
Breakfast is ready.

217
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,140
It's on the table.

218
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,020
Let me help you.

219
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,720
No, thanks.

220
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,190
Just watch.

221
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,980
There's more here.

222
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,610
Do you need help?

223
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,650
Five minutes are not enough.

224
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,620
This bear

225
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,060
is too big here.

226
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,770
How about I take it back to the room?

227
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,500
You want to take it back to your room?

228
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,540
It does seem a little big.

229
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,610
But I think it's cute.

230
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,180
I think it's very cute when smiling.

231
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,290
Its hair is fluffy.

232
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,820
Since you like it,

233
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,790
just leave it here.

234
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,660
You have five minutes and 36 seconds left.

235
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,380
If you don't help,

236
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,180
don't get in the way here.

237
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,230
Go sit on the couch.

238
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,090
Hurry up.

239
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,060
An

240
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:45,870
Get in.

241
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,880
Sweep there.

242
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,700
Okay.

243
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,140
I finally finished all the work

244
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,410
in the specified time.

245
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,790
If you hadn't finished

246
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,230
within the specified time,

247
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,960
what would happen?

248
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,590
Nothing would happen.

249
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,460
Then why should I follow his rules?

250
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,360
Am I too kind?

251
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,760
He Chufeng,

252
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,290
I've fallen in your trap again.

253
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,420
Granny.

254
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,610
It's so clean.

255
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,390
Granny, you're here.

256
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,570
I did it all by myself.

257
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,370
You did a good job, Chufeng.

258
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,910
I did all these.

259
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Why did you compliment him?

260
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,860
If it weren't for Chufeng,

261
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,940
I'm afraid

262
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,260
you would still be in bed now.

263
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,350
You know him well.

264
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,850
An, are you ready?

265
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,010
Granny.

266
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,260
Are you going out with An?

267
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,860
Don't ask about

268
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,050
women's stuff.

269
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,220
What about Sui Yi?

270
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,350
I know.

271
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,220
But I've got something else to do.

272
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,810
I'm the only one who doesn't know?

273
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,430
He Chufeng, you knew it?

274
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,720
I know now.

275
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,710
We're gonna go.

276
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,450
Be careful.

277
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,050
Move aside.

278
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,140
So,

279
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,740
why are you with me in the end?

280
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,060
Do you think I can dress up like this?

281
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,770
What should I say later?

282
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,500
What type of girl do you want me to pretend to be?

283
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,260
Quiet, virtuous,

284
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,250
or smart?

285
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,060
Suit yourself.

286
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,410
Fine.

287
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,660
Is He Chufeng's friend here?

288
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:28,900
Hello.

289
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,140
This is Gu Nan.

290
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,260
This is Robin.

291
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,500
This is Sui Yi.

292
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,970
We live here together.

293
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,230
Have a seat.

294
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,080
Okay.

295
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,360
Where should I sit?

296
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,800
Here.

297
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,720
There you go.

298
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,850
Thank you.

299
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,330
Sorry for bothering you.

300
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,580
Hello, Mr. Gu.

301
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,830
May I ask

302
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,400
what you do for a living?

303
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,950
He's my master.

304
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,750
That's great.

305
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,630
So big.

306
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,490
So bright.

307
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,920
I didn't expect

308
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,300
you would make the lock shop look like this.

309
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,280
I moved in last year.

310
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,880
Look at this.

311
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,450
It's so fashionable.

312
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,940
It's much better than our previous one.

313
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,140
Chufeng,

314
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,180
you're smart.

315
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,640
You young people are creative

316
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,910
and enthusiastic.

317
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,610
We are too old

318
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,040
to do it anymore.

319
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,980
I'm out.

320
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,560
This is the person you told me

321
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,320
you met in the park?

322
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,900
When I saw them at the police station,

323
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,270
I felt they had a good relationship.

324
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,760
It turns out he's his teacher.

325
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,780
That makes sense.

326
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,260
But why do I feel a little strange?

327
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,580
Strange?

328
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,050
Why?

329
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,740
My instinct.

330
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,100
Before he came,

331
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,580
He Chufeng had prepared too much.

332
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,800
It's totally different from before.

333
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,090
It's normal.

334
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,580
This is his teacher.

335
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,120
A teacher

336
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,230
is like one's father forever.

337
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,580
No.

338
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,980
Based on what I know about He Chufeng,

339
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,620
it's not that simple.

340
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,480
Based on your understanding of He Chufeng,

341
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,770
why is it not that simple?

342
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,480
He has a habit.

343
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,180
He doesn't drink any water

344
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,640
in front of someone he doesn't fully trust.

345
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,370
Really?

346
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,720
But he mentioned this person to me

347
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,080
unintentionally.

348
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,200
He said someone helped him

349
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,180
when he just moved to Zhaonuan.

350
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,430
He must be talking about this teacher.

351
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,330
How are you living now?

352
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,140
Do you need my help,

353
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,520
or do you need me to help you find a place nearby?

354
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,550
We'll live closer then.

355
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,580
We can take care of each other.

356
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,890
The people here are nice

357
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,270
and friendly.

358
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,970
It is convenient to live here.

359
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,710
Don't worry.

360
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,020
Are you pitying me?

361
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,980
I don't need your charity.

362
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,830
I know

363
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,720
you feel sorry for me.

364
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,300
From the moment I entered this room,

365
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,250
I could feel

366
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,590
you want to

367
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,740
say sorry to me.

368
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,710
But it's not necessary.

369
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,400
You didn't do anything wrong.

370
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,960
Your choice has always been right.

371
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,580
I did something wrong.

372
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,530
I've thought it through

373
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,880
when I was back in there.

374
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,670
Since I'm out,

375
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,440
let bygones be bygones.

376
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,480
Let's start over.

377
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,480
I'm sorry.

378
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,760
No, don't.

379
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,990
Why are you worried about me?

380
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,620
I have hands and feet.

381
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,470
I can work.

382
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,200
I won't starve.

383
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,880
If he's really his teacher,

384
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,230
he must be very capable.

385
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,340
He must be a locksmith nearby.

386
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,410
No.

387
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,940
He never mentioned him.

388
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,670
Besides, if he lives around here,

389
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,780
why hadn't he shown up for so long?

390
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,850
When they met that day,

391
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,340
Chufeng was quite surprised.

392
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,300
Should I get them some food

393
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:20,940
and take it upstairs?

394
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,780
If they haven't seen each other for a long time,

395
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,780
they must have a lot to talk about.

396
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,600
Okay.

397
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,040
Are you going out?

398
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,900
There's a garage that can't be opened.

399
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm gonna go check it out.

400
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,140
Help me take care of him.

401
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,860
I'll be right back.

402
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,780
No, no, no.

403
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,340
I'll go with you.

404
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,090
You stay here.

405
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,010
Let's eat together when I'm back.

406
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,460
They are all friends.

407
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,840
Make yourself at home.

408
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,330
Right, Mr. Gu.

409
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,450
Make yourself at home.

410
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,340
Chufeng's teacher is our teacher.

411
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,160
Go ahead.

412
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,260
We'll treat him well.

413
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:49,910
Go ahead.

414
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,290
Here.

415
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,170
Mr. Gu, have a seat.

416
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,730
Have a seat.

417
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,770
Sorry for bothering you.

418
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,370
It's okay.

419
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,190
I'm gonna go get some fruits.

420
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:12,970
Thank you.

421
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,380
I've told you everything I know.

422
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
I see.

423
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,880
What's your plan next?

424
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,820
I don't know what to do.

425
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,340
Your family must be worried about you.

426
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,180
The police haven't received any calls

427
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,580
about my disappearance.

428
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,620
I don't think they've realised that.

429
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,690
Or,

430
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,350
they didn't look for me.

431
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,410
Let's wait and see.

432
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,980
Don't worry.

433
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,670
There will be a result.

434
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,460
What if

435
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,780
I can't remember anything?

436
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,370
No matter who you are,

437
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,130
where your home is,

438
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,260
before you want to go back,

439
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,300
you can stay here

440
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,510
safely.

441
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,760
Will it be too much trouble for you?

442
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,540
It's too much trouble for them.

443
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,450
Everything is the best arrangement.

444
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,960
I think they will be happy too.

445
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,100
Sir,

446
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,530
have some fruits.

447
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,720
Chufeng bought these for you.

448
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,730
Chufeng is still the same.

449
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,120
He's always so considerate

450
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:53,910
and thoughtful.

451
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,310
Yes.

452
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,230
He Chufeng is really considerate.

453
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,780
We're also proud of him, right?

454
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,150
Yes.

455
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,600
Chufeng is really nice.

456
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,140
Of course.

457
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,910
How is Big Force?

458
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,680
I haven't contacted her since last time.

459
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,350
I was a little worried.

460
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,850
Last time,

461
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,590
Big Force ran out

462
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,530
because something happened at home.

463
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,650
She's a grown-up now.

464
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,010
Thank you for testifying for her that day.

465
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,240
Otherwise, she would have been wronged a lot.

466
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,990
It's nothing.

467
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,830
Life is

468
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,790
not easy.

469
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,240
Besides, she is a child.

470
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,590
We should help her.

471
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,330
Everyone would do so.

472
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,460
Mr. Gu.

473
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,440
That's what I think.

474
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,710
I'm relieved

475
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,990
seeing Chufeng

476
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,500
have you guys as his friends.

477
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,180
Mr. Gu.

478
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,670
You're such an excellent teacher.

479
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,500
You must have a lot of students, right?

480
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,260
I have only one disciple,

481
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,510
Chufeng.

482
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,370
If he's the only disciple,

483
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,340
you must have put a lot of effort into him.

484
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,730
No wonder Chufeng is so excellent.

485
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,020
That's because Chufeng is talented.

486
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,340
I didn't teach him much.

487
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,440
I stopped being a locksmith a long time ago.

488
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,130
It's a world for you young people now.

489
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,990
Why did you stop being a locksmith?

490
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,690
Look.

491
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:58,800
I can't do it anymore.

492
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,570
Something went wrong.

493
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,820
Did you know Chufeng before?

494
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,740
We were high school classmates.

495
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,030
Why didn't he tell me?

496
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,050
I transferred to another school later.

497
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,860
That's why he didn't mention me.

498
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,940
I see.

499
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:35,990
Okay.

500
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:37,610
Okay.

501
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,940
Chief Chen,

502
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,140
didn't you tell me

503
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,220
He Chufeng ever reported his teacher?

504
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,160
Yes.

505
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,970
What's wrong?

506
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,650
I saw his teacher.

507
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,410
Where?

508
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,960
At the police station.

509
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,520
What?

510
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,330
Well, he didn't do anything wrong.

511
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,020
He just saved a kid.

512
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,370
But I think he's a nice guy.

513
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,700
Besides, there's no hate

514
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,790
between them.

515
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,570
I think he looks kind.

516
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,620
You,

517
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,260
pay attention to him.

518
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,840
Keep an eye on him.

519
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,880
Don't make any more trouble.

520
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,870
When did I make any trouble?

521
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,970
Did I?

522
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,430
I should have said that back then.

523
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,090
He never mentioned you to me,

524
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:57,950
right, Bean Bun?

525
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,230
That was a mistake.

526
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,550
Why am I so stupid?

527
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,260
I'm back.

528
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,110
You’re back.

529
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,730
Mr. Gu said he wouldn't bother you

530
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,620
since you were working.

531
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,700
He has something else to do,

532
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,700
so he went back.

533
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,200
I should have said that earlier.

534
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,680
Why did he buy this?

535
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,600
I told him

536
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,690
I have a cat.

537
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,750
This guy does understand the ways of the world.

538
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,050
Why don't you have any guts?

539
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,300
You're being nice to someone

540
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,620
only because they treat you well?

541
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,070
You're a nose of wax.

542
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,530
Bean Bun.

543
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,400
Just eat. You'll gain weight.

544
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,140
It seems to like it very much.

545
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,500
Are you pitying me?

546
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,660
I don't need your charity.

547
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,290
I know

548
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,280
you feel sorry for me.

549
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,060
It's unnecessary.

550
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,050
You didn't do anything wrong.

551
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,440
Your choice has always been right.

552
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,080
I had thought it through

553
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,770
when I was back in there.

554
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,420
Since I'm out,

555
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,410
let bygones be bygones.

556
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,340
I'm home.

557
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,810
An, you're back.

558
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,469
What took you so long?

559
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,600
Where did you go with Granny?

560
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,440
Granny took me to buy some clothes

561
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,710
and some daily necessities.

562
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,530
You should've brought me with you.

563
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,659
I can carry your things.

564
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,620
But I've already bought it.

565
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,840
I mean next time.

566
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,810
Let's talk about it next time.

567
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,610
But maybe I won't remember it next time.

568
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,980
Give me your phone.

569
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,540
I'm gonna write it down on your memo.

570
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,199
Here.

571
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,719
Okay.

572
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:50,949
Robin.

573
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,699
Before I regain my memory,

574
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,210
can I really stay here?

575
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,430
Of course.

576
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,010
You can stay here as long as you want.

577
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,210
It's safe here,

578
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,360
and I can protect you.

579
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,250
I'll try to remember something.

580
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,820
Don't force it.

581
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,660
Well,

582
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,890
I mean

583
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,420
it takes time

584
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,940
to regain memory.

585
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,260
You can do it step by step.

586
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,450
Take your time to recall. No hurry.

587
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,300
Next time…

588
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:28,820
Call me next time.

589
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,050
Done.

590
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,300
Thank you.

591
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,220
You're welcome.

592
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:44,700
Be careful.

593
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,190
I think I don't know you well.

594
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,530
What else do you want to know?

595
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,020
A lot.

596
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,560
How about this?

597
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,430
Let's play a quick quiz.

598
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,460
You ask me five questions.

599
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,600
I ask you five questions.

600
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,550
Okay.

601
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,110
What colour do you like?

602
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:01,660
Blue.

603
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,340
Do you like short hair or long hair?

604
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,410
What kind of hair do you have?

605
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,260
I have long hair.

606
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Then I like long hair.

607
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,020
Which country would you like to visit the most?

608
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,850
Samoa.

609
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,800
Why?

610
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,240
Is this one of the five questions?

611
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,960
This is on the house.

612
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,690
Because it's the most casual country in the world.

613
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,230
What's you major in college?

614
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,450
Mechanical Engineering.

615
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,610
How many girlfriends did you have?

616
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,970
How many boyfriends did you have?

617
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,130
You haven't answered my question.

618
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,420
You are the first one.

619
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,240
Really?

620
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,060
I don't believe it.

621
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,420
Alright, I'm done.

622
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,060
Now you should answer mine.

623
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
How many boyfriends did you have?

624
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,220
Two.

625
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:53,700
Two?

626
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,000
Did you count me in?

627
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,020
No.

628
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:58,980
Okay.

629
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,950
When was your first relationship?

630
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,330
How long was that relationship? Why did you break up?

631
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,750
These are three questions.

632
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,580
This is on the house.

633
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,470
Okay.

634
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,980
One semester in high school.

635
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,450
I found that he was with me

636
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,470
just to copy my homework.

637
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,010
What about the second one?

638
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,850
Did you hold hands? Did you kiss?

639
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,060
In college, it lasted a week.

640
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,480
Nothing happened.

641
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,310
I don't believe it.

642
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,030
He asked me out everyday.

643
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,720
I thought he was pursuing me.

644
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,180
In the end, I found that

645
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,330
he was actually interested in my roommate.

646
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,120
So you were only flattering yourself.

647
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,790
I wasn't.

648
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,020
Am I flattering myself for our relationship?

649
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,100
You kissed me first.

650
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,500
Okay.

651
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,290
We're pretty much the same.

652
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,410
Who is the same as you?

653
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,780
After all, I had two boyfriends before.

654
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,130
Enough, stop talking.

655
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,920
Go.

656
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,660
Tell me the truth.

657
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,660
Have you really never dated?

658
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,140
No.

659
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,870
Really?

660
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,220
[Monster Notebook]

661
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,100
You must

662
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,440
use facial masks,

663
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,160
but you have to choose it carefully.

664
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,100
You have to choose it depending on your skin type.

665
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:10,660
So we need to know

666
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,420
our skin type first.

667
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,250
Do you know your skin type?

668
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,100
I'm a mixed type.

669
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,220
What type of skin do I have?

670
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,090
I don't know.

671
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,260
You are oily.

672
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,260
Oily?

673
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,650
You are oily.

674
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,100
It's good because you don't wear makeup.

675
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,830
You won't get wrinkles easily.

676
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,670
And you are...

677
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,560
Dry mixed.

678
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,620
T-zone medium oily type.

679
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,300
I'm allergic to alcohol.

680
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,900
An, you know a lot.

681
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,730
Yes.

682
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,500
After we find out

683
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,660
our skin type,

684
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,690
we can choose facial masks.

685
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,300
For example, Jia Xiaoguo,

686
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,500
you have oily skin,

687
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,550
so you have to choose moisturising facial masks.

688
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,300
You'll get pimples if your skin dehydrated.

689
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,740
What about me?

690
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,340
You're a mixed type.

691
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,780
You have to pay attention to T-zone's cleaning

692
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,940
since you work in front of a laptop a lot.

693
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,150
Besides,

694
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,920
you need to keep the corners of your eyes hydrated.

695
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,540
Don't take it lightly

696
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,520
when you're young.

697
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,450
The sooner you take care of your skin, the better.

698
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,390
I want botanic hydration

699
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,340
and an eye mask.

700
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,440
And supplement my cheek with essence.

701
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,680
You need three?

702
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,310
Is that okay?

703
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,530
Sure.

704
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,960
So this is how we should apply the mask.

705
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,000
Women should

706
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,220
take care of themselves.

707
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:22,690
Right.

708
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,260
We must take care of ourselves.

709
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,740
When I go home and have money,

710
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,500
I'll give you some facial masks.

711
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,400
It's very useful.

712
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,310
No problem.

713
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,300
I think

714
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,620
nothing is as practical as facial masks.

715
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,480
Can we start now?

716
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,110
No.

717
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,020
Be careful about the right steps

718
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,780
of applying a mask.

719
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,950
First, clean face.

720
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,980
Remember,

721
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,470
exfoliate your skin once a week,

722
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,420
especially Jia Xiaoguo.

723
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,700
You have oily skin.

724
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,000
You must exfoliate your skin.

725
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,740
Then toner, and heat your skin with essence.

726
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,360
If you have beauty devices at home,

727
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,470
make sure you steam your face.

728
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,340
Then the pores will open

729
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,900
and absorb nutrition.

730
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,260
But you have to be careful.

731
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,090
You can't do that too frequently.

732
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,780
At this stage,

733
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,170
you can apply

734
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,380
facial masks.

735
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,300
15 minutes.

736
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,260
Start.

737
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,670
After you apply it,

738
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,000
remember to wash your face with clean water.

739
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,570
Keep it moisturised.

740
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,500
You must lock the nutrition from the mask

741
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,890
within your skin.

742
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,900
Then you need to apply toner,

743
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,860
eye cream, serum,

744
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,430
whitening essence and lotion.

745
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,110
Lastly, you need to apply cream.

746
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,590
If you follow the wrong steps,

747
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,190
your mask will be wasted.

748
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,980
Got it?

749
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,170
Is it done?

750
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,100
Your head.

751
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,210
Raise up your head a bit.

752
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,560
