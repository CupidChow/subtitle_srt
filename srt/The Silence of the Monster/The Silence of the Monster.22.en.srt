If you don't like it,

175
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,510
just give it to me.

176
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,780
What do you like to drink?

177
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,970
I want the Succulent Just Tea just now.

178
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I want the same one as you.

179
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,880
You don't have to buy anything else.

180
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,950
Really?

181
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,610
You really want the same drink as me?

182
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,460
I'll go buy it.

183
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,420
Wait for me here.

184
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,460
I'll be right back.

185
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,850
Hello, welcome.

186
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,530
How can I help you?

187
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,860
I'll wait outside.

188
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,160
OK. Have a rest.

189
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,790
So cute.

190
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,140
Hello, your milk tea.

191
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,530
Okay, thank you.

192
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,150
You're so handsome.

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,320
Thank you.

194
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,340
I have a girlfriend.

195
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,020
Whose cat is it?

196
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,740
Why is it here?

197
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,500
It's dirty.

198
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,100
Leave here.

199
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,450
Give it to me.

200
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,320
Thank you.

201
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,850
Whose cat is it?

202
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,720
So thin.

203
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,430
My Bean Bun is so fat.

204
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,160
Waiting for your master here.

205
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,940
I'm leaving.

206
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:57,890
Bye.

207
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,420
I'm leaving.

208
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,470
I'm back.

209
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,040
An.

210
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,470
Here's our milk tea.

211
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,140
Do we have guests today?

212
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,300
There're a few of them.

213
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,060
They left after taking a look.

214
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,010
It's normal.

215
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,180
That's how it is in a vintage store.

216
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,220
How can you make profit?

217
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:26,850
Profit?

218
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,280
Although I haven't been here for long,

219
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,420
I found that the sales

220
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,180
is not good.

221
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,140
Many people come here

222
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,870
and take photos.

223
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,650
But few people buy things.

224
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,070
You look quite relaxed.

225
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,850
Granny Mi runs this shop

226
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,560
not for money.

227
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,280
She just wants to share.

228
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,540
She simply wanted to share beautiful things

229
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,430
with everyone.

230
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,850
And these things

231
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,240
are meaningful.

232
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,380
That's why

233
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,100
Granny Mi found them

234
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,210
from all over the world.

235
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
They have their own stories behind them.

236
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,910
Come here.

237
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,300
Actually,

238
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,360
many people don't know much about vintage.

239
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,570
They think these are old.

240
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,100
They were used.

241
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,250
So they don't want them

242
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,080
or buy them.

243
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,670
But actually,

244
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,770
people who truly love vintage will know

245
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,700
everything here

246
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,620
has its own story.

247
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,630
They have accompanied an unknown number of individuals

248
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,840
and lived their lives.

249
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,820
I like you who said that.

250
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,360
It cycles again.

251
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,720
What?

252
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,480
My secret.

253
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,320
You like this scarf?

254
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,140
I'm looking at the flowers.

255
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,260
Flowers?

256
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,530
What kind of flower do you like?

257
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,380
I like roses.

258
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,200
Are you busy at your shop?

259
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,730
I saw Robin hurried back.

260
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,730
He was in a hurry to see An.

261
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,460
An?

262
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,839
You mean Fang Qi, right?

263
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,390
She's still in your shop?

264
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,300
She knows who she is.

265
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,410
Didn't she go home?

266
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,700
Yuan, you're here.

267
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,200
Come and have a look.

268
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,140
It has changed a lot in just a few days.

269
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,340
You're here.

270
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,260
Yuan. Come here.

271
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,300
Come here.

272
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,770
Here.

273
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,260
Thanks to everyone's help,

274
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,370
Otherwise, I can't pull myself together.

275
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,940
Xingyu

276
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,010
can't go to school, either.

277
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,660
I'm here to bring you good news.

278
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,560
It's approved.

279
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,250
Thanks to Sui Yi,

280
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,290
Xingyu's mom's community welfare fund

281
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,100
has been approved.

282
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,090
In the future,

283
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,530
she can get some subsidies every month.

284
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,660
At least it can relieve

285
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,740
the pressure in life.

286
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,140
In the future, the community doctors

287
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,070
will come to take care of you regularly.

288
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,460
The doctor said

289
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,300
your body has a certain chance

290
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,010
of recovering after recuperation.

291
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,180
Really?

292
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,260
That's great.

293
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,900
Thank you.

294
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,110
Thank you.

295
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,510
Xiaoguo.

296
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,140
When did An

297
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,240
know her identity?

298
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,920
We told her before New Year's Day.

299
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,410
Granny Mi took her there.

300
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,290
Dali,

301
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,640
you have to study hard this time.

302
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,960
Great!

303
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,080
That's great.

304
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,000
I brought you some daily necessities

305
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,870
and some food.

306
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,890
It's cold in winter.

307
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,970
You'll feel better with this.

308
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,030
You're too polite.

309
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,460
I can take care of myself.

310
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,200
Are you adjusted to the restaurant?

311
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,310
Not bad.

312
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,950
I spend some effort

313
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,930
and do chores. It's not bad.

314
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,620
I don't know whether Song

315
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,530
is relieved about me.

316
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,740
But luckily,

317
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,450
you vouched for me.

318
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,300
Of course.

319
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,180
To be honest,

320
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,230
I was worried at first.

321
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,290
If it weren't for you,

322
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,080
I wouldn't have let him work here.

323
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,830
But now it seems

324
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,170
he did a good job.

325
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,870
The cabinet was broken.

326
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,810
The doorknob was loose.

327
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,100
He fixed them all.

328
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,380
A few days ago, someone caused trouble in the shop.

329
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,100
He helped Zhen out.

330
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,950
Thank you.

331
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,120
It's okay.

332
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,140
Who doesn't have a past?

333
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,440
[Fang Qiqi's fiancée came to the Public Security Bureau to verify the situation.]

334
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,000
[Fiancée?]

335
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:35,580
[We'll go to the vintage store to check the situation with her.]

336
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,640
Call me if anything happens.

337
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,370
Since I vouched for you,

338
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,490
I will take responsibility.

339
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,400
Don't worry.

340
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,050
I'll keep an eye on him.

341
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:48,900
Thank you.

342
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,840
You're welcome.

343
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:52,890
Chufeng.

344
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,470
Song.

00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,150
Who else do you know?

683
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,230
Don't change the subject.

684
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,440
I just like to be reasonable.

685
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,640
Do you really think I can't beat you?

686
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,490
Come on.

687
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,270
Let's have a competition.

688
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,890
I won't go easy on you.

689
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,940
Go.

690
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,070
Let's go.

691
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,930
This time,

692
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,250
I won't go easy on you.

693
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,480
I'm not afraid.

694
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,690
Let's get started.

695
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,820
What? Are you scared?

696
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,210
Come on.

697
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,940
Okay.

698
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:07,920
Three.

699
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,180
Two.

700
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,210
One.

701
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,310
Is this what they call a fight?

702
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,810
How boring.

703
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,900
I don't think they really fought.

704
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,510
I'm not sure.

705
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,570
