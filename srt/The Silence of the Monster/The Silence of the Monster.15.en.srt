00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,539
My dad said

8
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,830
my mom died

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,410
because of me.

10
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,850
Because I always practiced

11
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,670
with the door of our home.

12
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,780
There was a fire.

13
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,139
The lock core was warped by the heat,

14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,150
so the door couldn't be opened.

15
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,140
Then I left home.

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,800
I stopped touching locks

17
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,430
until I met a person.

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,000
That person told me

19
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,260
that undoing locks is not wrong

20
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,300
and that it can also save people.

21
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,180
Whether you harm or save people

22
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,170
depends on your belief.

23
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,160
I started to learn systematically.

24
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,079
I practiced hard

25
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,300
and studied technology.

26
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,210
I wanted to compensate for my mistakes.

27
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,160
So,

28
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,800
no matter who asked me to undo locks,

29
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,100
even if it was just a money box,

30
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,850
I would go.

31
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,430
I thought

32
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,540
I found the meaning of my existence.

33
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,080
I undid the lock

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,780
and saved them.

35
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,080
And then?

36
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,210
What they faced

37
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,079
was cruel reality.

38
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,050
And I still couldn't do anything.

39
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,040
What kind of life do you want?

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,070
What kind of life do I want?

41
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,870
Being alive is a gift.

42
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,290
No matter what happens,

43
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,410
my instinct tells me

44
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,760
to live.

45
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,940
No matter how hard life is,

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,670
I will live sincerely.

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,050
What I want

48
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,240
is a life like this.

49
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,250
A person can't help everyone.

50
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,950
Should we choose not to help them then?

51

♫Getting closer to feel your gentle breathing♫

52
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,550

I came back too late last night.

Here you are. See you.

Take your time. There's no rush.

119
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,540
What's with these calls?

120
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,760
Robin.

121

You...

122
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,980
Can you lend me some more money?

123
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,010
They said

124
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,810
Fu Shuai scammed them.

125
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,290
But you know

126
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,960
Fu Shuai is not that kind of person.

127
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,380
He invested and managed money

128
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,660
with his friends.

129
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,570
There must be some misunderstanding.

130
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,570
Where is Fu Shuai?

131
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,500
I can't find him either.

132
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,790
But he must be more anxious than me.

133
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,340
So you came to me

134
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,090
to help Fu Shuai pay off his debts?

135
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,180
Robin.

136
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,580
I really have no choice.

137
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,660
I only have

138
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,100
a few thousand yuan.

139
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,050
I have no choice but to come to you.

140
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,830
How much does he owe others?

141
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,810
I...

142
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,340
I don't know.

143
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,840
Some are tens of thousands.

144
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,910
Some are several hundred thousand.

145
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Some are a few million.

146
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,750
How dare you want to pay off his debts?

147
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,200
Do you think very highly of me

148
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,470
or are you crazy?

149
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,260
I really don't know how to...

150
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,660
Maybe it's Fu Shuai.

151
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,020
Hello?

152
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,120
Hello?

153
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,890
I can't find Fu Shuai, but I can find you.

154
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,940
I'll kill you at the bar tonight.

155
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,570
Are you crazy?

156
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,780
He'll kill me.

157
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,770
Do you know that?

158
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,620
What did I do wrong?

159
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,010
Why did this happen?

160
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,040
I also want to ask you what you did wrong.

161
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,870
I want to know too.

162
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,870
It was he who borrowed the money.

163
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,970
It was he who scammed others.

164
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,570
You did nothing wrong.

165
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,020
You didn't lie to anyone.

166
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,300
Why should you take the consequences for him

167
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,930
and be responsible for his mistakes?

168
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,350
Fu Shuai didn't lie to me.

169
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,100
How long are you going to keep lying to yourself?

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,350
Do you think he still loves you?

171
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,770
He's just a pickup artist.

172
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,670
Fu Shuai is not a pickup artist.

173
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,310
Fine.

174
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,550
Then you're lying to yourself.

175
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,260
Yes.

176
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,460
I'm lying to myself.

177
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,570
What else can I do?

178
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,570
Leave him.

179
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,040
Cut your losses.

180
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,690
I know now you're frightened

181
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,890
and helpless.

182
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,790
But we have to face the problem,

183
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,600
right?

184
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,380
I'm a lawyer.

185
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,580
I can help you.

186
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,080
[Counselor Sui]

187
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,720
Why hasn't he contacted me yet?

188
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,010
Did he really leave me alone?

189
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,780
It's not your fault.

190
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,460
Don't think it's your fault

191
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,890
when something goes wrong, okay?

192
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,460
I know.

193
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,130
But

194
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,260
I can't help but think this way.

195
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,780
Trust your own judgment.

196
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,810
Don't let others lead you by the nose.

197
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,500
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

198
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,610
No need.

199
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,940
I can go back myself.

200
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,590
Don't worry.

201
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,700
I know what you said.

202
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,060
No.

203
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,320
It's not safe for you to go back alone.

204
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,990
Let me give you a ride.

205
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,660
It's okay.

206
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,370
I'm safe.

207
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,060
Don't worry.

208
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,480
I'll tell you when I get home.

209
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,540
Go back.

210
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,500
Hurry up. You don't have to see me off.

211
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,460
Are you really okay?

212
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:41,980
I'm fine.

213
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,500
I'll text you when I get home safely.

214
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,590
Okay.

215
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,610
Take care.

216
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,140
Okay.

217
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,150
Is she really okay?

218
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,220
That's weird.

219
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,160
It's me.

220
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,060
All right.

221
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,440
Why didn't you text me

222
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,740
or tell me where you were?

223
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,450
Do you know how worried

224
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,880
and frightened I was?

225
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,500
I know.

226
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,310
I thought...

227
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,650
I thought you abandoned me.

228
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,740
Silly girl.

229
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,340
How could I abandon you?

230
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Something happened to me.

231
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,600
I need to hide for a while.

232
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

233
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,620
Stop crying, okay?

234
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,000
What happened to you?

235
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,340
You...

236
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,270
What happened?

237
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,210
Why are you here?

238
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,270
A bastard whose surname is Min

239
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,160
cheated us.

240
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,450
He ran away with money.

241
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,010
We...

242
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,520
We can't get the money back.

243
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,960
What did you say?

244
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,040
What Fu Shuai did

245
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,110
was probably illegal fundraising.

246
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,870
As his girlfriend,

247
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,300
judging from the current situation,

248
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,760
you know that.

249
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,620
He owes so many people money.

250
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,230
Someone will call the police.

251
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,920
Once the police start investigating,

252
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,350
they will ask you about it.

253
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,270
If Fu Shuai contacts you later,

254
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,190
you must tell the police.

255
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,430
This is the only way you can protect yourself.

256
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,760
Lily.

257
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,670
Lily, come here.

258
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,840
Listen to me.

259
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,340
Come.

260
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:37,940
Come.

261
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,070
Sit.

262
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,020
Ay.

263
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:44,520
Come.

264
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,060
This was actually a trap from the beginning.

265
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,980
Min is not the son-in-law

266
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,010
of a rich Cantonese man at all.

267
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,310
He's just a local.

268
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,890
He made some money by selling fake shoes and fake bags.

269
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,180
His luxury cars.

270
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,880
are all rented.

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,130
His Rolex watches are fake too.

272
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,760
Then why did you believe him?

273
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,500
I didn't know they were fake at first.

274
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,760
He was good at acting.

275
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,550
He was also generous.

276
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,420
He even repaid the loans

277
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,020
with high interest rates.

278
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,880
Who would doubt him?

279
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,050
You had dinner with him before, right?

280
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,140
Did you doubt him?

281
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,700
What about the others?

282
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,420
Why did they say

283
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,910
you scammed them?

284
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,319
I didn't scam them.

285
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,740
They called me

286
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,300
to ask for their money.

287
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,890
I dare not turn on my cellphone.

288
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,300
Fu Shuai,

289
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,620
how long are you going to keep lying to me?

290
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,530
No, I'm not lying to you.

291
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,230
I didn't scam them either.

292
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,570
I just recommended a way

293
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,700
of making and investing money to them.

294
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,980
They gave me the money voluntarily.

295
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,320
I didn't keep their money.

296
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,750
I transferred it to Min.

297
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,380
Check my bank account if you don't believe me.

298
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,310
Do you know

299
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,130
the lawyer said what you did was illegal fundraising?

300
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,730
You committed a crime.

301
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,420
Why did you come to a lawyer?

302
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,560
Did you call the police?

303
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,180
I love you so much.

304
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,820
Why don't you believe me?

305
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,180
No.

306
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,340
Well...

307
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,950
That lawyer is just a friend of mine.

308
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,990
Okay. She's your friend.

309
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,780
Lily.

310
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,830
Do you remember when you were sick,

311
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,100
I carried you around

312
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,860
looking for a hospital

313
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,780
in the cold winter?

314
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,650
Also,

315
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,430
when your family didn't care about you,

316
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,530
only I cared about you and spoiled you.

317
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,300
I accompanied you during festivals.

318
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,650
I bought you the bags you wanted.

319
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,870
I bought you the cosmetics you wanted.

320
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,910
Do you think I'm not good enough to you?

321
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,940
You're hurting...

322
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,380
You're hurting me, Fu Shuai.

323
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,770
I'm sorry, Lily.

324
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
I hurt you. I hurt you.

325
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,620
Lily.

326
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,420
Lily.

327
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,140
But you know what?

328
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,040
You go to bars

329
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,700
every night.

330
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,490
Those old men gave you bags.

331
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,160
I tolerated them all.

332
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,100
I always believe you, right?

333
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,280
Do you remember

334
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,030
the child you aborted?

335
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,190
You gave the best thing you had

336
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,510
to another man.

337
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,540
What about me?

338
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,570
What did you give me?

339
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,710
Pain?

340
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,650
Do you know

341
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,150
how I accepted it?

342
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,100
I tried to lie to myself every day.

343
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,660
Do you think anyone else in the world

344
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,370
could ever love you like I do?

345
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,550
No.

346
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,530
No one will love me like you do.

347
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,580
All right, stop crying.

348
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,900
Stop crying.

349
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,910
Stop crying.

350
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,500
If you call the police,

351
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,900
I'll be doomed.

352
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,390
I won't call the police.

353
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,660
Listen to me.

354
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,190
If I were in prison,

355
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,660
you would never find another person

356
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,500
who can treat you so well.

357
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,820
I believe you understand,

358
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,940
right?

359
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,090
I want you to say

360
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,840
"I won't hurt you."

361
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,130
Tell me, okay?

362
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,970
I won't hurt you.

363
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,600
Silly girl.

364
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,390
I told you.

365
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,370
We are one.

366
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,310
We can't live without each other.

367
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,090
Do you know?

368
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,920
I was thinking about something two days ago.

369
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,490
If you left me one day,

370
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,010
guess what would happen to me?

371
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,350
I would die.

372
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,630
You can't do this.

373
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,030
I'd really die.

374
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,830
You can't do this.

375
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,380
I won't leave you.

376
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,530
I won't leave you.

377
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,300
Silly girl.

378
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm telling you these

379
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,540
because I want to let you know

380
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,850
in this world,

381
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,780
I'm the only one

382
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,170
who really loves you.

383
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,860
Only I

384
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,380
want to risk my life to protect you.

385
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:46,760
Understood?

386
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,530
Yes.

387
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,590
Here.

388
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,150
Give me a hug.

389
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,740
But what should we do next?

390
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,120
We have no money.

391
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,220
Find him

392
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,990
and get the money back.

393
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,380
Hello.

394
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,330
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

395
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,900
Please dial again later.

396
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,260
I've searched the bar.

397
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,310
There were many people at the door of the bar.

398
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,110
They were looking for her.

399
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,350
Did she do anything strange

400
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,940
the last time you saw her?

401
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,530
She was on the phone.

402
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,840
She looked very strange.

403
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,340
Fu Shuai was back.

404
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,870
I also think it should be Fu Shuai.

405
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,090
She would only cover for Fu Shuai.

406
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,170
If it were Fu Shuai,

407
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,510
he might lead Lily by the nose again.

408
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,180
She has lost

409
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,980
her judgement.

410
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,520
She'll believe what Fu Shuai says.

411
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,350
Why don't you ask Officer Chen

412
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
to investigate Fu Shuai?

413
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,890
I don't know if he's here.

414
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,650
I can only lead you here.

415
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,980
Thank you, Ling.

416
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:40,960
By the way,

417
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,530
don't tell him

418
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,780
it was I who brought you here.

419
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,700
Don't worry. We won't tell him.

420
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,170
Min.

421
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,130
I was going to see you just now.

422
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,180
Fu Shuai.

423
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,300
Fu Shuai.

424
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,640
Who wanted to scam you?

425
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,420
I was scammed by a person whose surname is Wang.

426
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,930
The investment platform P2P.

427
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,420
We also repaid the loans

428
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,340
with high interest rates before.

429
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,780
Bastard.

430
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,160
I didn't expect him to be worse than me.

431
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,300
You bitch!

432
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,100
Stop crying.

433
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,130
Why are you crying?

434
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,150
Be quiet.

435
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,640
Min. Min.

436
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,820
I told you before, right?

437
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,790
Women are just encumbrances.

438
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,930
They keep us from doing great things.

439
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,400
All they do is cry and buy bags.

440
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,860
It's unnecessary to have them.

441
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,940
I have an idea now.

442
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,500
Look.

443
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,810
No one knows

444
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,570
where we are now.

445
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,050
I can get some money now.

446
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:00,990
We can get out of here.

447
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,870
How much can you get?

448
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,340
50,000 yuan.

449
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,740
70,000 yuan.

450
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,300
80,000 yuan.

451
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,250
80,000 yuan?

452
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,480
80,000 yuan can't last me for a week.

453
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,700
It's useless if you can't get 200,000 yuan.

454
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,780
200,000 yuan?

455
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,140
No.

456
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,860
200,000 yuan is too much.

457
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,380
Can you get some money?

458
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:33,900
I...

459
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,670
I can get it.

460
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,980
I...

461
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,830
I need to make a call.

462
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,500
It's Lily.

463
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,590
Answer the phone.

464
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,300
Put it on speaker.

465
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,890
Lily, where are you?

466
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,210
Yi.

467
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,550
Did you go back to China?

468
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,790
Yes.

469
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,190
I'm at home now.

470
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,870
What happened?

471
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,310
Nothing.

472
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,260
I just want to play with you.

473
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,150
Okay.

474
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,140
Where are you now?

475
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,040
I'll come to meet you.

476
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,810
I'm drinking with my friends here.

477
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,150
We ordered too much wine.

478
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,140
Come here.

479
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,140
Help us.

480
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,020
You just came back.

481
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
I'll give you a welcome.

482
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,030
Okay.

483
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,270
You have to wait for me for a while.

484
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,210
I need to change my clothes.

485
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,910
What's the theme of your party today?

486
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,060
The one you're good at.

487
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,500
Come here alone.

488
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
It's mainly because

489
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,640
there are many good goods here today.

490
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,140
We can't let others have them.

491
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,420
Also,

492
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,170
they only accept cash here.

493
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,600
Bring more here.

494
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,410
Is 100,000 yuan enough?

495
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,960
200,000 yuan.

496
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,550
I drank too much today.

497
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,820
200,000 yuan.

498
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,960
It's nothing.

499
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,440
It's just my one-week pocket money.

500
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,680
Okay.

501
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,970
I'll wait for you.

502
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm hanging up.

503
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,940
Loquacious.

504
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,760
My friend was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.

505
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,210
Her family is wealthy.

506
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,560
She lent me money a few times before,

507
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,700
and she didn't ask me to pay it back.

508
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm sure

509

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,460
We're here.

683
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,320
Is there anyone outside?

684
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,220
We're here.

685
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,220
Help!

686
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,140
If your sister was still alive,

687
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,420
she would never want

688
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,500
her brother to be

689
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,900
weak and incompetent

690
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,220
and trap himself in the past.

691
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,300
A person can't help everyone.

692
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,940
Should we choose not to help them then?

693
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,460
A person's power is insignificant.

694
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,510
But if

695
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,000
the insignificant power

696
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,350
can bring others

697
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,220
even a little hope

698
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,170
or temporary comfort,

699
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,620
this kind of help is meaningful

700
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,820
and should be persisted in.

701
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,110
What kind of life do you want?

702
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,850
What kind of life do I want?

703
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,850
Undoing locks is not wrong.

704
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,500
It can also save people.

705
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,400
Whether you harm or save people

706
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,430
depends on your heart.

707
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,890
I want a life where I don't need to think too much

708
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,170
and can follow my inner voice

709
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,660
to be myself.

710
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,140
I want a life

711
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,370
where I don't care what others think

712
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,780
and can take the high road.

714
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,340
Brother Chufeng.

715
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,700
Can you teach me how to make a paper crane?

716
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,560
I can't make it well.

717
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,380
Silly girl.

718
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,850
How many times have I taught you?

719
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,140
Think about it yourself.

720
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,020
I have homework to do.

721
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,460
Just teach me this step.

722
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,220
No.

723
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,490
Please.

724
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,510
All right.

725
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:38,620
Look carefully.

726
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,430
Fold the tail.

727
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,280
Then lower the head.

728
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,730
Do you remember?

729
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,350
Thank you, brother.

730
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,320
No matter how we met,

731
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,550
and how you suddenly barged into my life,

732
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,180
can I have such a life?

733
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,980
If happiness cannot be easily promised,

734
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,800
is it necessary for us to try?

735
