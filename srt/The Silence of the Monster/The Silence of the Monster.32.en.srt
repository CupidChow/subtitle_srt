00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,850
We're home.

6
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,780
I'm back!

7
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,020
What do you want for lunch?

8
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,530
Can I have whatever I want?

9
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,430
Of course.

10
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,700
It's your first day back today.

11
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,640
What if I want to eat everything?

12
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,330
How many dishes do you want?

13
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,300
I…

14
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,520
Ten dishes please.

15
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm a pig breeder indeed.

16
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,570
Well, I'm a cute pig.

17
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,390
Wang Qing.

18
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:36,900
Wang Qing.

19
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,880
Miss Sui.

20
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,220
Do you need it?

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,110
I'll be ready soon.

22
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:41,980
No.

23
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,340
I was wondering

24
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,340
if you could give me the files

25
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,300
I asked you to sort out this morning.

26
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,970
Sorry, I forgot it.

27
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,920
I'll get it for you now.

28
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,610
Wait a minute.

29
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,390
Miss Sui.

30
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,580
What's wrong?

31
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,100
I heard

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,410
your boyfriend is a great locksmith.

33
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,620
Yes.

34
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,660
Is there anything wrong?

35
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,450
Do you need help?

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,180
No, no.

37
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,660
I was just asking.

38
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,570
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,340
Well,

40
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,570
I'm gonna get the files for you now.

41
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,150
Miss Sui.

42
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,860
What's wrong, Wang?

43
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,030
I...

44
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,540
Wang.

45
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,660
What's wrong with you lately?

46
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,850
You seem distracted.

47
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,360
Are you in trouble?

48
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,040
Let me know if you have any problems.

49
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,180
I will try my best

50
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,150
to help you.

51
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,780
Miss Sui.

52
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,500
Could you do me a favor?

53
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,600
What is it?

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,280
I asked you before

55
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,000
whether your boyfriend was a locksmith.

56
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,120
This is Professor Xu Chenghuan.

57
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,100
He's a prestigious appraiser

58
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,810
in our country.

59
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,250
He was Qing's father's best friend when he was alive.

60
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,220
Mr. Xu.

61
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,100
Thank you.

62
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,250
You're welcome.

63
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,140
This is the locksmith I mentioned,

64
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,090
Mr. He Chufeng.

65
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,270
Why are you here?

66
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,740
I came here with my teacher.

67
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,470
How have you been?

68
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:28,890
Not too bad.

69
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,040
This is a double-sided locked box.

70
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,300
There's a lock on each of both sides.

71
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,620
They need to be opened at the same time.

72
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,060
I can only control one side,

73
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,020
so I need someone

74
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,590
to help me control the other side.

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,020
What kind of person do you need?

76
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,420
To open this lock,

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,500
those two people need to have telepathic communications.

78
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,810
They need to breathe equally.

79
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,520
They even need to collaborate with each other to use strengths.

80
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,500
The original design purpose of this lock

81
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,720
is like twins.

82
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,690
One person

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,370
is like another self of the other person.

84
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,420
So it's better for them

85
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,220
to have similar length of fingers.

86
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,960
But

87
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,700
we only have three opportunities to open it.

88
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,700
If we fail three times,

89
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,920
it's likely that it won't be opened anymore.

90
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,030
I don't know if it's appropriate to say this now.

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,440
Isn't Miss Sui your girlfriend?

92
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,730
Her breathing frequency

93
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,090
must be the same as yours.

94
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,460
But I don't know how to open the lock.

95
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,130
Do you know how?

96
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,970
I've seen it at a friend's place.

97
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,970
I played it once.

98
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,320
But it can only be opened by two people

99
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,100
who have telepathic communications.

100
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,120
They need to trust each other

101
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,770
and rely on each other.

102
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,660
Mr. He has advanced technique

103
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,920
of opening locks.

104
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,180
I don't know if I can do it.

105
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,620
Didn't you open the lock once?

106
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,650
You must remember the steps.

107
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,180
Didn't you open the lock once?

108
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,250
You must remember the steps.

109
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,830
I'll open the first two.

110
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,890
You open the last two.

111
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,570
Got it.

112
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,620
Tell me when you're done.

113
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:06,930
We'll open it then.

114
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,270
Ready?

115
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,100
Three, two,

116
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,230
one.

117
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,130
Is it because of my unbalanced strength?

118
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,310
You were distracted.

119
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,260
You weren't concentrating.

120
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,470
We need to trust each other

121
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,370
and have telepathic communications

122
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,060
to unlock this box.

123
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,940
Does Mr. He trust me enough?

124
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,030
Ready?

125
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,860
Three.

126
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:23,820
Two.

127
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,060
One.

128
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,180
It's open.

129
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,110
Great!

130
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,180
Go. Let's have a look.

131
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,580
Thank you.

132
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,240
Thank you for your trust.

133
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,900
Thank you.

134
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,240
Thank you.

135
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,750
Mr. Xu.

136
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,010
Please take a look.

137
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,660
With all due respect,

138
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,590
this is not Mr. Wang Jian's work.

139
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,680
Look.

140
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,340
The leaf on this cup

141
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,280
is not complete.

142
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,430
The veins are blurry.

143
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,400
The root is unclear.

144
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,810
But Mr. Wang Jian's work

145
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,690
is known for its perfection.

146
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,500
With his temper,

147
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,610
he would have destroyed

148
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,300
a flawed leaf teacup immediately

149
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,340
and wouldn't have kept it so well.

150
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,320
Professor.

151
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,150
Indeed.

152
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,360
This cup has no signature. It isn't marked either.

153
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,790
Is it appropriate

154
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,500
to make a judgment

155
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,840
only because of Mr. Wang Jian's habit

156
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,110
of destroying inferior products?

157
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,810
We need to analyse it case by case.

158
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,340
I know Wang Jian well.

159
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,790
His habit wouldn't change.

160
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,730
Is it possible that Mr. Wang Jian lied?

161
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,350
Could it be that he locked an inferior cup

162
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,930
not made by himself

163
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
in the box

164
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,340
and lied to his family

165
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,000
that this is his best work?

166
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,410
Can Mr. Luo only think of deception?

167
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,780
This Jian Zhan is not

168
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,330
Mr. Wang Jian's work.

169
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,180
There could be many reasons,

170
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,510
but you only thought of deception.

171
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,900
Not everyone is good at lying,

172
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,280
especially when it comes to people they really care about.

173
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,340
Even if what Professor Xu said is true

174
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,500
that this wasn't made by Mr. Wang Jian,

175
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,360
I believe he must have his reasons

176
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,480
for keeping it for you.

177
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,820
This is his privacy.

178
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,860
Let's not make any guesses.

179
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,740
Sorry.

180
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,750
I was just saying my opinion.

181
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,900
Excuse me.

182
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,940
But this one is terrible.

183
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,500
Even if it was really made by a master,

184
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,180
I think it's too bad

185
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,020
for a competition.

186
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,190
[Monster Vintage]

187
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,940
Did you arrange it?

188
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,940
Arrange?

189
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,300
Arrange what?

190
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,920
Had you known that he was going

191
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,770
so you asked me to go there on purpose?

192
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,270
Robin?

193
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,580
I didn't know Robin would come.

194
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,970
Wang Qing asked me

195
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,020
to find a locksmith,

196
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,940
so I informed you.

197
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,700
I was surprised

198
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,960
when I saw him there today.

199
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,260
What a coincidence.

200
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,890
Chufeng.

201
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,860
I really hope you two can make up,

202
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,290
but I didn't arrange it.

203
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,250
I just think you two

204
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
really match.

205
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,710
Didn't you say

206
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,520
you can face it

207
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
with peace?

208
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,730
But I'm afraid

209
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,690
you still don't get over it.

210
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,660
Otherwise,

211
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,400
you wouldn't have argued with him

212
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,380
in front of so many people.

213
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,070
I just...

214
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,370
You just care about him.

215
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,220
That's why you were so mad.

216
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,380
If you care so much about him,

217
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,470
why don't you talk to him?

218
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,970
Nothing to talk about.

219
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,200
It's not easy

220
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,040
to have a bosom friend.

221
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,940
It's such a pity

222
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,700
for you two to break up.

223
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,100
Chufeng.

224
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,940
Are you going to keep doing this?

225
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,440
I think you care about him.

226
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,530
I'm going back to my room.

227
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,340
Think about it.

228
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,880
Robin.

229
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,460
If you have time,

230
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,280
let's talk.

231
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,420
Did you design that coincidence on purpose?

232
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,950
I didn't.

233
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,650
Have some water.

234
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,900
I've looked at Wang Jian's cup carefully.

235
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,560
I've also studied his other works.

236
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,430
Judging from the craftsmanship

237
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,400
and material of that cup,

238
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,380
it has the same characteristics with Wang Jian's work.

239
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,500
Although he did have the habit

240
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,060
of destroying inferior teacups,

241
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,370
I don't think

242
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,370
this habit could be a decisive factor

243
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,540
to decide whether it was made by Wang Jian.

244
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,580
It does require comprehensive consideration

245
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,190
to decide who is the maker.

246
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,060
Have you discussed this

247
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,310
with Professor Xu later?

248
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,060
I mentioned it to him when I went back,

249
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,830
but he still insisted on what he believed.

250
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,720
When we had disagreements,

251
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,320
either I convinced him

252
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,660
or he convinced me.

253
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,460
We usually reached an agreement,

254
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,710
but this time, he didn't convince me.

255
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,300
He just insisted that he knew Wang Jian well.

256
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,619
That is weird.

257
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,089
You said Professor Xu and Wang Jian were old friends?

258
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:11,869
Yes.

259
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,230
Is it possible that

260
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,500
Professor Xu knows

261
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,609
this is Wang Jian's work,

262
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,490
but he just didn't tell the truth

263
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,329
for some reasons?

264
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,220
As you said,

265
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,920
there are flaws with the leaf teacup.

266
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,740
Maybe Professor Xu

267
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,180
was trying to save Wang Jian's face.

268
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,380
Absolutely not.

269
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,860
I've known Professor Xu for a long time.

270
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,690
He never lies.

271
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,150
He offended someone

272
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,180
only because he said the truth.

273
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,790
But I also think

274
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,380
an appraisal like this is a bit strange.

275
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,500
Only they know

276
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,300
what happened between them.

277
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,010
Didn't you say He Chufeng was there too?

278
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,040
Did you talk to him?

279
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,340
Stop it. It gives me a headache.

280
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,820
You can't keep avoiding him.

281
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,050
It was really awkward

282
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,510
when we met today.

283
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,340
The way he looked at me today

284
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,860
was like he was going to eat me.

285
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,470
He was as cool as an iceberg.

286
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,400
Ice will melt eventually.

287
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,490
I'll go with the flow.

288
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,780
Aren't you going to talk to him?

289
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,390
There might be some misunderstanding.

290
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,910
There's nothing to talk about.

291
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,040
That's the end.

292
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,140
Even if this is the end,

293
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,680
at least

294
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,220
you should give yourself

295
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,030
a chance to know the truth.

296
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,410
I don't want you

297
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,640
to lose an important friend

298
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,190
because of any misunderstanding.

there could be many reasons,

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,530
but you only thought of deception.

Wang Qing is on leave today.

327
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,890
On leave?

328
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,320
Is she sick?

329
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,750
She asked for the personal leave.

330
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,270
But it's strange.

331
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,580
She never took a leave.

332
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,540
After she left,

333
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,740
I think it's too inconvenient.

334
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,110
Our printer was running out of ink.

335
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,380
We had been looking for the ink box for a long time,

336
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,420
but no one found it.

337
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,420
I didn't realise

338
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,840
Wang Qing has done so many good things.

339
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,840
Wang Qing has done a lot of good stuff, okay?

340
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,530
Mr. Yu,

341
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,930
you asked her

342
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,220
to buy cold medicine for you

343
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,290
when your girlfriend was sick,

344
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,770
and you just realized that?

345
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,210
Right.

346
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:20,940
Yes.

347
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,580
How can I help you?

348
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm free. I'll do it for you.

349
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,630
Save it.

350
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,210
I dare not bother you.

351
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,160
It’s Mr. Jin.

352
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,150
I asked her

353
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,540
to sort out some files for me.

354
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,700
I need it now,

355
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,320
so I want to ask her.

356
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,460
Mr. Jin?

357
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,400
Is his purchase procedure complicated?

358
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,650
Not really.

359
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,980
There's just something I don't fully understand.

360
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I want to check it again.

361
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,190
Fine.

362
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,650
I can't help you with this.

363
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,500
Do it yourself.

364
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,060
I'm gonna go.

365
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,500
Okay.

366
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,620
Miss Sui,

367
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,030
these are the files you asked for.

368
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,710
I'll be at home

369
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,730
these days.

370
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,920
I can't come to the law firm.

371
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,300
But if you need

372
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,720
me to search anything,

373
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,660
just let me know.

374
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,220
I'll try my best to do it at home.

375
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,650
Besides,

376
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,000
opening the interlinked lock

377
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,600
and opening the wooden box my dad left

378
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,660
is very important

379
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,100
to our family.

380
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,380
My family and I

381
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,100
are very grateful to you and Mr. He.

382
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,870
You're welcome.

383
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,100
Thank you for the files.

384
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,860
Take care of your family.

385
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,620
Could there be many of it

386
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,350
and you've mistaken one for another?

387
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,170
Qing's father gave it to me in person

388
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,350
before he passed away.

389
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,200
It can't be wrong.

390
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,780
What did he tell you?

391
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,130
He said that the last cup he made

392
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,730
was in this wooden box.

393
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,420
It's the best one he had ever made.

394
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,660
It's his proudest work.

395
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,040
He wanted me to open it as needed.

396
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,050
But it mustn't be made by uncle.

397
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,370
He wouldn't leave

398
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,380
a cup with flaws.

399
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,020
I think this is a cup made by my dad.

400
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,610
My dad wouldn't

401
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,700
take someone else's work

402
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,650
as his.

403
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,420
He always made good works.

404
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,900
My father knew how to make Jian Zhan well.

405
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,340
He must have a special purpose

406
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,100
of leaving this Jian Zhan.

407
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,190
But even Professor Xu said

408
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,710
it isn't uncle's work.

409
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,860
Not only perfect works

410
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,420
are good works.

411
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,450
Isn't perfect the best?

412
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,420
Look at you.

413
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,930
Although the Jian Zhan you made

414
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,450
is not a standard one,

415
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,410
you didn't shape it

416
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,780
purposefully,

417
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,650
which makes it look natural and lively.

418
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,860
Compared to those standard Jian Zhan,

419
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,420
it's livelier.

420
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,030
But it's just a flawed cup.

421
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,340
Not everyone can make

422
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,330
a perfect Jian Zhan.

423
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,820
Likewise,

424
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,480
it's not the only goal

425
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,960
for a maker to make perfect Jian Zhan.

426
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,430
Don't let perfection

427
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,520
become a frame that limits us.

428
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,010
Just like this one,

429
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,810
something with defects may be the one that has a soul.

430
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,930
Something with defects

431
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,190
may be the one that has a soul.

432
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,540
Miss Sui, Mr. He,

433
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,770
sorry to bother you early in the morning.

434
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,190
It's okay.

435
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,140
You must have something important.

436
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,220
Miss Sui.

437
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,620
Could you

438
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,300
help me contact Robin?

439
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,300
I'm sorry.

440
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,420
I noticed that

441
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,440
you all know Robin that day.

442
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,360
Yes.

443
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,830
We all know him.

444
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,610
He used to work here.

445
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,680
He's an excellent appraiser.

446
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,690
I'd like to ask Robin

447
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,300
to help appraise this leaf teacup again.

448
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,870
I think this leaf teacup

449
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,140
is my father's work.

450
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,620
Are you doubting

451
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,990
Professor Xu's appraisal?

452
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,320
I know I'm not qualified

453
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,900
to question Professor Xu's appraisal

454
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,170
or his academic level.

455
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,500
But as Wang Jian's daughter,

456
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,100
I think this is my father's work.

457
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,860
On the day Professor Xu did the appraisal,

458
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,460
Robin had a different opinion,

459
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,080
so I'd like to know his opinion.

460
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,340
Miss Sui.

461
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,050
If it's convenient for you,

462
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,090
could you please

463
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,620
help me contact Robin

464
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,820
and ask him to do another appraisal for me?

465
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,740
Professor Xu is his teacher.

466
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,420
It may be a bit awkward

467
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,550
to ask him to do another appraisal

468
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,600
after his teacher's appraisal.

469
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,940
I'm sorry for making things difficult for you.

470
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,100
Or,

471
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,740
could you give me

472
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,400
his contact information?

473
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,830
I can contact

474
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,380
and ask him myself.

475
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,880
Call him now.

476
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,120
Bean Bun.

477
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,420
I'm glad you have a conscience.

478
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,530
Give me a hug.

479
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,180
You're back.

480
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,230
Yes.

481
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,180
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

482
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,540
Well,

483
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,970
I forgot.

484
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,800
Come in, please.

485
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,220
Could you hold the box for me?

486
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,830
I want to hold Bean Bun for a while.

487
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,790
When I was at your house that day,

488
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,700
I knew it is Mr. Wang Jian's work.

489
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,960
I searched a lot of information when I went back.

490
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,390
I still think so

491
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,650
looking at this Jian Zhan today.

492
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,840
But Professor Xu said it isn't.

493
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,510
Besides,

494
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,590
this is indeed different from

495
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,050
my father's previous works.

496
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,330
I'm not 100% sure.

497
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,660
10% of the…

498
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,860
10% of the reasons

499
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,950
are because Professor Xu's conclusion

500
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,780
may be drawn based on other factors.

501
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,810
You mean

502
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,620
Professor Xu might be hiding something?

503
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,060
I don't know.

504
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,920
Actually, I have a lot of questions.

505
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,590
Professor Xu has always been objective

506
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,100
when he does appraisals.

507
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,570
He doesn't lie.

508
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,260
Someone also said he never lied,

509
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,700
but in the end, he lied.

510
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,740
Hello, Professor Xu.

511
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,520
Yes.

512
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,060
Miss Sui.

513
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,150
Your place is so nice.

514
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,960
You must be happy

515
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,950
living with so many friends.

516
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,650
Yes.

517
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,740
You're just like my family.

518
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,220
You're all good

519
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,620
and talented.

520
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,490
You're good too.

521
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,220
Without you at the law firm,

522
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,110
we feel like we are not complete.

523
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,470
I'm not that good,

524
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,310
but my dad and the others are great.

525
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,250
Our whole family can make Jian Zhan.

526
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,440
Only I,

527
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,360
as his daughter,

528
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,450
didn't inherit anything.

529
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,780
My dad must be very sad.

530
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,750
He was always busy.

531
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,200
He always had a lot to do.

532
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,280
I have a yard like this at home.

533
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,970
There is a tree in the yard.

534
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,980
My dad and I had a deal when I was young.

535
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,690
Every autumn,

536
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,570
we would go to the yard

537
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,640
to pick up the first falling leaf.

538
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,650
What do you mean by the first falling leaf?

539
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,500
Is there any special meaning?

540
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,150
Yes.

541
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,820
Qing.

542
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,480
Let me tell you a secret.

543
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,440
Actually,

544
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,940
the leaf teacup made of the first falling leaf

545
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,110
is the most beautiful one.

546
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,380
The reason why a leaf teacup is beautiful

547
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,130
because Jian Zhan

548
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,440
extends the beauty of nature via leaves.

549
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,960
Therefore, every leaf teacup

550
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,429
is unique.

551
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,449
No two leaves in the world are the same.

552
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,750
Qing.

553
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,110
In my opinion,

554
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,300
only a leaf teacup

555
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,740
made of flawed leaves

556
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,150
has the meaning of time.

557
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,750
The more meaning of time it has,

558
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,940
the more beauty of nature it integrates.

559
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,780
So beautiful.

560
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,130
I'll wait for the first falling leaf

561
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,010
every year going forward

562
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,230
and see what it looks like.

563
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,830
Okay.

564
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,180
Let's make a deal.

565
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,720
We'll come here to pick up the first falling leaf every autumn.

566
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:27,920
Okay.

567
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:28,820
Deal.

568
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,360
Why didn't I think of

569
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,820
paying attention to the first falling leaf?

570
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:40,680
Well,

571
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,700
I need to write it down on my phone.

572
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,310
My dad is a very romantic person.

573
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,970
In fact, many people said

574
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,720
he was too strict about perfection,

575
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,580
but only I know

576
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,120
my dad wasn't like that.

577
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,530
He always told me

578
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,940
sometimes,

579
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,430
perfection is not the most important thing.

580
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,530
Something with defects

581
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,210
may be the one that has a soul.
