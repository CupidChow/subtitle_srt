ATM?

6
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:22,980
More than that.

7
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,780
It's more complicated.

8
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,680
I added something else.

9
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,040
Does it look familiar?

10
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,110
I think I've seen it once.

11
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,050
This is the lock I used to take part in the secret game.

12
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,300
But I didn't take part in it.

13
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,010
He Chufeng.

14
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,730
I won't go easy on you.

15
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,880
I know.

16
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,480
Are you ready?

17
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,730
Three, two, one.

18
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,140
I'm 28 today.

19
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,540
Before that, I had a miserable life

20
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,700
and a terrible past.

21
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,260
But I still want

22
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,130
a life worth looking forward to.

23
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,270
I never think winning

24
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,220
is disgraceful.

25
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,370
I really want to beat him.

26
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,060
I can't hide

27
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,280
my desire for victory

28
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,430
and my desire for happiness anymore.

29
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,260
I have the job I love.

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,830
I want to take

31
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,730
my passionate career seriously.

32
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,600
I feel the happiness

33
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,780
joy, achievements

34
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,860
and glory from it.

35
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,460
I have friends who accompany me.

36
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,019
Although we have different personalities,

37
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,310
and we have different ideas about things.

38
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,100
I know

39
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,060
they are my

40
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,750
sincere friends.

41
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,909
I like this kind of life.

42
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,980
I should

43
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,290
deserve a life like this.

44
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:52,970
It's open.

45
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,650
Yes!

46
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,040
Yes! Yes! Yes!

47
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,620
Are you going easy on me?

48
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,360
Are you pitying me?

49
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,410
What do you mean by the expression in your eyes?

50
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,790
Are you mocking me?

51
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,390
Do you think I'm a joke?

52
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,260
You're the best, right?

53
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,840
Yes.

54
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,970
You're the best.

55
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,230
You're the greatest. You're excellent.

56
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,740
What do you think?

57
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,610
Are you showing off to me?

58
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,270
Don't forget

59
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,270
I taught you all your skills.

60
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,650
If I hadn't found you

61
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,390
at the garage,

62
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,280
you would still fix broken cars!

63
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,470
Do you want to beat me?

64
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,950
Impossible.

65
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,620
But...

66
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,710
But you...

67
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,370
You let me win.

68
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,750
Are you okay?

69
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,720
Do you think you're living a good life?

70
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,160
Do you think you have everything?

71
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,860
You're in a relationship.

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,830
You work in the police station,

73
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,200
and teach the security and theft prevention class in the community.

74
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,780
Do you really think you are

75
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,460
the incarnation of justice and kindness?

76
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,780
You're too naive.

77
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,500
Do you think everyone

78
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,830
are sincere to you?

79
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,800
Including that stupid appraiser,

80
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,570
doesn't he have a purpose?

81
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,540
Do you remember Zhao Chengqiu?

82
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,920
He's Robin's father.

83
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,300
His surname is Luo.

84
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,250
That's because his mother's surname is Luo.

85
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,290
They got divorced.

86
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,430
He took after his mother's surname.

87
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,669
Zhao Chengqiu.

88
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,299
is his biological father.

89
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,570
Lu Chengli is just his stepfather.

90
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,610
Even he is his father,

91
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,660
it has nothing to do with him.

92
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,540
You thought you were best friends.

93
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,670
But why don't you know these things?

94
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,620
You treat them with sincerity.

95
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,710
But are they sincere to you?

96
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,620
He knows everything.

97
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,750
But you know nothing.

98
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,440
Your sister could have lived.

99
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,720
She won't die.

100
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,150
This is what

101
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,970
you know better than I do.

102
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,700
Your sister committed suicide

103
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,490
because of Zhao Chengqiu and your father.

104
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,500
But you became the best friend

105
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,210
of Zhao Chengqiu's son.

106
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,330
Your sister committed suicide

107
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,070
because of Zhao Chengqiu and your father.

108
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,080
But you became the best friend

109
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,680
of Zhao Chengqiu's son.

110
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,860
Brother.

111
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,310
You trust others too easily.

112
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,940
He Chufeng.

113
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,110
Look carefully.

114
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,820
In this world,

115
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,010
only you and I are the same.

116
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,340
Only me!

117
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,550
We are the same!

118
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,800
♫Happy birthday to you♫

119
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,530
♫Happy birthday to you♫

120
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,820

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,820

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,090

♫Happy birthday to you♫

126
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,000
Happy birthday.

127
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,220
Happy birthday.

128
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,260
Chufeng.

129
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,410
What's wrong?

130
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,090
Are you tired?

131
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,390
If you're tired,

132
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,310
you can take a rest first.

133
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,940
You can eat the cake later.

134
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,730
Yeah, no hurry.

135
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,740
We're adults.

136
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,270
We don't care about formalities.

137
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,100
No.

138
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,380
You must make a wish

139
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,880
and eat the cake now.

140
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,780
We have prepared

141
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,130
gifts so carefully.

142
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,620
Here.

143
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,140
Make a wish.

144
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:35,980
Blow it.

145
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
When did you know

146
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,330
Chunian died?

147
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,890
Who is Zhao Chengqiu?

148
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,220
He's my biological father.

149
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,710
So,

150
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,020
you knew

151
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,340
when Chunian died

152
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,500
and why she died a long time ago.

153
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,500
But you never told me.

154
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,400
You have been pretended you know nothing.

155
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,460
Robin.

156
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,610
Do you think

157
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,090
I'm like a clown being watched by you?

158
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,430
You knew everything,

159
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,750
but you didn't tell me.

160
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,140
You keep saying that

161
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,100
I'm your best friend.

162
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,890
Best friend?

163
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,680
Nonsense.

164
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,010
I wanted to tell you long ago.

165
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,450
But I didn't know how to say it.

166
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,780
She's my sister.

167
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,070
Do you know what your dad did to Chunian?

168
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,570
If your dad

169
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,280
didn't make the fake certificate,

170
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,440
she wouldn't have forced herself to go to school.

171
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,280
She didn't have to force herself to admit that she was healthy.

172
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
She was sick.

173
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,450
She had been suffering.

174
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,820
She needed your dad, as a doctor,

175
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,830
to tell her

176
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,760
that you don't have to pretend or force yourself.

177
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,340
Why?

178
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,810
Why?

179
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,360
She clearly has hope.

180
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,000
She could get better.

181
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,370
She could care about nothing.

182
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:32,950
Clearly...

183
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,170
It's been ten years.

184
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,740
Do you know how I've survived

185
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,100
for the past ten years?

186
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,330
I tried so hard to forget about my mom

187
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,240
and my sister.

188
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,710
I had to tell myself that

189
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,760
making my teacher who teaches me skills

190
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,069
and lets me start a new life be jailed

191
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,180
is the right thing over and over again.

192
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,030
I worked so hard to live.

193
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,720
Am I wrong?

194
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,859
I don't expect anything.

195
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,750
I just want a simple and ordinary life.

196
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,470
How could you interfere in my life

197
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,319
and watch my tragic experience?

198
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,480
By the way,

199
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,200
you are an appraiser.

200
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,620
You're an excellent appraiser.

201
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,250
Do you think

202
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,200
that appraising my life is interesting

203
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,060
and fun?

204
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,620
You see me slowly opening my heart to you

205
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,550
and letting you into my life.

206
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,100
And then you use

207
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,880
the knife you prepared early

208
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,840
to insert in my heart deeply.

209
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,850
What should come will come eventually.

210
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,110
Lies can never be true.

211
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,340
Not everyone can understand lies.

212
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,020
Are you okay?

213
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,060
I want to be alone.

214
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,490
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

215
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,070
Please try again later.

216
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,470
Is there any misunderstanding between you two?

217
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,270
Do you want to sit down and talk?

218
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,790
There's nothing to talk about.

219
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,210
Maybe he was wrong.

220
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
But maybe

221
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,550
we don't know the whole story.

222
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,650
Should we contact him again?

223
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,460
Forget it.

224
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,690
Let them calm down.

225
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,540
It must be Robin.

226
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:28,750
Hello.

227
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,590
I'm Robin's friend. He asked me to help you.

228
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:31,810
I'm Roger.

229
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,220
He asked someone to help in the morning

230
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,720
What is he doing?

231
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,980
He doesn't even care about the store.

232
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,750
By the way, Sui Yi,

233
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,290
I'll go back soon.

234
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,220
Robin is not here.

235
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,390
It's meaningless for me to stay here.

236
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
You can stay here forever.

237
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,170
Okay, I understand.

238
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,490
Call me if you need anything.

239

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,330
Well,

340
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:46,940
what about you?

341
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,220
I'm fine.

342
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,180
I can stay here alone.

343
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,060
I'm used to it.

344
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,520
Sorry.

345
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,740
I need to go home.

346
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,020
I want to visit my grandpa.

347
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm fine.

348
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,830
Don't worry about me.

349
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,700
I'm fine here alone.

350
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,500
Really?

351
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,040
I cooked a lot today.

352
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,610
[Ten years ago]

353
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:48,970
Dad.

354
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,780
Dad.

355
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,150
Stop drinking.

356
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,580
Drinking too much is bad for your health.

357
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,540
Let go of me.

358
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,050
I don't need your care.

359
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,140
None of your business.

360
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:56,980
Get lost!

361
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,770
Dad.

362
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,810
I'll leave when you fall asleep.

363
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,470
And I will leave very fast.

364
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,910
Let go of me!

365
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,100
What do you know?

366
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,380
I killed someone.

367
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,020
Dad.

368
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,080
What are you talking about?

369
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,090
Let go of me!

370
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,060
Stay away from me

371
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,850
as far as possible.

372
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,550
Your mother is right.

373
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,830
She wanted to cut ties with me.

374
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,750
Yes.

375
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,580
I'm a murderer.

376
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:22,970
Dad.

377
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,060
Tell me.

378
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,900
Why do you say you're a murderer

379
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,160
when you're drunk?

380
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,780
If you commit a crime,

381
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,260
you'll be arrested by the police.

382
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,020
Police?

383
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:37,900
Yes.

384
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,460
Why didn't the police catch me?

385
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,940
Why didn't they come to catch me?

386
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,460
Dad, who did you kill?

387
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:53,090
It's me who killed He Chufeng's sister,

388
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,830
He Chunian.

389
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,520
She is your classmate...

390
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,690
She is your classmate's sister, He Chunian.

391
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,280
Hello, doctor.

392
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,100
Hello, kid.

393
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,100
Sit tight.

394
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,380
Doctor,

395
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,830
we're here to consult you.

396
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,400
OK.

397
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,450
Mr. He,

398
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,940
please take a closer look.

399
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,310
This is the diagnosis certificate.

400
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,800
[Diagnosis Certificate]

401
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,980
Take a closer look.

402
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,480
I don't believe it.

403
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,200
That's impossible.

404
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,580
She must be dramatic.

405
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,700
What disease would she have?

406
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,820
This...

407
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,620
She made it herself.

408
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,330
Can't she act like a normal person?

409
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,540
I don't know what depression is.

410
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,850
Everyone has pressure.

411
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,110
I'm stressed out every day.

412
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,080
Her mother died

413
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,050
and her brother didn't learn to be good.

414
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,460
I'm also under a lot of pressure.

415
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,120
She's making a fuss about an imaginary illness.

416
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,300
She just thinks too much.

417
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,140
As long as she goes to school,

418
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,380
she will be fine.

419
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,710
Mr. He,

420
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,770
calm down.

421
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,900
I also hope

422
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,630
you can seriously consider it.

423
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,050
Your daughter's disease is in the early stage.

424
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,400
She'll be fine soon with treatment.

425
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,410
Let's go.

426
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,660
Let's go home.

427
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,520
Go. Let's go home.

428
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:42,860
No.

429
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,250
Go home.

430
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,680
No.

431
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,090
Stop it.

432
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,680
-I don't want to go home. -Be good.

433
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,150
-I don't want to go home. -Stop.

434
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,260
Go home.

435
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,180
No, I don't want to.

436
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,930
I said stop it!

437
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,780
Doctor Zhao.

438
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,860
I beg you.

439
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,540
What are you doing?

440
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,140
What are you doing?

441
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,860
Get up.

442
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,380
Get up.

443
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,790
Calm down.

444
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,780
I beg you.

445
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,660
Let her go to school.

446
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,190
It's right to go to school.

447
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,620
But you have to treat her illness now.

448
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,350
Otherwise, it will get worse.

449
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,550
Later, his father came to me.

450
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,660
He told me Chunian was unhappy when she was at home.

451
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,090
But she was quite happy at school.

452
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,040
I thought it's good for treating depression.

453
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,260
So I agreed.

454
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,410
So I made a fake certificate

455
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,070
to let Chunian go to school.

456
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,120
But then...

457
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,720
Mr. He.

458
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,670
-I've never seen Chunian again. -Mr. He.

459
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm Dr. Zhao.

460
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,240
-I've been to her house -Are you home?

461
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,380
to look for her father.

462
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,210
Mr. He.

463
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,450
Mr. He.

464
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,450
I called you several times

465
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,750
but you didn't answer.

466
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,270
The child must be cured.

467
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,400
As a parent,

468
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,680
why aren't you worried at all?

469
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,580
Why aren't you nervous?

470
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,480
Look how drunk you are.

471
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,770
If this continues,

472
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:38,650
the child

473
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,030
will be destroyed by you sooner or later.

474
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,210
This is a mental illness.

475
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,980
It have to be treated well.

476
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,580
Mr. He,

477
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,260
are you done?

478
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,060
Yes.

479
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,940
I will take care of

480
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,710
my own child.

481
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,000
What can doctors do?

482
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,380
You just call the kid to the hospital

483
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,580
and prescribe lots of medicine

484
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,970
that I don't know.

485
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,380
Chatting? Talking?

486
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,750
Can't I talk to her?

487
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,700
Why?

488
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,980
Why can't my child go to school?

489
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,950
I'll give you a certificate.

490
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,440
But you have to promise

491
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,990
you must let her receive treatment.

492
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,220
Last month,

493
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,990
she committed suicide.

494
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,210
I, as her father...

495
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,740
I couldn't save her.

496
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,490
I failed to save her.

497
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,080
Son.

498
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,660
Brother.

499
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,010
Why are you sitting here alone?

500
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,270
I'm thinking about something.

501
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,820
Do you like to drink beer

502
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,940
alone by the river?

503
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,330
You're underage. Don't drink.

504
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,350
I'm not real anyway.

505
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,580
If I were still alive,

506
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,280
I would be 20 years old.

507
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,360
19 and a half years old.

508
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,810
You remember it better than me.

509
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,610
Brother.

510
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,530
You must have had a hard time.

511
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,830
I know it was also hard for you.

512
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,310
But I didn't

513
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,990
stand by your side

514
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,610
when you were in pain.

515
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,300
Why didn't you tell me?

516
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,090
Since when...

517
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,430
Third year?

518
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Fourth grade?

519
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,050
We read texts when we were in school.

520
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,940
Every text has a protagonist.

521
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,580
My brother

522
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,740
is shining like the protagonist

523
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,980
in the article.

524
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,510
My brother is the best.

525
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,120
My brother loves me the most.

526
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,990
But in my heart,

527
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,040
it's like there's a giant black hole.

528
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,630
I am like the invisible supporting character

529
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,280
in an article，

530
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,400
who is rotating and falling in the whirlpool forever.

531
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
I tried my best to find

532
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,130
the meaning of life like you,

533
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,890
and find a dream like that of you,

534
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,790
a righteous brother.

535
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,310
But I couldn't find it.

536
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,890
I don't want you and mom to worry about me.

537
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,350
I can't let you worry about me.

538
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,610
Because you love me so much.

539
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,560
If

540
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,710
I can get a chance to start over,

541
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,500
I will listen to your heart carefully.

542
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,340
I really want to hear

543
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,580
your inner thoughts.

544
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,200
I didn't care about you enough.

545
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,510
If I could have

546
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,640
another chance,

547
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,910
I will live well.

548
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,550
I'll tell you how I feel.

549
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,190
I'll tell you my sadness.

550
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,190
If I want to cry,

551
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,690
I'll call you too.

552
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,050
I will tell you if I can't sleep.

553
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,270
If I'm sensitive and irritated,

554
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,710
I will tell you bravely.

555
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,880
I want to live.

556
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,580
Brother.

557
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,060
I want to live.

558
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,000
I just lost the key you gave me.

559
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,470
But I know

560
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,010
you will open the door for me.

561
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,710
It's not easy for you to live like this.

562
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,840
You have to live on for me.

563
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,620
You still have a lot of life

564
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,360
to go through,

565
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,810
right?
