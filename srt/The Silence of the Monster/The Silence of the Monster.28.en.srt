There must be surveillance in your store.

Yes, there is.

No.

He even tried to bribe me with money.

He wanted to insult Tianhuan's work with money.

I won't agree no matter what.

that this novel was written by Tianhuan.

No.

It's related to your profession.

50
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,310
It's strange.

Yes.

56

His real name is Zheng Xiuyuan.

57
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,450
How did you know?

58
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,820
I didn't know until today.

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,780
I can't help him.

60

Why can't you help him?

61

Why are you helping Jiang Lu?

72
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,930
He plagiarized someone else's work.

73

I can't answer this question.

74

And from now on,

75
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,730
we need to build a barrier between us.

76
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,220
We can't talk about

anything work-related.

78
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,500
Zheng's matter is work-related.

I promise

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,380
I won't ask you

81
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,630
about Zheng.

82
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,610
And you won't ask about Jiang Lu.

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,150
OK?

84
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,730
But why did Jiang Lu

85
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,860
go to your law firm among so many others?

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,370
Because our law firm is excellent.

87
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,820
You...

88
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,420

89
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,750
before the case is closed,

90
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,140
I think it's safer for me to stay

91
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,540
in my room.

92
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,630
So please stop going up to the third floor.

What barrier?

100
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,850
The barrier that Sui Yi set.

101
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,180
She had to take Jiang Lu's case

102
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,940
instead of anyone else's.

103

Isn't she not allowed to take cases yet?

104

Her leader's job is her job.

105
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,970
When did you become so serious?

106
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,500
Jiang Lu.

107
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,670
Who is he?

108
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,670
Did something happen?

109
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,020
The author of this book is called Jiang Lu.

110
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,540
He and Zheng

111
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,490
were good friends ten years ago.

112
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,800
They have a common friend

113
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,580
whose name is Bai Tianhuan.

114
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,010
He died of illness eight years ago.

115
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,400
He left this novel before he died.

116
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,820
Zheng has the manuscript.

117
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,100
But one year ago,

118
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,950
this book was published in the name of Jiang Lu.

119
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,420
But there's another problem with this book.

120
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,570
What is it?

121
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,620
The style of this book has changed a lot in the latter part.

122
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,850
According to Zheng,

123
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,450
the former part of this book was copied from Bai Tianhuan

124
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,250
and Jiang Lu wrote the latter part himself.

125
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,780
Zheng found out later

126
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,730
and sued him for plagiarism.

127
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,710
It was even on the news.

128
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
So Jiang Lu

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
is a client of Sui Yi's law firm now?

130
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,770
Yes, that's right.

131
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,490
That's why she set this barrier.

132
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,400
She said we can't talk about work at home

133
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
to avoid suspicion.

134
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,240
I wanted to ask her for help.

135
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,340
But now,

136
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,370
a friend became an enemy.

137
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,000
When I didn't need her,

138
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,520
she was always against me.

139
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,870
Now I need her,

140
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,980
but I can't even see her.

141
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,580
This is her job.

142
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,870
We have to respect her job.

143
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,080
I'm going to cook.

144
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,180
I'll go with you.

145
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,060
Here, try this.

146
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,770
Last time,

147
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,500
at Zheng's Bookstore,

148
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,970
I saw Curly over there doing the test paper,

149
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,040
scratching his ears and cheeks.

150
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,540
Stop.

151
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,500
I can't even say that?

152
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,060
Fine.

153
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,540
Tell me what I can say.

154
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,970
As long as it has nothing to do with Zheng and Jiang Lu,

155
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,450
it's fine.

156
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,700
OK, Sui Yi.

157
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,320
If... I mean if...

158
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,940
you go to court one day,

159
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,420
what do you think

160
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,460
is most important to you?

161
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,570
To win the case, of course.

162
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,260
Is it because the pay is higher?

163
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,340
No.

164
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,580
As a lawyer,

165
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,560
what I care most

166
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,270
is the sense of glory and justice of winning the case.

167
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,810
The sense of justice is sacred.

168
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,840
The most important thing that lawyers like you

169
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,460
should not lose is the sense of justice.

170
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,200
When a friend is in trouble,

171
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,570
you should offer help.

172
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,700
We should help each other when we're not in trouble,

173
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,230
right?

174
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,650
Stop.

175
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,970
These are two different things.

176
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,580
Sui Yi said

177
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,300
she cares about the sense of justice the most.

178
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,620
Isn't that what you care the most?

179
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,140
I think you two should have a baby

180
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,980
named He Justice.

181
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,580
What do you think?

182
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,010
It's bad for your health to talk while eating.

183
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,430
I didn't see you talking less

184
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,780
when we were eating before.

185
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,860
From now on,

186
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,300
let's change the bad habit.

187
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,100
Fine.

188
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,220
I'll eat.

189
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,380
I'll eat more.

190
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,420
An.

191
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,860
Have some more.

192
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,659
I'm done. I'm going upstairs.

193
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,640
Ask me to clean up after you finish.

194
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,850
You don't have to come down.

195
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,059
Robin will clean it up.

196
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,380
I'll change my name.

197
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,930
Winkle Bin.

198
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,450
It sounds nice.

199
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,780
I'll clean up.

200
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,680
I'm willing to.

201
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,880
I find that both of you

202
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,250
have a strong desire to win.

203
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,370
Birds of a feather flock together.

204
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,620
I don't seem to have the desire to win.

205
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,390
You do.

206
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,650
Not only do you have the desire to win,

207
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,470
but your desire to win is very strong.

208
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,050
I'm not.

209
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,830
When you were like this

210
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,930
with that girl,

211
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,870
and said I'm your boyfriend...

212
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,020
That's not desire to win.

213
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,100
Then what is it?

214
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,780
It's possessive.

215
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,850
I like this word.

216
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,940
Previously,

217
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,650
I hid my identity from you.

218
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,180
I'm so sorry.

219
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I was angry.

220
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,250
But it's all in the past.

221
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,630
I understand you.

222
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,740
Does

223
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,190
your fiancé know you're here?

224
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,360
He's not my fiancé.

225
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,370
At least in my memory,

226
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,570
he is not.

227
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,460
All my memories now

228
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,940
belongs to An.

229
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,410
I just want to do what An wants.

230
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,860
Then...

231
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,120
what does An want to do?

232
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,680
An wants to be with you.

233
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,500
I want to be with you too.

234
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,630
Do you really not mind?

235
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,340
I lost my memory.

236
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,710
I suddenly appeared at your door

237
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,120
and asked you to identify me.

238
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,720
I have a so-called fiancé.

239
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,140
Maybe one day when I remember something,

240
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,790
I'll bring you a lot of trouble.

241
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,100
Maybe one day,

242
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,250
I will forget everything that's happening now

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,020
and become another person.

244
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,620
Do you really not mind?

245
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:40,850
I do.

246
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,750
I don't want to lie to you.

247
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,980
I've envisioned countless outcomes

248
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,230
about you.

249
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,140
I don't mind you losing your memory.

250
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,710
Neither do I mind

251
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,850
you coming to my door to let me identify.

252
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,150
I think

253
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,710
you are a gift from God.

254
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,940
But

255
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,420
I'm afraid that you'll become another person

256
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,860
and go back to your fiancé.

257
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,660
I was afraid that you would disappear completely.

258
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,450
But things in the future are unpredictable.

259
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,120
Instead of worrying about the future,

260
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,370
we should enjoy the moment.

261
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,530
At the moment,

262
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,270
you're here.

263
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,940
Me too.

264
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,860
As long as we are happy.

265
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,480
The most important thing is you're happy.

266
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,910
What is this?

267
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,230
The time of the secret game.

268
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,800
I didn't plan to go.

269
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,360
What?

270
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,050
Are you not interested in the game?

271
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,300
Aren't you curious?

272
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,880
I'm doing fine now.

273
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,260
I pick locks to help others,

274
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,760
not for winning.

275
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,870
He Chufeng.

276
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,270
Let me ask you a question.

277
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,860
Do you still feel happy

278
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,090
when you pick locks?

279
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,860
Every lock you pick now

280
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,100
can be picked in a minute with your eyes closed.

281
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,420
Do you still feel satisfied?

282
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,060
An excellent person

283
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,390
shouldn't hide their light.

284
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,070
Because God is fair.

285
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,980
He will give everyone the talent they are best at.

286
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,190
And you are

287
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,650
the most gifted lockpicker

288
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,120
I've ever met.

289
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,090
I don't want you to lose yourself.

290
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,650
You should stand where you should stand,

291
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,820
where you deserve to stand.

292
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,560
You can fool everyone,

293
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,740
but not yourself.

294
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:43,930
You want to win.

295
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,100
This is you.

296
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,620
Do you want to win?

297
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,300
Yes.

298
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,440
Okay, let's play.

299
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,250
Okay.

300
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,760
Shameless!

301
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:42,210
[I, Zheng Xiuyuan, report Jiang Lu for plagiarism]

302
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,700
Jiang Lu.

303
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,690
I won't let you go.

304
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,570
Hello, everyone.

305
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,770
I'm Zheng Xiuyuan.

306
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,760
I report Jiang Lu

307
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,780
who is the author of this novel.

308
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,480
He plagiarized someone else's work.

309
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,560
The original author of this novel is Bai Tianhuan.

310
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,800
He's a friend of Jiang Lu's and mine.

311
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,810
He passed away eight years ago.

312
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,100
He left this novel manuscript before he died.

313
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,460
Jiang Lu,

314
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,800
as an old friend of Bai Tianhuan's and mine,

315
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,820
has an opportunity to read the manuscript,

316
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,220
but shamelessly

317
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,620
claimed this novel as his own.

318
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,980
Not only that,

319
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,740
he didn't get to see

320
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,100
the complete content of the manuscript,

321
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,980
so from Chapter 15,

322
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,350
he wrote himself.

323
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,340
This can explain

324
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,580
why this novel

325
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,810
has a lame ending.

326
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,740
The former part is wonderful,

327
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,450
but the latter part is shallow.

328
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,240
It is very different in styles,

329
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,340
words and sentences,

330
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,940
and themes from the former part.

331
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,230
What you see now

332
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,770
is the notes Bai Tianhuan left.

333
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,700
I will show you in pictures.

334
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,450
The ending written by Bai Tianhuan

335
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,770
is closely related to the previous content.

336
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,810
It's obvious whether it's true or not.

337
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,650
The ending Bai Tianhuan wrote is shocking,

338
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,980
while Jiang Lu's continuation is unremarkable.

339
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,160
This is the forensic report.

340
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,099
It can prove that the manuscript I'm holding...

341
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:06,660
This is serious.

342
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,579
is Bai Tianhuan's handwriting.

343
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,339
Zheng is doomed.

344
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,920
Also, Jiang Lu.

345
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,780
Don't you just want to see

346
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,890
the ending Bai Tianhuan wrote?

347
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,839
I can tell you

348
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,680
you don't deserve it.

349
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,160
You don't even have the right to take a look.

350
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,690
That's the height you can never imagine.

351
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,060
The statement has been released.

352
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,180
Most of the public opinion and reactions on the Internet

353
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,640
support us.

354
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,640
It shows that our response measures

355
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,570
are still timely and effective.

356
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,260
If he doesn't take another step,

357
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,300
this matter can be settled temporarily.

358
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,860
It won't affect

359
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,370
your planned publicity work.

360
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,860
That would be great.

361
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,570
Is this really okay?

362
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,940
What if he comes to me again?

363
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,010
Judging from the evidence Zheng Xiuyuan presented,

364
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,450
it won't be a threat to you.

365
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:04,860
Of course,

366
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,820
if he takes further action,

367
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,340
we'll deal with it right away.

368
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,020
That means

369
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,500
I have to wait here

370
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,700
for him to mess with me?

371
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,170
Why can't we fight back?

372
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,020
Mr. Jiang,

373
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,280
what kind of counterattack do you need?

374
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,270
Before he sues you,

375
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,940
we don't need to respond to

376
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,790
something that's not true.

377
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,250
Mr. Jiang, don't worry.

378
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,530
We'll keep an eye on the development.

379
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,940
If they make any move next,

380
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,980
we'll take action.

381
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,740
Mr. Jiang,

382
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,380
I have something to do.

383
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,420
Well,

384
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,630
next,

385
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,890
Miss Sui will take over.

386
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,610
Excuse me.

387
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,060
We'll leave now.

388
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,900
Miss Sui,

389
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,460
we're leaving.

390
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,370
Miss Sui.

391
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
There's something

392
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,670
I need to consult you, is it okay?

393
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,600
Sure.

394
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,280
Here's the thing.

395
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,570
I have a question for you.

396
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,100
If Zheng Xiuyuan

397
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,570
comes to me again...

398
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,360
I am

399
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,220
impulsive

400
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,420
and care about old times.

401
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,960
If he...

402
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,230
I mean if...

403
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,460
If he comes to me again,

404
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,390
what should I pay attention to?

405
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,780
Here's the thing.

406
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,130
First of all, you must pay attention to what you say

407
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,060
and avoid physical conflicts.

408
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,780
Secondly,

409
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,190
pay attention to whether there's any

410
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,220
audio and video recording.

411
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,850
Yes.

412
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,330
Audio and video recordings can both be used as evidence.

413
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,190
Of course,

414
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,280
if he comes to you again,

415
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,410
the best way

416
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,370
is to avoid communicating with him face to face.

417
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,350
And try to avoid phone calls.

418
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,270
Evidence?

419
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,300
Mr. Jiang.

420
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,050
Have you talked to Mr. Zheng?

421
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,500
No.

422
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,700
Just in case.

423
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,760
Thank you, Miss Sui.

424
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,980
I'm leaving.

425
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:01,800
So?

426
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,880
I think

427
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,810
he didn't tell us the truth.

428
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,100
At least he didn't tell us the whole truth.

429
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,770
He did not tell the truth.

430
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,270
Mr. Zhou,

431
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,260
you know everything?

432
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,180
He may hide

433
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,400
something unfavorable to himself.

434
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,500
Or even

435
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,770
he did plagiarize.

436
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,260
Are we protecting

437
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,740
someone who might have done something wrong?

438
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,080
It's just possible.

439
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,170
Should we investigate it?

440
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,020
Maybe he did plagiarize.

441
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,420
What can we do

442
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,310
if he did plagiarize?

443
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,920
He's your client.

444
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,340
You're his lawyer.

445
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,370
If your client is a criminal,

446
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,940
won't you defend him?

447
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,850
You've learned all these in school.

448
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,550
Besides, it's just possible now.

449
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,940
I did learn it.

450
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,650
I just didn't expect to encounter this situation so soon.

451
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,380
As I said earlier,

452
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,580
if the other party doesn't take any further action,

453
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,020
this matter can be settled temporarily.

454
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,430
But this is not fair

455
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,450
to Zheng Xiuyuan.

456
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,740
How can you be sure

457
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,170
Zheng Xiuyuan is telling the truth?

458
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,170
For me?

459
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,780
Juice tea.

460
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,580
Have you ever encountered such a situation?

461
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,900
Yes.

462
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,900
The case that Mr. Chen guided me to do

463
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,130
was exactly the same.

464
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,310
Our client

465
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,340
wanted to sue the other party for stealing his equipment.

466
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,940
I thought

467
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,860
he was weird.

468
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,860
I was a little confused.

469
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,170
Do you know what happened?

470
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,120
He stole his own equipment.

471
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,510
He didn't tell me the truth.

472
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,530
How did you know?

473
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,650
I lured him to tell the truth.

474
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,420
What do we lawyers rely on?

475
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,820
The most important is our mouth.

476
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,440
How do I lure him?

477
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,370
You don't know how?

478
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,590
Let me teach you.

479
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,450
Look.

480
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,820
First, you need to analyze

481
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,420
why he didn't tell you the truth.

482
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,810
The reason he refused to tell me

483
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,940
should be he is worried

484
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,250
the truth will harm him.

485
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,240
This may be a reason.

486
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,780
But that's not the main one.

487
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,340
First of all,

488
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,970
you didn't gain his trust.

489
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,960
Secondly,

490
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,390
many clients don't know

491
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,290
the most severe outcome their lies

492
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,400
will lead to.

493
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,380
Most of the time,

494
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,700
our clients haven't

495
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,420
realized the seriousness of the problem

496
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,540
and chose to lie.

497
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,300
Of course.

498
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,580
You can't just say bad things.

499
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,640
We have to say all the good and bad things.

500
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,220
After all, as lawyers,

501
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,150
we can't just memorize

502
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,580
laws and regulations.

503
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,570
We still have to think for the client.

504
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,700
Many times, when we ask a question

505
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,900
in a different way,

506
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,940
the result will be completely different.

507
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,750
Communication with our clients follows this rule.

508
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,350
So does stating and questioning in court.

509
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,720
Did Mr. Zhou tell you these?

510
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,490
How did you know?

511
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,800
I heard it last time.

512
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,100
Have some tea.

513
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,840
This juice tea is quite good.

514
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,450
Right?

515
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,770
I gave it to you last time,

516
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,460
but you didn't drink it. You even despised me.

517
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,540
You break your word.

518
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,960
I didn't know it was so delicious.

519
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,640
It has many other flavors, right?

520
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,180
I'll ask them to leave some for me,

521
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,060
lest they drink it all.

522
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,640
I'm leaving.

523
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,100
Okay.

524
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,020
Hello.

525
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:27,590
Have you eaten?

526
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,350
Yes.

527
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,780
Nothing.

528
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,200
What about you?

529
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,570
What's your plan today?

530
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,610
Are you going out?

531
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,100
No.

532
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,310
I'm stay in today.

533
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,190
See you tonight.

534
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,680
See you tonight.

535
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,430
Bye.

536
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,310
Bye.

537
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,310
I've finished it.

538
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,940
Leave it there. I'll watch it at night.

539
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,740
Where are you going?

540
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,070
I got a call

541
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,600
for fixing a safe.

542
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,070
Hello? Hello?

543
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,780
Jiang Lu plagiarized.

544
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,980
Jiang Lu plagiarized.

545
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,080
Shameless!

546
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Hello?

547
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,020
Jiang Lu plagiarized.

548
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,180
Jiang Lu plagiarized.

549
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,300
Shameless!

550
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:02,770
Robin!

551
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,980
Lend me

552
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,130
Flight on the Island.

553
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,650
There's a barrier between us.

554
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,620
We agreed

555
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,340
not to talk about Jiang Lu and Zheng at home.

556
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,980
That's why I want to read

557
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,310
Flight on the Island.

558
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,300
Otherwise, I have to buy one myself.

559
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,700
The door is over there.

560
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,800
Suit yourself.

561
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,220
Why did you ask him?

562
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,320
This is my book.

563
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,520
Why is this yours?

564
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,350
I bought it.

565
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,180
You are mine.

566
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,690
So this book is mine too.

567
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,180
I'm leaving.

568
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,170
What would you like to drink?

569
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,090
Coffee.

570
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,240
Okay.

571
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,330
Jiang Lu.

572
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,170
Are you forcing me to call the police?

573
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,930
Zheng Xiuyuan.

574
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,180
You actually put this thing

575
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,210
you wrote in a safe!

576
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,900
Bai Tianhuan!

577
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,430
Are you driving me crazy?

578
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,540
Mr. Jiang has been

579
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,170
submitting articles to our press before.

580
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
We knew him.

581
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,540
But there were too many works of the same style.

582
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,830
I kept telling Mr. Jiang

583
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,830
to change his style.

584
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,380
Until last year,

585
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,980
he gave me this work,

586
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,930
I couldn't let it go.

587
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,660
I read it overnight.

588
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,310
I really wanted to know what happened later.

589
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,640
But he only gave me the first half.

590
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,710
The next day, I reported it to the chief editor immediately.

591
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,380
Even if it's not over,

592
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,340
the chief editor decided to sign with Mr. Jiang immediately.

593
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,510
Judging from the current market,

594
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,010
I made the right decision.

595
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,030
Can you sign the contract without an ending?

596
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,390
That's what we do.

597
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,070
If you are late,

598
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,550
good works will be taken away.

599
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,130
I read it last night.

600
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,480
I have a question.

601
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,070
Now netizens are saying

602
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,860
that the style of the ending

603
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,890
has changed.

604
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,170
What's going on?

605
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,410
Here's the thing.

606
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,670
Authors

607
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,220
rely on inspiration.

608
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,980
For one moment,

609
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,150
they suddenly come up with something

610
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,040
and they write it down.

611
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,810
When inspiration passes,

612
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,060
the latter part may not be so good.

613
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,340
But the flaw does not obscure the good.

614
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,580
That doesn't detract from the fact

615
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,860
that it's a perfect piece of work.

616
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,840
TV shows and movies may also have lame endings.

617
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,180
Moreover,

618
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,910
the ending of Mr. Jiang's book is not lame, right?

619
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,940
At most,

620
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,020
it's a little different in style.

621
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,060
Do you have a proofreading script?

622
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,200
Of course.

623
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,470
I made it.

624
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,150
We're like one person

625
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,340
doing the work of many.

626
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,020
I happened to bring it with me.

627
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,060
Mr. Jiang and I

628
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,300
have made an appointment for the next book.

629
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,090
He decided to leave it to me.

630
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:06,840
Take a look.

631
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,230
Thank you.

632
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,200
He hasn't come out all day.

633
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,310
What is he doing in the room?

634
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,320
You're interrupting my work.

635
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,910
I'm being kind.

636
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,220
I'm here to care about you,

637
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,860
you know that?

638
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,090
What are you doing

639
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,030
in your room all day?

640
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,910
Are you in a bad mood?

641
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,480
No way.

642
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,220
Did you quarrel with Sui Yi again?

643
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,660
It can't be.

644
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,230
You even had an appointment with your mother-in-law.

645
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,190
It's about work?

646
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,210
You are He Chufeng.

647
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,080
What Heavenly Lock can stump you?

648
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,870
You're not going to take part in the secret game

649
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,630
of writing letters in blood, are you?

650
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,820
No.

651
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,140
Then what are you doing?

652
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,480
Listen.

653
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,260
I've checked the game.

654
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,030
It's dangerous.

655
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,200
If you go,

656
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,720
you might never come back.

657
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,820
I know you like challenges.

658
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,410
And your desire to win is strong.

659
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,220
But as your friend,

660
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,080
I have to remind you again.

661
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,630
You can't do this.

662
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,240
You think too much.

663
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm not going to the secret game.

664
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,220
Then what are you doing?

665
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,860
I'm going to compete

666
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,020
with Gu Nan.

667
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,220
Gu Nan?

668
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,850
Why are you competing with him?

669
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,900
Didn't you ask me

670
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,100
to ask him about the secret game?

671
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,010
So I went.

672
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,420
He asked me if I wanted to join.

673
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,830
I said no.

674
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:14,860
Yeah.

675
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,820
Does this have anything to do

676
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,580
with your competition?

677
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,010
I think you just want to

678
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,860
compete with someone.

679
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,950
You're just like your master.

680
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,490
You are both competitive.

681
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,140
But didn't you say

682
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,980
your master hasn't picked locks for a long time?

683
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,490
Why are you two competing?

684
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,610
Are you trying to bully him?

685
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,060
This is not your style.

686
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,560
Since he mentioned it,

687
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,660
it means

688
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,580
he's fully confident.

689
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,350
We locksmiths

690
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,250
often compete and learn from each other.

691
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,120
It's normal.

692
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,590
We used to be like this.

693
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,180
Are you sure you can win?

694
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,610
I'll do my best.

695
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,450
So don't bother me if nothing happens.

696
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,570
And don't bother me if anything happens.

697
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Solve it yourself.

698
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,210
Okay, I got it.

699
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,020
There's a barrier on the third floor.

700
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,150
There is also a barrier on the second floor.

701
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,320
There is no place for me

702
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,179
in such a big room.

703
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,969
Should I ask again?

704
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,159
He might agree to go out.

705
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,429
Do you want to go to the supermarket with me?

706
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,460
That was close.

707
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,460
Luckily, I hid fast.

708
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,280
Fine.

709
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,540
I'll go by myself.

710
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,659
OK, Mr. Zhou.

711
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,350
I see.

712
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,980
When I see him later,

713
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,020
I'll talk to him in a proper way.

714
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,510
OK. Bye.

715
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:47,820
Miss Sui.

716
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,110
Mr. Jiang.

717
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,510
Mr. Jiang.

718
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,630
We've sorted out

719
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,840
what happened.

720
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,980
Although Mr. Zheng

721
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,170
hasn't taken any further actions

722
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,070
for now.

723
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,670
But this matter

724
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,630
has stirred up a storm online.

725
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,540
And now the public opinion

726
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,420
is fermenting very fast.

727
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,240
The netizens

728
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
are sensitive

729
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,180
and attentive

730
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,300
about plagiarism.

731
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,260
Things are changing rapidly.

732
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,060
So if we can't

733
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,570
solve this problem in time,

734
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,210
if anything else happens,

735
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,700
it may damage your reputation.

736
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,300
How can we solve it quickly?

737
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,590
Mr. Jiang,

738
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,240
if you don't tell us the truth,

739
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,810
we can't help you.

740
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,480
If things have not changed

741
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
and no action

742
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,690
has been taken on Zheng's side,

743
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,820
no matter what the truth is,

744
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,140
it can be bygones.

745
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,700
But

746
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,610
once Mr. Zheng has issued

747
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,520
any evidence against you,

748
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,910
we can't handle it.

749
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,250
There may be serious consequences.

750
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,900
What serious consequences?

751
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,370
I'll just lose some money.

752
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,560
-Hello. -Hello.

753
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,070
Two iced Americanos.

754
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:25,710
OK.

755
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,690
Sui Yi.

756
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,700
Miss Sui,

757
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,420
what serious consequences could there be?

758
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,780
You may be held responsible for criminal crimes.

759
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,780
That means you might go to jail.

760
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,870
Go to jail?

761
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,340
Really?

762
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:51,710
Yes.

763
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,990
So, Mr. Jiang,

764
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
I really suggest you

765
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,840
tell us

766
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,070
the truth.

767
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,940
Here's the thing.

768
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,560
Aren't you not allowed to see clients alone?

769
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:48,860
Why did you meet Jiang Lu?

770
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,290
What did he tell you?

771
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,900
Can you buy me another iced Americano?

772
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,130
Add more ice.

773
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,680
What did he say?

774
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,330
What did he say?

775
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,970
Just tell me a little.

776
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:09,980
No.

777
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,970
I'm in a mess.

778
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,220
Hello, what would you like to drink?

779
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:14,980
Hello.

780
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,890
Americano, less ice.

781
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,210
Forget it.

782
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,040
Without ice.

783
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:18,860
Okay.

784
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,860
Tell me.

785
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,940
I'll tidy it up for you.

786
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,320
I promise to keep it a secret.

787
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,090
No.

788
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,840
The ending Bai Tianhuan wrote is shocking,

789
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,110
while Jiang Lu's continuation is unremarkable.

790
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,210
Don't you just want to see

791
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,300
the ending Bai Tianhuan wrote?

792
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,180
I can tell you

793
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,020
you don't deserve it.

794
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,360
You don't even have the right to take a look.

795
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,820
That's the height you can never imagine.

796
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,460
Thank you.

797
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,710
What are you going to do next?

798
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,500
Who are you?

799
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,750
Why are you here?

800
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,570
Kid.

801
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,370
What's your name?

802
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,280
Curly.

803
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,570
Curly.

804
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,620
I'm Zheng Xiuyuan's good friend.

805
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,130
He asked me to get something for him.

806
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,440
But he didn't tell me where it was.

807
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:19,760
It's a pile of manuscripts.

808
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,780
Have you seen it?

809
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,980
Yes.

810
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,860
Where is it?

811
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,000
He's really anxious.

812
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,590
I see.

813
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,550
I prefer this ending.

814
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:47,990
Me too.

815
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,650
He's been carrying a bag with it every day lately.

816
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,500
Did he forget

817
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,360
to bring it today?

818
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,340
Yes.

819
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,120
So he's very anxious.

820
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,210
Look for it yourself.

821
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,090
How much have you read?

822
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,370
I finished reading.

823
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,140
Then why are you still reading it?

824
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,320
The third time.

825
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,130
What do you think

826
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,020
of this book?

827
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,410
Not bad.

828
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,370
I think the latter part is more interesting.

829
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,030
Can you tell me

830
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,800
what is interesting?

831
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,090
It's just quite interesting.

832
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,450
But many people say

833
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:19,970
the latter is worse than the former.

834
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:23,880
Don't you think so?

835
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,580
Sir.

836
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,610
Don't you know there's a saying that

837
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,950
there are a thousand Hamlets

838
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,690
in a thousand people's eyes?
