00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,470
Really?

340
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,140
Han,

341
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,250
I have to take a look.

342
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,550
No, no, no.

343
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,110
Don't get me into trouble please.

344
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,580
Besides,

345
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,810
it's useless to go there.

346
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,810
There's a lock on it.

347
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,540
Lock?

348
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,530
Just unlock it. It's easy.

349
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,700
It's not that easy.

350
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,460
That lock is very strange.

351
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,070
Once people get close to it,

352
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,560
they feel cold.

353
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,150
Besides,

354
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,700
the key was long gone.

355
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,740
Besides, so many things happened.

356
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,700
No one dares to act recklessly now.

357
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,830
We don't want to break it.

358
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,960
Except Mr. Meng,

359
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,970
no on knows what is inside it.

360
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,220
For this hot potato,

361
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,070
our whole museum is dying of worry.

362
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,940
I think you need me more after heard what you said.

363
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:34,690
Wait.

364
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,540
How are you going to unlock this lock?

365
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,940
Do you know how much it is worth?

366
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,510
This is the last works of Dong Li.

367
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,750
So I don't need to tell you

368
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,300
about its value, right?

369
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,140
Those who used to unlock the lock

370
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,250
said they need to use hammer and saw

371
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,980
to open it.

372
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,950
If you plan to unlock it like this,

373
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,090
I suggest you give up.

374
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,140
If you break the stuff inside it

375
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,410
when you unlock it,

376
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,210
I won't be able to sell it.

377
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,130
Curator Meng,

378
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,110
don't worry.

379
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,470
Mr. He is a master in unlocking.

380
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,920
He will open it perfectly for you.

381
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,370
Yes, I see.

382
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,730
The person you introduced must be professional.

383
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,510
Right?

384
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,520
But I still

385
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,770
feel uneasy.

386
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,580
I wonder if my dad

387
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,750
is warning me something.

388
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,820
So...

389
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,310
Do you want to unlock it or not?

390
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,480
Yes. Unlock it.

391
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,490
Whatever.

392
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,410
Is this lock a bird?

393
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,380
This is the magpie lock.

394
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,520
A magpie?

395
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,850
Why did they use the magpie shape on the lock?

396
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,400
The ancient locks are usually made with animal shape.

397
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,260
The decoration and meaning are combined

398
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,000
into its original function.

399
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,060
The magpie lock is a kind of animal-shaped lock.

400
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,950
A magpie?

401
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,800
So it's related to love?

402
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,120
There were many wars in ancient times.

403
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,910
Couples were often separated.

404
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,550
Magpies represent the meeting of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl on the Magpie Bridge.

405
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,910
So wives sometimes made the magpie locks,

406
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,720
hoping their husbands would come back safely.

407
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,740
Then...

408
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,080
It sounds good.

409
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:45,980
Lucky.

410
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,970
Curator! Curator!

411
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,830
Curator.

412
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,620
I heard that there seems to be

413
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,500
other legends about the magpie locks.

414
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,510
Something else?

415
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,060
What do you mean?

416
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,940
In ancient times,

417
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,700
some women specially

418
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,290
locked themselves in the room with the magpie locks

419
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,980
at midnight of Qixi Festival.

420
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,010
If the lock was opened the next day by itself,

421
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,150
it would mean her husband can come back safely.

422
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,780
Wait a minute.

423
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,780
If the lock was unlocked,

424
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,270
her husband would come back safely.

425
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,980
What if the lock was not open?

426
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,180
What would happen?

427
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,660
If it wasn't opened,

428
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,990
people inside the room would gradually despair,

429
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,190
and eventually fall ill and die of depression.

430
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,090
That's why the magpie locks

431
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,950
always symbolize meeting in the Netherworld.

432
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,570
The lock could be opened by itself?

433
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
How could that happen?

434
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,380
What's more, what if that woman

435
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,170
died,

436
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,140
but her husband came back later?

437
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,910
I heard it from someone else.

438
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,460
Maybe it's just a legend.

439
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,660
Bad luck.

440
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,660
Why did my dad

441
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,370
collect such a thing?

442
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,260
Locks have no good or evil.

443
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,430
Only humans have various misfortune.

444

Chufeng.

445
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:28,710

446
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,280
Chufeng.

447
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,870
Brother Chufeng.

448

456

He Chufeng?

457
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,449
He Chufeng?

458
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,120
He Chufeng?

459
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:37,920
Mr. He.

460
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:38,889
How is it?

461
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,130
Can you open it?

462
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:42,560
Sorry.

463
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,530
I can't open it today.

464
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,620
What's wrong?

465
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,350
This lock is not an ancient lock.

466
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,679
It's a modern mimicking lock.

467
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,310
How is this a mimicking lock?

468
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,980
You said it was an ancient lock just now.

469
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,080
Although it looks like a magpie lock from ancient times,

470
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,470
it's actually made by modern craftsmanship.

471
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,140
Fine.

472
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,520
We have to unlock it

473
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,120
whether it's ancient or not.

474
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,840
Otherwise, no one will buy it.

475
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,470
I can't open it today.

476
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,840
I need time to prepare.

477
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,800
No, I...

478
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,580
Iced Americano.

479
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,660
Double ice.

480
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
Isn't diluted with double ice?

481
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,240
That's why I ordered double caffeine.

482
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:33,750
Are you awake now?

483
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,680
I saved your life today.

484
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,640
Don't deny it.

485
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,980
You asked me to open the lock.

486
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,090
It's because

487
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,780
you like weird things.

488
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,520
So I told Han to let you have a look.

489
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,850
What do you think?

490
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,090
The lock is so weird.

491
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,590
How about giving it up?

492
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,090
No, I want to open it.

493
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,050
Did you find something?

494
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,120
Give it to me.

495
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,780
Is there really a ghost?

496
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,530
I'll talk to Han later

497
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,190
to increase our charge.

498
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,100
I almost lost you.

499
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,550
If the greedy me

500
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,120
was also get into the idolum,

501
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,160
that would be a big loss.

502
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,330
Where are you going next?

503
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,460
I...

504
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,870
go out for dinner.

505
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,190
Okay.

506
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,070
It's fulfilling.

507
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,410
Bye.

00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,980
What kind of person is Robin?

510
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,850
Robin?

511
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,380
He's long-winded

512
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,730
and annoying.

513
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,220
As for his hobbies,

514
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,210
I really don't know.

515
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,040
He seems to love blind dates.

516
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
It's not that I love blind dates.

517
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,260
I have no choice.

518
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,530
Hello, Mr. Robin.

519
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,810
I'm the daughter of the classmate's of

520
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,170
Aunt Luo's neighbor's colleague.

521
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,650
Hello, I'm Robin.

522
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,730
My mom asked me to come.

523
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,060
Hello.

524
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,700
Hello, I'm Robin.

525
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,600
My mom asked me to come.

526
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,360
To be honest,

527
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,790
I don't want to go on a blind date.

528
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,770
I'm here to complete the task.

529
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,700
Me too.

530
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,440
My mom asked me to come.

531
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,540
I heard that appraisers

532
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,180
have a lot of gray income.

533
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,020
Some clients

534
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,790
may let you tamper with

535
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,460
the appraisal report.

536
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,390
Is that true?

537
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,980
What would you say

538
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,900
if I want you to appraise my purse?

539
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,470
I won't lie about this.

540
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,230
Miss Liu,

541
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,290
your purse

542
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,500
is fake.

543
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,660
I suggest that you should buy less

544
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
at the curated stores in the future.

545
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,770
Although I'm here to complete the task,

546
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,730
I think you're quite good.

547
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,020
Have you really never been in a relationship?

548
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,530
It shouldn't be so,

549
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,000
I think

550
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,560
you should be quite popular.

551
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,240
Actually,

552
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,030
I've never been in a relationship too.

553
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,540
I think we are a good match.

554
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,610
Why don't we give it a try?

555
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,920
I've never been in a relationship.

556
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,250
I don't like to lie about this.

557
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,370
Miss Huang,

558
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,880
I don't think it's necessary for you to lie.

559
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,350
My world is simple.

560
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,750
It's only made up of real and fake ones.

561
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,980
My job is to distinguish them.

562
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,900
What do you mean?

563
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,770
You mean I lied?

564
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,650
What's wrong with you?

565
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,650
Are you blaming me for not being liked?

566
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,330
No.

567
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,400
I mean

568
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,570
love is sacred and simple.

569
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,530
Sincerity and love at first sight are both important.

570
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,660
Insane!

571
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,120
What the hell!

572
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,170
I...

573
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,130
I'm shy.

574
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,660
Don't be nervous.

575
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,810
It's no big deal.

576
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,550
Not good at communicating

577
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,150
is not something unforgivable.

578
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,620
I have a friend who isn't good at communicating.

579
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,670
But he's a good listener.

580
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,570
Then I'll will be the one who talks.

581
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,370
I have mysophobia for the real and fake.

582
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,530
I have mysophobia for love too.

583
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,300
I believe in love at first sight.

584
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,780
Because I think I am like

585
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,480
a cracked egg.

586
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,340
When I'm put in a pile of eggs,

587
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,030
I don't look any different.

588
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,640
But I clearly know

589
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,960
I'm different from them.

590
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,660
Although I want to hide

591
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,890
the huge crack on me,

592
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,550
it's always there.

593
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,930
Do you know in butterflies' eyes,

594
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,980
humans have wings in their hearts?

595
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,540
Because when they meet their love,

596
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,190
the heart will fly out.

597
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,020
Although it sounds naive,

598
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,200
don't laugh at me about what I'm gonna say.

599
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,020
I think love is occasional.

600
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,000
There's no pattern or trace.

601
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,810
If one day

602
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,260
I meet someone I like,

603
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,830
my heart will beat faster.

604
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,260
And there will be birds spinning in my head.

605
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,400
They will sing songs that make me excited.

606
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,750
There will be 100 butterflies

607
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,120
in my stomach, flapping their wings.

608
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,120
