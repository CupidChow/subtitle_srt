5
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,910
I will decorate

6
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,500
my room in a few days.

7
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,060
There's no need for that.

8
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,539
You're just in a relationship.

9
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,220
Maybe you'll break up in a few days.

10
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,060
It'll be troublesome to move if you have too many things.

11
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:48,979
Mom.

12
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,620
Let's go downstairs and take a walk.

13
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,340
Sui Yi.

14
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,100
Tell me seriously.

15
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,670
Do you really like him?

16
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,660
Mom.

17
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,060
I really like him.

18
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,110
How is it?

19
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,260
What did Sui Yi's mother ask?

20
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,320
She asked me about my zodiac sign and blood type.

21
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,050
Sui Yi's mother is quite fashionable.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,040
What else did she ask?

23
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,090
She also asked me about my family.

24
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,130
You told her the truth?

25
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,780
Do parents

26
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,060
usually care about this?

27
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,230
Of course.

28
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,170
Who doesn't love their children?

29
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,930
Think about it.

30
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,630
She's been worried about her child for over 20 years.

31
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,710
But now,

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,200
her child has a boyfriend.

33
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,940
She's been worried about her for over 20 years.

34
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,340
How could she stop?

35
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,570
She will naturally

36
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,620
focus on

37
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,660
the boyfriend of her child.

38
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,579
Do you think what I said makes sense?

39
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,560
Will she really mind that?

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,940
If you were her, would you mind that?

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,780
I'm not your mother-in-law.

42
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,240
And I've never been a parent.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,250
Why should I worry?

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,280
You worried a lot.

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,520
That's true.

46
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,060
But my worries are different from

47
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,930
parents' worries.

48
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,540
I don't know who said

49
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,440
he worried about what a father worried about.

50
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,140
He Chufeng.

51
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,060
At this time,

52
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,300
you still have

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,710
a scary desire to win?

54
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,570
Do I

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,060
have a desire to win?

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,540
Of course.

57
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,470
Is it obvious?

58
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,380
If you haven't realized it,

59
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,180
it means you don't have a clear idea

60
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,660
of who you are.

61
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,170
By the way,

62
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,440
who else asked you that?

63
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,610
Sui Yi's mother.

64
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,960
Her mother is not simple.

65
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,210
What should I do

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,030
if she really minds that?

67
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,510
Use your confidence to win.

68
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,130
Take it as the most difficult thing

69
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,170
in your work.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,170
The most difficult one.

71
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,150
Think about it.

72
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:58,940
When you have to

73
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,420
open a safe that you think is the most difficult to open,

74
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,440
what's the one thing you can't lose?

75
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,860
I've never met the most difficult one.

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,470
That's not the point.

77
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,540
Think about it.

78
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,370
If there was,

79
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,140
what would be the one thing you can't lose?

80
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,060
Confidence.

81
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,360
Right.

82
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,980
Belief in winning is the key to success.

83
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,820
Take it as the most difficult thing

84
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,700
in your work.

85
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,980
A safe that is the most difficult to open.

86
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,250
Remember,

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,860
you are the best locksmith.

88
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,450
There's no lock that you can't undo.

89
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,490
This matter is the same with undoing locks.

90
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,340
There's no mother-in-law that can't be convinced.

91
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,980
As long as you find the right method

92
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,159
and the password,

93
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,780
everything will be solved.

94
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,380
Understood.

95
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,510
What's the password?

96
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,530
Think about it.

97
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,550
They went downstaris.

98
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,500
Can you show me around

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,380
your studio?

100
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,200
Ma'am.

101
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,580
Sui Yi.

102
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,980
I have something

103
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,180
to talk to him alone.

104
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,400
Ma'am.

105
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,409
ThIs door is very soundproof.

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:03,900
Sui Yi.

107
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,530
As a lawyer,

108
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,660
how can you eavesdrop?

109
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,860
Go away.

110
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,820
Is your mother a politics teacher?

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,760
No.

112
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,180
Why did you introduce us

113
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,060
like you were reading a politics textbook?

114
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,330
My dad is a politics teacher.

115
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:27,780
Hello, ma'am.

116
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,700
Let's go.

117
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,250
What did she say to you?

118
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,920
When you meet your girlfriend's parents next time,

119
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,460
I can teach you.

120
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,340
An.

121
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:53,850
Hello, ma'am.

122
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,570
All right, I won't stay any longer.

123
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,020
Mom.

124
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,060
Are you leaving now?

125
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,430
Ma'am,

126
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,830
why don't you stay for lunch?

127
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,620
I can cook.

128
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,510
Yes, mom.

129
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,040
Chufeng is good at cooking.

130
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,300
Your dad made these sausages for you.

131
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,960
Can you make sausages?

132
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,390
Yes.

133
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,300
My daughter likes them.

134
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,140
I know how to make them. Don't worry.

135
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,370
I won't have lunch here.

136
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,250
All right.

137
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,060
I've seen what I should see.

138
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,460
The atmosphere here is good.

139
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,970
Lively and earnest.

140
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,140
United and alert.

141
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,510
You have what young people of the new era

142
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,670
should have.

143
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,490
What are they?

144
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,580
Dreams, morals,

145
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,190
knowledge and discipline.

146
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,710
That's what I meant.

147
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,580
Your dad is indeed a good teacher.

148
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,980
Sui Yi.

149
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,450
You and An are girls.

150
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,030
You have to take good care of yourselves.

151
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,000
Understood?

152
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,780
After all, you two girls

153
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,580
live together.

154
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,659
You should live together well.

155
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,570
Mom, don't worry.

156
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,220
An and I

157
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,610
will live together well.

158
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,770
Ma'am,

159
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,690
let us give you a ride.

160
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,610
No need.

161
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,360
I called a taxi.

162
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,020
Don't forget our promise.

163
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm leaving.

164
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,080
Be good.

165
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,810
-Okay. -Bye.

166
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,920
See you.

167
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,419
You don't have to see me off.

168
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,500
Just stay here

169
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,480
and get on with your work.

170
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,800
What did my mom say to you?

171
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,880
It's a promise.

172
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,620
I can't tell you.

173
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,730
Why can't you tell me?

174
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,020
She's my mom.

Honesty

179

Right.

186

Sui Yi, you are a lawyer.

187

You also have to fulfill such legal obligations.

Are we having Sausage and Rice for lunch?

192
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,300
The sausages made by my father are really delicious.

193
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,100
You have to cook them well.

Nothing.

It's all because of you.

Don't be angry, okay?

204
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,270
Don't think that I'm love-struck.

205
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,180
No, I don't.

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,420
I'll ask around if you want to go.

342
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,050
I'm not interested.

343
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,010
It's good not to go.

344
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,140
But getting this letter

345
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,860
is already the greatest recognition

346
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,720
for your skill.

347
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,740
Chufeng.

348
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,860
You're amazing.

349
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,000
You told me

350
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,990
that undoing locks is not about winning or losing.

351
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,980
But being with outstanding competitors

352
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,700
will greatly improve

353
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,160
your professional ability.

354
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,340
In my opinion,

355
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,260
you should go.

356
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,380
Let me think about it.

357
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,400
He said he wanted to think about it.

358
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,020
What's there to think about?

359
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,380
Sir,

360
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,420
can you help me find out the date of the game?

361
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,820
My stupid friend

362
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,960
burned the part about the date.

363
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,450
Do you want to go alone?

364
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,590
I was supposed to go.

365
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,619
I'm just a few years late.

366
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,260
It's not late.

367
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,780
Anyone can go as long as they can get

368
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,240
this letter.

369
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,290
But what I'm more curious about is

370
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,890
who is more worth going.

371
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,109
You or him?

372
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,680
I will let him give me the letter on his own initiative.

373
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,410
Why did Sui Yi's mother come here suddenly?

374
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,070
Because she was worried about her.

375
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,260
It seems Sui Yi didn't tell her mother she and He Chufeng

376
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,610
are in a relationship.

377
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,610
How did her mother know?

378
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,350
Mothers' intuition and radar

379
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,060
can't be explained by science.

380
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,810
What about fathers?

381
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,000
Usually, fathers don't come to their daughters immediately.

382
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,010
They always ask their daughters' mothers to do that.

383
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,190
But if fathers

384
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,580
know their daughters are in a relationship,

385
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,520
they can't calm down.

386
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,220
Even if they beat around the bush,

387
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,020
they're determined to know what they want to know.

388
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,200
After all,

389
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,610
daughters were their lovers in their past life.

390
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,290
And fathers cherish their daughters the most.

391
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,420
But I don't think he cares about me.

392
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,620
He didn't look for me when I was missing.

393
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,070
I didn't see him when I went back.

394
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,300
Every parent cares about their children

395
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,180
in different ways.

396
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,300
Maybe your father

397
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,700
is just not good at expressing himself.

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,320
Are you close to your father?

399
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,420
Which father

400
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,130
do you mean?

401
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,850
I'll take the call.

402
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,380
Qiqi.

403
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,260
You are finally willing to take the call.

404
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,930
Did you sleep well?

405
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,130
I'll pick you up.

406
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:25,920
It's okay.

407
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,200
I want to stay here for a few days.

408
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,060
I bought you a new mattress

409
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,100
and incense.

410
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,290
They can help you sleep well.

411
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,500
I said

412
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,720
I want to stay here for a few days.

413
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,690
Don't go to my house anymore.

414
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,090
Did my dad contact you?

415
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,260
No.

416
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,200
Mr. Fang is still abroad.

417
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,970
He's always like this when he's busy.

418
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,390
When will he come back?

419
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:54,850
I'm not sure.

420
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,940
What's wrong?

421
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:57,950
Nothing.

422
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,630
Don't call me again these days.

423
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,810
I'll contact you if I want to go back.

424
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:03,960
Also,

425
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,170
I'm not your fiancee now.

426
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,000
[Dad]

427
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,100
If you don't marry him,

428
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,380
you won't be my daughter anymore.

429
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,050
Wen.

430
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,440
What did she say?

431
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,860
She said she will stay there for a few days.

432
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,700
Did she remember something?

433
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,810
Didn't you hear what Wen said?

434
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,310
She can't remember anything.

435
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,060
Right, Wen?

436
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,440
This is not the most important thing.

437
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,220
Mr. Fang will be back soon.

438
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,380
We have to bring Qiqi back

439
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,330
before he comes back.

440
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,820
What if she remembers something

441
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,330
and tells Mr. Fang...

442
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,760
Listen.

443
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,450
We can't let this happen.

444
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,300
Understood?

445
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:29,700
Yes.

446
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,380
What are you doing?

447
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,220
I'm identifying it.

448
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,740
This book is a little strange.

449
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,460
The first half of the book is well-structured,

450
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,050
and the words are restrained and gentle.

451
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,020
But they're very imaginative.

452
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,260
The author seemed to plan something big.

453
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,920
Although the end of the book

454
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,760
follows the foreshadowing,

455
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,580
I still feel that there is something strange.

456
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,640
I have to investigate it online.

457
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,270
Is this author so controversial?

458
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,440
Readers,

459
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
you're all blinded.

460
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,970
This novel is not Jiang Lu's own creation.

461
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,710
He plagiarized

462
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,870
another person's work.

463
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,050
The real author of this novel is Bai Tianhuan.

464
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,260
What Jiang Lu did

465
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,820
is blatant plagiarism.

466
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,460
Nonsense!

467
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,780
Liar!

468
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,740
Kick him out!

469
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,620
Don't believe him.

470
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,700
He plagiarized another person's works.

471
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,340
Liar!

472
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,540
I have to ask Zheng.

473
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,260
Xiuyuan.

474
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,820
I've told you.

475
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,320
There must be some misunderstanding between us.

476
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,260
You misremembered.

477
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,550
It's been so long.

478
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,800
It's not what you think.

479
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,660
Okay.

480
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,620
No matter what,

481
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,460
delete those posts

482
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,860
on the Internet first.

483
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,660
Does the matter of the three of us

484
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,140
have to be known

485
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,900
by everyone?

486
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,820
You may not know much about the Internet.

487
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,910
It's very dangerous.

488
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,180
If you don't pay attention,

489
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,180
the whole thing will be out of control.

490
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,420
Be careful not to be taken advantage of by someone else.

491
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,930
Delete them first.

492
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,110
I won't delete them.

493
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,860
Zheng Xiuyuan.

494
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,130
You've changed.

495
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,120
You weren't like this before.

496
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,540
You weren't like this before.

497
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,320
You know better than anyone

498
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,570
who wrote this novel.

499
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,390
This is Bai Tianhuan's work,

500
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,570
not yours.

501
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,030
Tianhuan is dead.

502
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,140
Pick them up.

503
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,180
Sorry.

504
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,810
Tianhuan is the most talented

505
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,990
among the three of us.

506
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,000
He wrote such a good book

507
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,380
and never published it.

508
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,200
Don't you think it's a pity?

509
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,960
Have you forgotten?

510
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,800
At that time, Tianhuan kept saying

511
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,810
that his greatest wish

512
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,670
was to have his works seen by others,

513
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,060
no matter what method he should use.

514
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,670
It's still his work,

515
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,050
not yours.

516
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,930
What you did is blatant plagiarism.

517
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,200
Only living people have value.

518
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,050
If this book was published in Tianhuan's name,

519
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,260
he wouldn't have chance

520
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,450
to show up.

521
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,810
I have business value.

522
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,380
I can not only publish it,

523
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,130
but also win

524
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,150
a contest.

525
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,700
I can also adapt it for the screen.

526
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,330
Tianhuan will be very happy.

527
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,400
Aren't you happy?

528
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,140
Isn't this our dream?

529
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,180
Ridiculous.

530
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,150
That's sophistry.

531
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,570
You're distorting the truth

532
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,500
and calling black white.

533
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,660
Get out of my way.

534
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,880
You have the manuscript

535
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,330
of the second half of the novel, right?

536
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,480
Stop hiding it.

537
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,530
Look at your small bookstore.

538
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,970
How much money do you make a year?

539
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,290
Give me the manuscript of the second half.

540
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,260
Name your price.

541
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Don't you want to publish books?

542
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,790
I'll introduce you to a good publisher

543
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,100
and a good film and television production company.

544
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,980
Your dream.

545
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,740
Our dreams.

546
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,920
We can actualize them together.

547
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,580
Listen, Jiang Lu.

548
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,980
Not everyone does everything

549
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,240
just for the benefit like you do.

550
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,930
Jiang Lu.

551
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,680
I have evidence that you plagiarized another person's work.

552
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,140
Either you admit it yourself

553
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:51,900
and apologize,

554
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,080
or you wait for your reputation

555
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,950
to be ruined.

556
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,320
You're just jealous of me.

557
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,900
You can't write good works,

558
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,500
so you don't want me to live a good life

559
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,370
and be popular.

560
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,830
Let me tell you, Zheng Xiuyuan.

561
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,600
You

562
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,330
want to give me trouble?

563
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,090
Don't even think about it.

564
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,220
Get out of here.

565
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,780
Don't mess up my store.

566
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,500
Get lost!

567
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Let's wait and see.

568
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,060
Get lost!

569
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,860
What happened just now?

570
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,830
Is he the one who's been talking about online?

571
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,540
Yes.

572
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:44,970
What...

573
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:53,160
[Zheng's Bookstore]

574
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,240
What's wrong?

575
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,280
It's just what they said online.

576
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,900
So this is the reason why you asked me

577
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,700
to identify the handwriting?

578
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,140
Yes.

579
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,540
You know this author?

580
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,460
His name is Jiang Lu.

581
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,390
Ten years ago, I, he and Bai Tianhuan

582
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,300
were good friends who wote together.

583

[Ten Years Ago]

584
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,470
Writing makes me feel lonely.

585
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,780
Because I was obsessed with words,

586
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,810
I gave up many things.

587
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,690
But because of writing,

588
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,310
I can find myself in the words.

589
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,650
I often have no inspiration.

590
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,830
I hope God

591
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,420
can give me more inspiration.

592
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,970
The process of waiting for inspiration

593
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,020
is depressing and painful.

594
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,920
I was pathetic and humble

595
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,380
back then.

596
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,520
But when I

597
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,670
was inspired,

598
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,200
all the waiting was worth it.

599
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,700
Writing makes me full of passion.

600
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,220
Because it can make me live

601
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,180
in my own imagination,

602
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,810
where I can be enthusiastic

603
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,690
without worries.

604
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,270
Thank you.

605
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,830
Thank you.

606
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,070
Actually, I think we can

607
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,890
communicate more like this in the future.

608
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,460
How about we exchange contact information with each other?

609
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,770
OK. Give me your phone number.

610
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,270
Okay.

611
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,330
What's your phone number?

612
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,980
1423...

613
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,760
Wait a moment.

614
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,770
Bai Tianhuan

615
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,260
is the most talented one among us.

616
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,290
Writing is not a job,

617
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,100
a profession,

618
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
or a hobby for him.

619
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,450
Writing

620
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,900
is his life.

621
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,230
Stop drinking.

622
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,480
You'll feel uncomfortable.

623
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,550
Don't stop me.

624
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,820
I want to drink.

625
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,190
Do you think those stupid publishers

626
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,300
know novels?

627
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,880
My work is so good.

628
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,580
They insisted that

629
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,520
my work was not profound

630
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,660
and was soulless.

631
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,130
It's normal.

632
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,330
Look at me.

633
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,230
My works have also been rejected for many times.

634
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,900
Now,

635
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,500
I don't even wish to

636
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:24,950
publish them.

637
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,780
It would be nice if I could publish a few articles

638
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,140
in newspapers or magazines.

639
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,300
That's you.

640
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,870
We are different.

641
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,530
You think too much.

642
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,100
Don't interrupt me.

643
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,480
Let me finish.

644
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,260
OK.

645
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,270
Go ahead.

646
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,780
Then,

647
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,700
I changed it according to their requirements.

648
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,590
I tried my best to make it profound.

649
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,940
Then...

650
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,060
Guess what these idiots said.

651
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,810
They said my work was remote from life.

652
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,740
Profound.

653
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,540
Life.

654
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,670
You're drunk.

655
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,360
They bullied me because I'm not popular.

656
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,810
If I became popular,

657
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,100
they would think it's good, no matter what I write.

658
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,290
Don't care too much about it.

659
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,020
Literature.

660
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,730
Business.

661
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,020
They're totally different.

662
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,290
Your work is not published.

663
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,810
That doesn't mean your work is not good.

664
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,310
You can find

665
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,630
that many works

666
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,890
are remote from reality.

667
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,410
Do you want me to leave the world alone?

668
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,940
If my works

669
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,600
can't be published

670
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,290
when I'm alive,

671
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,220
do I have to wait until I die?

672
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,790
What's the point?

673
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,390
If your works are written for yourself,

674
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,850
it's true that

675
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,090
you should be known by others

676
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,040
when you're alive.

677
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,770
But

678
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,740
if your works

679
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,270
are written for this era,

680
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,610
it's never too late to be known.

681
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,080
Here.

682
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,710
However, talents are not lucky.

683
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,140
Within two years,

684
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,850
Bai Tianhuan was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.

685
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,680
Why did you get up?

686
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,090
Stop writing.

687
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,750
It's only been a few days since you had surgery.

688
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,409
Your wife will scold me if she sees what you're doing.

689
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,940
I'm not the one who'll be scolded.

690
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:14,889
You...

691
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
She's your wife.

692
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,760
She'll scold you.

693
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,320
But you're my best friend.

694
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Hurry up. Take the medicine first.

695
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,980
Stop hiding it.

696
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,360
It's me.

697
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,010
You scared me.

698
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,420
Tianhuan.

699
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,260
What amazing novel are you writing?

700
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,500
The idea of this story

701
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,780
was conceived

702
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,750
when I was 16.

703
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,980
I wanted to write it slowly

704
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,290
and modify it slowly.

705
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,710
I wanted to publish it when I'm 50.

706
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,100
But now it seems

707
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,340
too late.

708
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,620
So,

709
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,890
I have to hurry.

710
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,220
What are you talking about?

711
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,370
The doctor said

712
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,940
as long as you stick to chemotherapy,

713
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,570
you'll be fine.

714
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,250
The medical treatment is so advanced now.

715
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,190
I saw online the other day that

716
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,810
in the future, even chips

717
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,040
can be implanted into the human body.

718
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,420
Right.

719
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,580
Don't talk nonsense.

720
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,370
Drink more water.

721
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,090
Tianhuan.

722
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,340
Do you want a computer?

723
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,940
Using computers to write is not tiring.

724
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,900
You can write faster.

725
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,500
No.

726
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,670
I get inspired when I write with my pen.

727
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,810
What if you lose your manuscript

728
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,440
one day?

729
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
I've sorted it.

730
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,060
I won't lose it.

731
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:06,470
Don't worry.

732
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,940
What story are you writing?

733
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,250
Later, when I was packing up Tianhuan's belongings after he died,

734
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,020
I saw his last manuscript

735
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,420
and took it away.

736
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,860
I've been keeping it for him.

737
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,620
But last year...

738
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,840
Jiang Lu finally published a book.

739
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,540
Even this belly band

740
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,460
was designed by Tianhuan.

741
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,560
How could he be so shameless?

742
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,810
Did you look for Jiang Lu later?

743
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,410
Of course I did.

744
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,500
I thought about him at first.

745
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,040
I didn't want to make a big deal of it.

746
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,450
I was wondering if there was a misunderstanding.

747
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,920
After all, it was not easy for him to publish a book.

748
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,490
I went to see him many times.

749
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,120
He refused to meet me.

750
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,780
Until that day,

751
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,060
I went to the book signing event of Jiang Lu

752
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,600
and found him.

753
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,380
I wanted to know what happened.

754
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,020
But he said, "I'm sorry.

755
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,250
I don't know you."

756
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,790
He gave me the runaround.

757
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,700
Before he left, he smiled and said,

758
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,730
"Thank you for liking my book."

759
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,280
Tell me.

760
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,320
A plagiarist

761
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,100
enjoys honor

762
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,310
and admiration openly.

763
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,800
But the real author

764
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,360
doesn't even have the right to continue writing novels.

765
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,660
Is that fair?

766
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,450
Later, I also went to the publisher.

767
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,300
But people there ignored me.

768
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,920
Those people are in cahoots

769
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,150
with Jiang Lu.

770
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,500
[Flight on the Island]

771
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,830
This is the last work left by Tianhuan.

772
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,420
Regardless of our friendship,

773
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,180
he stole it.

774
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,060
I must ask him to return it.

775
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,500
He just came to me and said

776
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,690
he wanted to buy the manuscript I kept.

777
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,620
How could he be shameless?

778
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,230
Wait.

779
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,860
He came to buy the manuscript.

780
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,320
Then how did he plagiarize it before?

781
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,980
I don't know.

782
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,650
We rented a house together before.

783
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,970
I don't know how he got it.

784
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
I was shocked too.

785
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,640
The point is his ending doesn't match Tianhuan's good story.

786
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,250
Bai Tianhuan wrote such a good story.

787
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,730
But he continued it and made it bad.

788
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,510
That's why I came to you.

789
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,260
An and I think the first half of the book

790
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,130
is totally different from the second part.

791
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,690
What can Jiang Lu write?

792
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,790
Is there CCTV in your store?

793
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,020
Yes.

794
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,650
Yes, there is.
