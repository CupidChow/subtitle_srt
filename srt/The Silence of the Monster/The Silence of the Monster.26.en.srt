[I hate people lying to me, but I hate myself lying to others even more.]

5
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,670
You saw me at the museum.

6
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,740
Why didn't you come and say Hi?

7
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,729
Why did you ignore me?

8
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,759
I don't want to disturb you and your fiancé.

9
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,470
I couldn't sleep well

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,860
when I was back these days.

11
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,320
I just want to come back and have a good sleep.

12
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,390
I'm gonna go upstairs.

13
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,500
Why

14
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,770
can't I help but doubt?

15
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,260
Once I had a mistake,

16
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,340
the next time I encounter similar things,

17
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,630
I will instinctively

18
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,840
think of the bad result.

19
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,820
When did I become like this?

20
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,690
Why can't I

21
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
believe it like I did

22
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,680
at the beginning?

23
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,740
Should I believe it?

24
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,520
You're here.

25
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,310
How long do you need?

26
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,230
I've been waiting for the right time.

27
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,269
Waiting for the right time?

28
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,089
Until when?

29
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,730
What are you doing everyday?

30
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,140
Do you really think you're a dishwasher?

31
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,570
Do you feel happy?

32
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,700
You've been having fun

33
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,310
since you came out.

34
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,970
You didn't do anything serious.

35
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,560
Are you here enjoying your retirement?

36
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,260
I didn't pay you for nothing.

37
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,720
I've been waiting for a chance.

38
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,490
But he doesn't

39
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,100
trust me 100%.

40
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,380
If you can't do it,

41
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,690
just give up.

42
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,040
I can do it.

43
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:58,970
What?

44
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,770
I can do it!

45
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,690
Good.

46
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,120
Don't forget who took everything away from you.

47
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,550
You have to get it back.

48
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,170
Bro,

49
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,760
I got you something.

50
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,280
I put it downstairs.

51
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,210
I won't charge you much this time.

52
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,780
Just 300 yuan.

53
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:44,940
Thank you.

54
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,700
Bro,

55
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,820
did you get it wrong?

56
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,070
It's 300,

57
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,340
not 200.

58
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,810
You're wrong.

59
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,370
Just 200.

60
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,100
200?

61
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,270
200? Are you dreaming?

62
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,080
Bro,

63
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,340
you kept this warehouse quite clean.

64
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,630
Bro,

65
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,260
why do you buy second-hand safes?

66
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,620
Isn't this...

67
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,530
Isn't it the one I got you last time?

68
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,430
You said you wanted to hide someone in it.

69
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:34,740
How's it going?

70
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,850
Did you hide anyone in it?

71
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,260
Well…

72
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,220
It seems too small for it.

73
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,760
No one can hide in it.

74
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,400
Fine.

75
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,330
I must get you

76
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,350
a bigger one that can hide a person.

77
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,140
But you have to pay the deposit first.

78
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,500
I'll charge you 200 this time.

79
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,280
Okay?

80
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,690
Did you drive here?

81
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,070
Yes, I drove here.

82
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,120
That's good.

83
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,240
I've found a place to hide you.

84
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,440
You can't threaten me anymore.

85
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,280
Only the dead

86
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,640
can keep secrets forever.

87
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:39,460
[I have something to do. I'll be back at noon. Breakfast is in the kitchen. Remember to eat.]

88
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:39,460
[Remember to close the front door. Don't let Bean Bun and his girlfriend go out.]

89
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,140
Be good. Don't fight.

90
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,330
Calm down.

91
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,190
Don't come out.

92
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,710
Do you have a video of cat abuse?

93
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,300
I really didn't do that.

94
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,410
I saw it that night,

95
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,900
so I took a video.

96
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,410
How dare you scratch my dress!

97
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,910
How dare you scratch my dress!

98
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,280
Cats are bad.

99
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,620
You're bad.

100
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,190
I'm leaving tomorrow anyway.

101
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,250
I'm not afraid to say it.

102
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,760
You got injured on your forehead

103
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
when you argued with your boss

104
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,270
last night, right?

105
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,830
This necklace

106
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,860
must be given by your boss, right?

107
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,700
I understand

108
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,910
you don't like cats.

109
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm not forcing you

110
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,170
to like cats.

111
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,530
But this matter

112
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,370
has caused a panic

113
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
to our community.

114
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,750
We need to make the wrongdoer

115
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,020
pay for it.

116
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,570
How did you know the clerk

117
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,810
has the video of her boss?

118
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,700
Because Sui Yi

119
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,840
got allergies last time

120
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,860
after drinking their milk tea.

121
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,900
Sui Yi is allergic to cat hair.

122
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,860
Although she got much better after taking the medicine,

123
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,260
when she came back,

124
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
she passed by the owner of that shop.

125
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,230
There must be a lot of cat hair

126
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,150
on the owner.

127
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,450
It seems I didn't pay enough attention to Sui Yi.

128
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,430
You were heartbroken.

129
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,790
I see.

130
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,290
Zheng,

131
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,090
I have something to tell you.

132
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
I was looking for you.

133
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,010
What's wrong?

134
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,860
What's the matter?

135
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,430
I got the verification results.

136
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,020
Thank you.

137
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,960
What verification result?

138
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,370
The handwriting verification institution

139
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,240
you recommended

140
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,380
is reliable.

141
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,620
It's not a big deal.

142
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,540
By the way,

143
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
could you do me a favor

144
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,980
and tell something to the whole neighborhood?

145
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,390
Come out!

146
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Come out!

147
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,140
How come there's someone so cruel?

148
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:11,620
Right.

149
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,280
I even bought milk tea from her shop.

150
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,460
It makes me feel disgusted just thinking about it.

151
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,350
I'm back.

152
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,190
I saw it in the group chat.

153
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,980
It turns out the cat abuser

154
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,310
is the owner of that milk tea shop.

155
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,240
Yes.

156
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,680
Is there any problem with her milk tea shop?

157
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,880
There's a big problem.

158
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,660
It has been held accountable

159
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,820
for using expired ingredients

160
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,540
to make milk tea.

161
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,180
Great.

162
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,430
She deserves it.

163
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,340
Their milk tea is really poisonous.

164
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,860
Whoever drinks it will break up.

165
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,710
But I have to say something.

166
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,210
Sui Yi.

167
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,740
You are really healthy.

168
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,640
I'm not feeling well right now.

169
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,130
I feel nauseous. I want to throw up.

170
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,920
I think I need to drink some probiotics.

171
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,670
Let me drink it for you.

172
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,210
Where's Chufeng?

173
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,330
He went to work.

174
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:33,960
Hello.

175
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,480
Is He Chufeng here?

176
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,040
He's not here now.

177
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,750
Why are you looking for him?

178
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,410
I see.

179
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,050
He'll be back soon, right?

180
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,030
It's okay. I'll wait for him.

181
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,990
You must be his friend,

182
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:51,870
right?

183
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,380
It's okay. I'll leave you to your work.

184
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm just looking around.

185
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,120
Please take a look.

186
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,260
I'll call you if I need anything.

187
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,750
Bean Bun.

188
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,480
Why did you lose weight?

189
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,340
Are you on a diet?

190
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,480
Who is this?

191
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,130
A friend?

192
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,520
Why didn't he tell me?

193
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,490
Hello, Monster Vintage.

194
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,790
Okay.

195
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,300
I'll tell him when he comes back.

196
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,280
Bye.

197
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,210
You'd better explain it to me

198
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,850
when you come back later,

199
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,710
or I'll knock you down again.

200
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,240
Xia Shi.

201
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,420
Robin.

202
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,550
When did you come back?

203
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,540
Long time no see.

204
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,220
I just came back.

205
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,400
I came here as soon as I arrived.

206
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,180
Good for you.

207
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,780
Robin, is this your friend?

208
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,770
Are you hungry? Are you thirsty?

209
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,060
I'm hungry and thirsty.

210
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,540
Sui Yi.

211
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,300
Go get some food.

212
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:45,670
Go.

213
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,500
Thanks!

214
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,260
Robin, you look prettier.

215
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,820
Really?

216
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,500
Thank you.

217
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,640
You're tall and handsome now.

218
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,830
Of course.

219
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,780
What have you been up to?

220
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,580
Nothing.

221
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,780
I just came back.

222
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,610
I have some work to do.

223
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,420
Fengfeng.

224
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,220
Why are you here?

225
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,820
How have you been?

226
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,870
Not too bad.

227
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,150
Honey.

228
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,530
You're back.

229
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,220
It's okay.

230
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,650
You...

231
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,330
What's wrong?

232
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,850
Honey.

233
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,220
Why are you talking to me like that?

234
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,820
Haven't I always been like this?

235
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,290
Sui Yi.

236
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,770
Do you have a fever?

237
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,340
Robin.

238
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,190
Why do you suddenly care about me?

239
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,800
Honey, you must be tired.

240
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,460
Have some water.

241
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,290
Isn't this water for Xia Shi?

242
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,550
Here.

243
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,410
Okay.

244
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,700
Fengfeng.

245
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,300
I forgot my keys

246
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,260
this time when I'm back.

247
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,730
Could you open the door for me later?

248
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,340
No problem.

249
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,240
Miss Xia Shi,

250
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,970
remember to bring the key

251
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,070
next time when you're away.

252
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,200
Otherwise, it'll be troublesome.

253
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,090
It's okay.

254
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,500
Fengfeng will always open the door for me.

255
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,610
I suggest you switch to a password door,

256
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,390
then you won't be afraid to forget your keys.

257
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,900
But Fengfeng said

258
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,710
the traditional lock is safer, right?

259
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,040
Fengfeng really knows something.

260
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,250
Silly girl.

261
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,860
Let me introduce her.

262
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,420
This is the last tenant of the vintage store.

263
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,330
Her name is Xia Shi.

264
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,420
Let me introduce myself.

265
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,820
Hello, I'm Xia Shi.

266
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,630
Hello.

267
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,260
There used to be personal visitors

268
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,250
to Monster Vintage,

269
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,660
just like you guys living here.

270
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,530
I lived here for three years.

271
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
You lived in the attic, right?

272
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
I used to live there too.

273
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,860
But later,

274
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,220
my room was occupied by Chufeng.

275
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,560
So you never won in any battle.

276
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,410
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

277
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,410
What matters is the process.

278
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,220
Sui Yi.

279
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,850
I came here today

280
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,930
to ask you a favor.

281
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,170
Me?

282
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,840
I'm gonna go.

283
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,540
See you.

284
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,340
Anytime you want.

285
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,850
The timing of meeting is important.

286
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,910
When the time is right,

287
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,100
meeting is meaningful.

288
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,060
Bye.

289
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,460
Bye.

290
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,100
Bye.

291
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,770
I'm going upstairs to see An

292
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,630
and see if she's awake.

293
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,920
Hello?

294
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,570
Is this Zheng Xingchuan?

295
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,900
Hello?

296
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,750
Monster Vintage.

297
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,940
Sui Yi.

298
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,980
Did you find

299
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,260
a white cat?

300
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,440
Yes, Aunt Liu.

301
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,060
Do you know whose cat it is?

302
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,880
That's my Angel.

303
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,340
My son just bought it.

304
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,100
I don't know when

305
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,980
it escaped.

306
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,870
When can you

307
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,060
come and pick it up?

308
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,940
Or…

309
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,980
Or we can send it to you.

310
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,530
It's okay.

311
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,250
I'll pick it up later.

312
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,410
By the way,

313
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,849
I have something to ask you.

314
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,220
Is Gu Nan at Song's shop

315
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,250
the master of Chufeng?

316
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,710
Yes.

317
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,780
Chufeng is a good kid.

318
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,770
His master went to jail before,

319
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,230
but he's willing to vouch for him.

320
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,140
He's very loyal.

321
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,830
We misunderstood him this time.

322
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,770
We thought he was the one who abused the cat,

323
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,380
but he actually saved a cat.

324
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,640
The owner of that shop was the one who abused the cat.

325
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,560
We can't judge him

326
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,330
just because he made a mistake.

327
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,960
Right?

328
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,590
Why didn't you tell us

329
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,700
about your teacher?

330
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,250
I could handle things with him.

331
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,210
If I had told you,

332
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,320
it would only cause you trouble.

333
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,500
This is not something

334
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,480
you could decide for us.

335
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,260
It is not the reason for you to hide it from me.

336
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,810
As your girlfriend,

337
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,390
I have the right to know.

338
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,020
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

339
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,010
I just thought

340
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,430
I didn't need to explain it to you.

341
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,350
Just like

342
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,810
you didn't tell your mom

343
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,150
about our relationship.

344
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,020
This is not the same thing.

345
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,640
It's not that I don't want to tell my mom.

346
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,310
I just didn't find the right time.

347
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,500
But your teacher

348
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,620
has met us.

349
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,740
We often talked about him.

350
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,060
You never told us

351
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,150
such an important thing.

352
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,330
Did you treat us as strangers?

353
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,460
You should tell us

354
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,420
honestly.

355
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,850
Now the whole neighborhood knows

356
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,940
except your best friend

357
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,340
and your girlfriend.

358
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,580
Have you considered our feelings?

359
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,910
Let me correct it.

360
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,880
I'm the last one.

361
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,800
You're the second last.

362
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,240
I won't let his matter

363
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,630
affect you.

364
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,120
I promise.

365
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,140
He Chufeng.

366
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Are you a fool?

367
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,380
Are we worried about ourselves?

368
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,180
We're mad at you.

369
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,580
Are you afraid we'll treat him differently

370
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,220
if we know his story?

371
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,570
Don't you trust us at all?

372
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,360
Robin.

373
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,820
Your best friend,

374
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,860
my boyfriend,

375
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,800
thinks we don't deserve to be trusted.

376
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,190
He Chufeng.

377
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,540
I can promise you

378
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,270
I didn't hide anything from you.

379
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,380
Although I didn't tell my mom

380
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,210
about our relationship,

381
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,080
I've always been honest with you.

382
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,060
Ask Robin if you don't believe me.

383
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,940
He's your best friend.

384
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,580
You didn't hide anything from He Chufeng either,

385
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:29,970
right?

386
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,760
How can I not be angry?

387
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,820
I'm the last one in the neighborhood to know.

388
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,200
I can understand.

389
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,740
This is not something easy

390
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,900
to talk about.

391
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,980
But friends

392
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,300
should be honest with each other.

393
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,090
I didn't make it

394
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,370
before,

395
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,630
so I felt sad.

396
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,840
According to the book,

397
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,610
betrayal starts from

398
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,350
secrets between people,

399
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,450
especially between friends.

400
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,140
I think

401
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,030
this is why Sui Yi and Robin are angry.

402
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,780
An is right.

403
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,400
That's it!

404
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,760
Robin.

405
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,210
We treat him as our friend.

406
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,400
Tell us.

407
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,400
You didn't hide anything from He Chufeng either,

408
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:09,910
right?

409
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,450
No.

410
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,070
Look.

411
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,300
This is what a real friend should be.

412
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,110
I'll explain his thing to you clearly,

413
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,080
but please give me some time.

414
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,070
You...

415
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,850
What?

416
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,730
You still don't understand

417
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,740
why I'm angry.

418
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,340
Bean Bun.

419
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,720
What's wrong?

420
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,710
Are you still thinking about Chufeng?

421
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,580
An.

422
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,890
Do you hate people lying to you?

423
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,080
Yes.

424
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,650
I hate people lying to me,

425
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,310
but I hate myself lying to others even more.

426
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:41,810
Well…

427
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,580
What if it's something beyond control?

428
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,190
It depends on who the person is.

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm not sleepy.

513
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,430
Sure you're not sleepy.

514
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,510
You've been sleeping all day.

515
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,380
Can you fall asleep tonight?

516
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,460
I can still fall asleep

517
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,370
if I force it.

518
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,830
I wish I were you.

519
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,280
What's wrong with you?

520
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,020
It's all because of

521
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,900
He Chufeng.

522
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,690
He's dull.

523
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,260
First, it's the love letter,

524
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,400
now it's his teacher.

525
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,780
I don't know how many things

526
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,320
he's still hiding from me.

527
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,970
Why can't he understand?

528
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,290
I don't care about what his teacher did at all.

529
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,980
The fact that his teacher was in jail

530
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,040
is not a big deal to me.

531
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,210
What I care about is that he hid it from me

532
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,150
without telling me anything.

533
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,220
No explanation at all.

534
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,740
Maybe that's his personality.

535
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,420
Some people tend to

536
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,300
bear everything on their own.

537
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,090
But I don't need him to bear it alone.

538
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,010
We're in a relationship.

539
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,460
Aren't we supposed to share the burden together?

540
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Whether it's happiness

541
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,540
or sadness,

542
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,580
we can face it together.

543
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,840
He Chufeng

544
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,670
is so stupid.

545
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,160
Are you happy with him?

546
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,750
Of course,

547
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,420
but it's more than happiness

548
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,610
when two people are together.

549
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,510
There are lots of other things.

550
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,910
Is there more happiness or unhappiness?

551
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,250
Happiness, of course.

552
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,720
Then it's good.

553
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,120
It is important to be happy.

554
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,350
You're right.

555
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,430
Time to sleep.

556
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,420
Sleep.

557
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,220
But I'm still very angry.

558
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,410
An.

559
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,570
Talk to me more.

560
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,810
Time to sleep.

561
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,820
You'll get wrinkles if you're angry.

562
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,700
Anyway, I don't want to get it.

563
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,360
Good night.

564
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:10,810
Wrinkles.

565
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,350
Good night.

566
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,550
But I'm still so angry.

567
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,950
My mom is coming.

568
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,690
Go get changed.

569
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,170
What?

570
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,300
Robin.

571
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,420
Hurry!

572
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,140
Why did you wake me up so early?

573
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,080
My mom is coming.

574
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Get changed and go downstairs.

575
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,550
Why do you ask me to go downstairs when your mom comes?

576
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,410
Listen to me.

577
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,250
Don't wear

578
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,100
fancy clothes.

579
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,540
You must dress like a normal person.

580
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,660
I'm a normal person.

581
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,930
No, not enough.

582
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
Don't let my mom think

583
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,000
that I live in such an absurd place.

584
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,570
You must be upright,

585
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,580
kind and righteous.

586
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,690
You need to look like a good young man in the new century.

587
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,800
Good morning, An.

588
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,980
What are you waiting for?

589
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,420
Get changed! Go!

590
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,390
Robin, go inside.

591
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:04,760
Okay.

592
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,190
Mom.

593
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,470
Let me introduce

594
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,380
my roommates to you.

595
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,580
You are

596
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,620
that smart and rational auctioneer?

597
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:38,820
Nice to meet you, Madam.

598
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,390
Mom.

599
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,450
They are...

600
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,570
You are the appraiser

601
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,130
who likes verifying humans?

602
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,360
What's his name?

603
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,240
Robin.

604
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,820
Is he the locksmith you mentioned?

605
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,010
Nice to meet you, Madam.

606
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,280
Oh no.

607
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,620
What about He Chufeng?

608
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,240
Sui Yi's mom came out of the blue.

609
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,500
I don't even have time to prepare.

610
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,080
Prepare for what?

611
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,000
I need time to teach him

612
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,570
how to talk to her parents.

613
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,060
Like what you can say and what you can't.

614
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,210
I need to predict

615
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,560
what Sui Yi's mom will ask,

616
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,560
and prepare perfect answers.

617
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,260
I'll predict various situations

618
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,970
and think of countermeasures.

619
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,720
Looks like you have a lot of experience in meeting parents.

620
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,540
No.

621
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,810
Not even once.

622
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,340
Really?

623
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,340
I saw you in a video in Sui Yi's phone.

624
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,970
Didn't you want to tell me in person?

625
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,370
So I came here.

626
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,520
Mom,

627
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,990
this is my boyfriend, He Chufeng.

628
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,120
Although we haven't known each other for long,

629
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,540
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

630
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,860
I was going to

631
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,160
to tell you and dad

632
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,980
when I go home for Spring Festival.

633
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,300
Well,

634
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,160
what is your zodiac sign?

635
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:53,940
Aquarius.

636
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,110
Sui Yi is an Aries.

637
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,140
Aquarius and Aries

638
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,100
don't quite match.

639
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:03,660
Mom,

640
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,210
since when did you start believing in zodiac sign?

641
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:07,960
Recently.

642
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,480
I think zodiac signs are quite interesting.

643
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,000
For example, an Aquarius

644
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,750
is ambitious.

645
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,940
They like to be stronger than their partner.

646
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,110
And you Aries

647
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,940
tends to bully the weak and fear the strong in love.

648
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,670
Be careful.

649
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,390
Mom,

650
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,300
zodiac signs are different among people.

651
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,970
What's his ascendant?

652
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,730
What is ascendant?

653
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,550
I don't know.

654
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,380
Look it up.

655
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,890
Your ascendant is Pisces.

656
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,910
Someone whose ascendant is Pisces

657
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,140
does like a whirlwind romance.

658
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,190
They also break up quickly.

659
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,450
Madam,

660
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,460
I might have misremembered

661
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,170
my birth time.

662
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,680
I'll check it again when I'm free.

663
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,030
What's your blood type?

664
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,880
Type A.

665
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,510
Mom.

666
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,330
Chufeng has the same blood type as you.

667
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,810
Blood type A is very loyal, right?

668
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,030
I'm not loyal.

669
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,520
Does my dad know that?

670
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,900
Blood type A is very loyal.

671
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,150
I've checked this.

672
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,820
Since when did you start knowing blood type?

673
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,260
Alright.

674
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:04,830
I got it.

675
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,750
What does your family do?

676
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,970
Do they live in the same city?

677
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,740
My family passed away.

678
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,100
My mother died in a fire.

679
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,010
My sister committed suicide because of depression.

680
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,580
My dad died in a car accident.

681
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,000
Madam,

682
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,660
I didn't mean

683
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,500
to hide my family background from you.

684
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,220
I also know

685
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,430
I haven't known Sui Yi for long.

686
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,730
My job is special.

687
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,110
I totally understand

688
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,300
if you have any concerns.

689
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,060
To be honest,

690
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,220
I am nervous meeting you for the first time today.

691
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,010
I'm worried that I can't live up to your expectations.

692
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,550
Sui Yi is excellent.

693
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,660
She's upright, kind,

694
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,000
and cute.

695
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,980
She has changed me little by little

696
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,260
even since I met her.

697
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,739
I really think

698
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:17,510
I'm lucky to know her.

699
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,889
Take me to your room.

700
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:48,800
You...

701
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,860
How many floors are there in total?

702
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,090
Three. Three.

703
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:16,950
Not bad.

704
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,710
It's clean.

705
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,550
How do you and An

706
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,110
sleep here?

707
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,600
We sleep together.

708
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
You two sleep together?

709
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,930
But you can't stay like this forever.

710
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,440
An won't stay here forever.

711
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,100
Even if she stays here for a long time,

712
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,780
we can think of another way.

713
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,230
I know.

714
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,830
You always think about others,

715
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,540
but you two girls

716
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,180
sleeping together...

717
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,940
Don't kick off the blanket at night.

718
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,260
Be careful not to catch a cold in winter.

719
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,030
Got it, Mom.

720
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,420
I'll take care of myself.

721
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,240
Don't worry.

722
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,400
I'm your mom.

723
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,080
I'll always care about you.

724
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,660
How are you?

725
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,140
How is your work?

726
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,170
Pretty good.

727
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,750
It's good.

728
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,870
Really good.

729
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,180
My bosses are great.

730
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,530
I also get along well with other colleagues.

731
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,130
Then…

732
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,440
How's the case going?

733
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,080
I'm still an apprentice lawyer.

734
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,280
There are things I don't fully understand,

735
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,030
but I'll keep learning anyway.

736
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,610
You are still young.

737
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,130
It's good to try more.

738
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,940
It doesn't matter if you're tired someday.

739
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,420
It doesn't matter

740
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,940
if there's a gap between dreams and reality.

741
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,870
There are many possibilities in life.

742
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,620
Anyway, you can always go back home.

743
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,200
Mom,

744
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,500
don't worry about me.

745
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,080
I really like this law firm

746
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,410
and my current job.

747
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,150
Anyway, this is my decision.

748
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,130
Okay.

749
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,040
As long as you're happy.

750
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,710
I know.

751
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,860
Now,

752
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,610
I'm very satisfied with my current work.

753
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,560
I'm good living here.

754
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,660
I plan to

755
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,220
redecorate my room these days.

756
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,130
There's no need for that.

757
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,290
You two are only dating.

758
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,990
Maybe you'll break up soon.

759
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,880
It's hard to move if there are too many things.

760
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:24,930
Mom.

761
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,390
Let's go downstairs and take a walk.

762
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,010
Sui Yi.

763
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,780
Seriously, tell mom,

764
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,570
do you really like him?
