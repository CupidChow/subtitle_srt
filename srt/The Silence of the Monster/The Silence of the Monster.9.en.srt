Is it so hard for you to find her for me?

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,100
Mr. Wang,

38
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,540
I've explained to you many times.

39
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,340
Your fiancee left you a message, right?

40
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,620
Yes.

41
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,140
You also said that you are not married.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,180
-No possibility of coaxing you into marriage. -Not married.

43
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,100
Maybe she's mad at you.

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,460

Well...

68

I went home after the party was over.

69
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,800
But she's already gone.

70

I searched everywhere.

71
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,220
She's gone.

72
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,140
She is missing.

73

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,659
Have a seat, please.

80
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,730
That kind of situation is normal.

81
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,340

let alone the police station.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,580
It's all about love.

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,450
Do you know the fear of marriage before getting married?

85
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,500
It's possible that they just left

86
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,170
because they couldn't reach an agreement.

87
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
Maybe she'll be back in several days.

88

Help me comfort him.

89
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,590
The old man just pissed me off.

90
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,500
Mr. Wang.

91
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,040
Don't worry.

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,670
We'll find her.

93
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,220
Did you contact the orphanage?

94
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,800
What orphanage?

95
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,040
Okay.

96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,430
I know.

97
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,020
Thank you.

98
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,320
She never told me this.

99
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,120
Didn't you ask her

100
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,150
which orphanage she grew up in?

101
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,530
I think

102
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,650
she didn't want to talk about the past things,

103
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,640
so I didn't ask.

104
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,700
Why do you only care about your feelings?

105
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,550
Did you ask her how she felt?

106
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,930
Why are you wearing this?

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Easter?

108
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,260
I went to a themed exchange meeting

109
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,060
of the interstellar team.

110
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,180
Right, you're an alien.

111
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,020
What I want to ask is

112
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,620
how often you two communicated.

113
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,980
Communicate?

114
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,720
Frequently.

115
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,420
We talked to each other every day.

116
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,810
Talking is

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,970
not the same as communicating.

118
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,780
What did you usually talk about?

119
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I said, for example...

120
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,870
You bought so many things.

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,220
Come on,

122
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,180
I've prepared dinner for you.

123
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,070
You must be hungry today.

124
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,970
I made all your favorite dishes today.

125
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,990
I just bought them today.

126
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,730
They're very fresh.

127
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,870
Come on.

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,690
Hurry.

129
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,300
I've had some outside.

130
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,350
You have?

131
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,080
I told you not to eat outside.

132
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,470
The food outside is not hygienic.

133
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,150
Sit down and eat more.

134
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,170
Wipe your hands.

135
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,840
I told her we have an appointment of taking wedding photos  next Wednesday.

136
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,740
8 a.m.

137
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,120
Remember to ask for leave.

138
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,540
Remember to ask for leave in advance.

139
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:55,870
Got it.

140
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,900
Eat more carrots.

141
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,730
I asked her to eat more vegetables.

142
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,180
They are good for her skin.

143
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,760
She said

144
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,020
I know.

145
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,840
I just want her to live a better

146
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,740
and comfortable life.

147
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,740
Let's confirm the number of attendees as soon as possible.

148
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,230
This is not communicating.

149
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,410
Why?

150
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,050
She replied.

151
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,700
Right.

152
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,620
You've been sending signals unilaterally.

153
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,860
Although she replied,

154
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,570
did she proactively send you any message?

155
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,860
It's like she really lives on the Earth,

156
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,870
but you're in the outer space.

157
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,400
Did you ask her

158
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,370
what she had experienced

159
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,170
before she met you?

160
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,070
I think she will tell me

161
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,170
if she wants to.

162
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,330
If you ask her,

163
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,890
you might get a response.

164
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,740
But if you don't ask,

165
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,780
with Li Yun's personality,

166
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,470
she would never tell you.

167
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,790
What happened between you

168
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,090
before she left?

169
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,260
Nothing.

170
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,580
We just had a meal together.

171
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,180
We said nothing special.

172
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,540
I asked her

173
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,090
if she's tired

174
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,920
and told her to rest early.

175
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,280
I asked her if she's hungry.

176
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,850
I've cooked some dishes.

177
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,580
I asked her if she needs money.

178
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,380
I'll transfer some to her.

179
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,740
Then she asked me

180
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,810
whether I'm curious about her

181
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,669
and I can just ask her.

182
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,750
I said I'm not curious.

183
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,240
If you're curious about me,

184
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,179
just ask me.

185
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,620
She's taken the initiative

186
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,820
and wanted you to ask her questions.

187
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:44,530
And

188
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
you asked me to verify

189
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,840
if she's an alien,

190
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,050
but you blocked her signals yourself.

191
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,330
What should I do?

192
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,200
I...

193
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,930
I can't live without her.

194
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,820
We are getting married.

195
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,620
I love her.

196
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,270
My Olive.

197
00:08:59,410 --> 00:08:59,850
Okay.

198
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,280
We'll help you find her.

199
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,370
Calm down.

200
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,710
Then tell me what to do.

201
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,610
Does she not love me?

202
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,930
Does she not love me?

203
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,430
Am I unable to see her?

204
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,220
I don't think so.

205
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,620
Li Yun

206
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,240
cared about her appearance very much.

207
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,140
She's also an excellent medical student.

208
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,400
But when you met her,

209
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,740
she was plain

210
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,280
and worked in an art store.

211
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,660
You always think that you are the same kind of people.

212
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,610
The one you like

213
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,190
is the person who discussed about a parallel world with you.

214
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,500
But for her,

215
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,420
that's just part of her.

216
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,220
So gradually,

217
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,230
you found that she started to like to dress up.

218
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,500
She wore a dress

219
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,550
but she didn't show it in front of you.

220
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,250
You think she has changed.

221
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,870
But to her,

222
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,820
she's just trying

223
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,710
to find her old self.

224
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,960
Because she saw

225
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,620
Professor Jiang who paid for her education

226
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,840
die in a car accident with her own eyes.

227
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,140
So she left the university

228
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,790
and gave up her identity as a medical student.

229
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,300
When she was lost and helpless,

230
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,020
she desired an explanation of a parallel world.

231
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,010
Right?

232
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,390
They went to that world.

233
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,090
But I believe one day

234
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,300
there will be a chance

235
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,310
for them to come back to us.

236
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,400
You just said

237
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,830
there is a parallel world, right?

238
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,900
Only in this way can she feel relieved.

239
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,240
The person she misses

240
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,350
can live in another parallel world.

241
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,840
She started to smile

242
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,710
when taking photos.

243
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,060
There's also a key on the door.

244
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,740
You did change her.

245
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,280
Then why did she leave me?

246
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,620
Maybe there is another

247
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,850
door waiting to be unlocked in her heart.

248
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,480
Wang Wenxin.

249
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,540
You keep saying you're an alien.

250
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,740
Your astronomical suit is made on the Earth.

251
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,340
Is it expensive?

252
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,220
It's not about the price.

253
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,700
My Olive bought this for me.

254
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
So you aliens

255
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,780
know romance.

256
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,760
When I first met her,

257
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,090
we were so happy.

258
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,370
I think...

259
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,340
I think I met the one

260
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,110
who acknowledges me

261
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,640
and likes me.

262
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,670
She's just like me in all aspects.

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,170
But later I found

264
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,540
she had many secrets that she didn't want to tell me.

265
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,590
I don't have the courage to ask her.

266
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,980
I really don't.

267
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,020
I tried my best

268
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,060
to make her happy in my own way,

269
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,690
but I still made a mistake.

270
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,040
You did nothing wrong.

271
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,300
It's just you met at the wrong time.

272
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,710
You know what?

273
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,250
The light

274
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,580
released by the fixed stars we see

275
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,260
is actually hundreds of millions of light years from us.

276
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,560
If we send them messages

277
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,530
and tell them our love for them,

278
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,550
when they accept the messages and reply,

279
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,940
we will already be floating

280
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,510
to an unknown planet.

281
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,740
But it doesn't mean

282
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,820
we've never loved each other.

283
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,690
This love

284
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,770
is not meaningless.

285
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,650
[Monster Vintage]

286
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,370
Are you sure we don't need to wake him up?

287
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,290
Not necessarily.

288
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,740
Let's go.

289
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,900
I knew you don't belong on the Earth.

290
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,930
You've made contacts with an alien so soon.

291
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,960
You alien cat.

292
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,170
Don't bully Bean Bun.

293
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,550
You're awake.

294
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,530
The second squad of Monster Vintage

295
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,180
has set off.

296
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,580
The first squad

297
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,320
will set off immediately.

298
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,690
Where are we going?

299
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,810
Don't you want to find your fiancee?

300
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,940
I want to find her.

301
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,000
We must find her.

302
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,170
Where?

303
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,890
The medical university.

304
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:46,980
Let's go.

305
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,740
Okay.

306
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,700
How is

307
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,460
your allergy?

308
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,100
It's getting better.

309
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,190
I didn't sneeze much.

310
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,280
You might recover completely this time.

311
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,390
Really?

312
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,250
That's great.

313
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,130
Can we really find her

314
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,850
like this?

315
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,200
Don't you think it all depends on luck?

316
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,580
We only know that Professor Jiang and Li Yun

317
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,130
were on their way to the orphanage.

318
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,370
She might not be there.

319
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,770
But it's possible.

320
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,330
Professor Peng said

321
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,460
the car was full of documents and books.

322
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,830
♫Making noise alone and messing around alone. It's also good to be alone♫

323
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,690
♫Then let imagination control all my confusion♫

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:21,850

341
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,329
Hello?

342
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,040
Hello?

343
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,150
Can you hear me?

344
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,420
Hello?

345
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,880
There's no signal here.

346
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,370
What should we do now?

347
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,540
Robin's team

348
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,210
is on its way to Professor Jiang's grave.

349
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,100
Are we going too?

350
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,130
I think there should be another place

351
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,980
where we can go.

352
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,740
Okay.

353
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,810
Be careful.

354
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,860
This is Li Yun

355
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,540
and Professor Jiang who paid for her education.

356
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,040
Miss Li Yun.

357
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,820
I'm an intern lawyer of Junhao Law Firm.

358
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,500
My name is Sui Yi.

359
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,860
We've been looking for you.

360
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,620
Why?

361
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,180
Is it because of Wang Wenxin?

362
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,060
Now you even need a lawyer to break up?

363
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,780
It's not because of Mr. Wang.

364
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,420
It's because of an artist named Dong Li.

365
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,550
He left an art piece for you.

366
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,760
I don't know this Dong Li.

367
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,350
Dong Li is Li Zhe.

368
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,750
Li Zhe?

369
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,360
He can give me anything himself.

370
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,460
He's dead.

371
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,900
My client

372
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,310
wants to buy this art piece.

373
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,930
So I want to ask about

374
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,110
your opinion.

375
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,660
He died?

376
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,660
And he left me an art piece?

377
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,390
I don't want it.

378
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,030
That was his final work.

379
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,510
Don't you want to know what it is?

380
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,150
I don't want to know.

381
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,050
It's all in the past.

382
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,130
Time has passed,

383
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,820
but you didn't let it go.

384
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,330
Li Zhe and I did have a relationship.

385
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,850
But it's all in the past.

386
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,910
I've let it go.

387
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,230
If you have let it go,

388
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,300
why can't you accept Wang Wenxin?

389
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,890
I've let it go.

390
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
I've been trying so hard to live my life.

391
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,830
Why did you come to bother me?

392
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,220
You and your friends...

393
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,780
I don't know who sent you here

394
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,270
or what purpose you have,

395
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,580
please don't

396
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,850
appear in front of me again.

397
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,980
I think your teacher

398
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,520
doesn't want to see you like this.

399
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,160
You know nothing.

400
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,470
If your beloved teacher

401
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,010
died in front of you,

402
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,300
you studied medicine for six years,

403
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,960
but you couldn't do anything.

404
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,020
Have you ever experienced this helplessness?

405
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,920
Her blood came out of her mouth.

406
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,860
I could only feel her hands

407
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,540
getting cold gradually

408
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,640
and her body getting stiff gradually.

409
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,800
Have you ever experienced this fear?

410
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,030
You have never felt

411
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,290
the humility and despair

412
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,930
brought by the death of your loved one in front of you

413
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,130
because you could

414
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,030
do nothing about it,

415
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,120
so don't tear off others' scars easily.

416
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,930
I saw with my own eyes...

417
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,090
I saw

418
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,660
my mother died in front of me with my own eyes.

419
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,720
Chufeng.

420
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,770
Brother.

421
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,930
Help us!

422
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,350
You can go take a look

423
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,680
before making up your mind.

424
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,050
If you really want to say goodbye to the past,

425
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,440
you should go.

426
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,180
Okay.

427
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,710
We're going back now.

428
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,730
How's it going?

429
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,140
Did you find Olive?

430
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,820
Yes.

431
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,030
Where is she?

432
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,110
I'll pick her up.

433
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,260
Before I take you there,

434
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,430
I have something to tell you.

435
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,700
What's wrong?

436
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,650
Nothing.

437
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,560
Should we go?

438
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,620
Okay.

439
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:46,800
This is it.

440
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,930
This is it.

441
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,880
You must hold me tight.

442
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,710
Don't panic. Ride forward.

443
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,460
You can do it.

444
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,360
I...

445
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,930
My hand.

446
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,830
Sorry.

447
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,100
So ugly.

448
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,260
No.

449
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,110
Don't worry.

450
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,150
You're still the prettiest of us.

451
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,570
You're lying.

452
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,050
How am I not ugly when I look like this?

453
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,070
I'm disfigured.

454
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,770
Someone who is disfigured has scars on the face.

455
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,060
So you are not disfigured.

456
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,690
I don't care.

457
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,670
I am disfigured.

458
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,660
I'm not pretty anymore.

459
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,340
A fish bone?

460
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,370
That's right.

461
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,280
Look.

462
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,530
Isn't it amazing?

463
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,660
So vivid.

464
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,500
I'm a born artist.

465
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,730
If you really want to say goodbye to the past,

466
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,070
you should go.

467
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,980
You found her?

468
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:15,860
Yes.

469
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,190
But I'm not sure

470
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,020
whether she'll show up today.

471
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,020
Since it

472
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,780
has gone this far,

473
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,860
let's continue

474
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,980
based on your thoughts.

475
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,650
No matter what the result is,

476
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,500
you have to be prepared.

477
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,900
It's good to have someone to buy it.

478
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,180
Don't think I don't know

479
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,470
what you did back then.

480
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,830
You just want to make money.

481
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,840
What's wrong with making money?

482
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
I'm saving our company.

483
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
Everything will be fine

484
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
after I sell all of these collectibles in the art museum.

485
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,500
There is nothing wrong with making money.

486
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,860
But you are selfish.

487
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,170
No matter how many hardships your father endured,

488
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,180
he never owed his employees

489
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,610
a penny.

490
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,580
Resorting to a makeshift solution

491
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,560
instead of solving operational issues

492
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,800
can never solve the problems fundamentally.

493
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,730
Do you think I don't know

494
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,450
what my father did

495
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,470
with those artists including Dong Li?

496
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,380
It's all about tricks

497
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,220
of packaging.

498
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,710
Shut up!

499
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,750
Don't slander your father.

500
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,860
Who are you to tell me this?

501
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,010
Don't think I'll be fooled

502
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,910
like them.

503
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,020
What you said about Dong Li's lover

504
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,630
was all fabricated by you.

505
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,520
Because you can't prove it.

506
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:32,860
You just...

507
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,330
Curator.

508
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,180
Director.

509
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,920
Will she be here?

510
