Slow down.

6
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,940
The leading man is so handsome.

7
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,180
So cool.

8
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,060
Where did you go?

9
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,250
Binbin.

10
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,660
Why didn't you tell me you were here already?

11
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,520
It's all your fault.

12
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,300
Fine, it's my fault.

13
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,460
Son,

14
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,260
we were stuck in a traffic jam

15
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,090
after the movie.

16
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,810
Your mother was rushing me.

17
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,990
I got anxious

18
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,020
and drove the wrong way.

19
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,590
Which movie did you watch?

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,140
Was it good?

21
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,030
Not as good as my son.

22
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,329
Thank you.

23
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,579
I'm hungry.

24
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,000
Make us something to eat.

25
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,140
How about two bowls of noodles?

26
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,579
By the way,

27
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,100
Don't forget to cook some boiled eggs for us.

28
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,680
Roger that.

29
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,420
Did you skip dinner?

30
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,490
No.

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,260
But I got hungry after the movie.

32
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
And we can eat together.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:34,950
Okay.

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,600
What do you think? Are these flowers beautiful?

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,610
Not bad at all.

36
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,420
It must be Uncle Lu who picked this.

37
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,680
Your taste is not as good.

38
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,870
How is your blind date going this month?

39
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,850
Anyone you like?

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,340
They don't like me.

41
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,960
Nonsense.

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,930
My son is so outstanding.

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,390
I see.

44
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,480
It's because

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,390
you haven't experienced

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,140
the so-called love at first sight.

47
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,030
Right?

48
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,770
It's much harder than certification.

49
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,150
Love at first sight is not that easy.

50
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,890
You have to keep meeting people,

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,830
so you can expand your choices.

52
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,070
And then,

53
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,020
there will be more chances of love at first sight.

54
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,180
Do you understand?

55
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,340
I just don't get it.

56
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,480
There are six billion people in the world,

57
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,090
but you can't find someone you like.

58
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,060
How old would I be

59
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,260
if I met all six billion people?

60
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,770
What are you doing?

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,630
Just eat your food.

62
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,480
You're always in a hurry.

63
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,550
Can't you stay a few more days?

64
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,659
I have work tomorrow.

65
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,940
I need to go back and get ready.

66
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,060
Binbin, how about

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,730
When you're free,

68
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,460
ask your brother to come back from school

69
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,070
and find a restaurant you like.

70
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,860
We'll go and have a reunion dinner.

71
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,330
Yes, we should.

72
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,080
Okay.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,470
By the way,

74
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,800
It's a small gift for you.

75
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,780
Wear it.

76
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,110
For me?

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,800
It's so beautiful.

78
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:23,780
Isn't it pretty?

79
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,890
Yes. Yes.

80
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,900
Put it on me.

81
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,460
Okay.

82
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,050
Beautiful.

83
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,960
I'm heading out.

84
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,590
Okay.

85
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,390
Bye.

86
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,080
Bye.

87
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,140
See you.

88
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
Be careful on your way home.

89
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,700
Visit us more often.

90
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,580
Okay.

91
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,580
Let's go back.

92
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,460
♫And will they line the streets tonight?♫

93
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,730
♫Singing and bathing in new starlight♫

94
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,740
♫While I'm sitting at the side♫

95
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,810
♫Are we too young to understand?♫

96
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,840
♫To share, to ask, or raise a hand?♫

97
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,990
♫Looking back, we wish we had♫

98
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,250
He is so hansome.

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,870
Is he really into…

100
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,700
I think...

101
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,930
I think Robin likes He Chufeng.

102
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,540
It is possible.

103
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
Like you said,

104
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,180
he went on 78 blind dates.

105
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,440
None of them went well.

106
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,630
And he's always in the antique shop,

107
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,320
hanging out with He Chufeng.

108
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,330
No.

109
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,100
That doesn't mean they are a...

110
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,840
No, I don't think so.

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,740
It's very possible.

112
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,000
Look.

113
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,110
They went to the same high school.

114
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,690
And after such a long time,

115
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,190
both of them are still single.

116
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,100
Can you believe this?

117
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,940
No.

118
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,000
But Robin said

119
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,570
he believes in love at first sight.

120
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
He won't start dating

121
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,540
unless he has feelings for someone.

122
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,920
So

123
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,040
Robin

124
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,690
has never met someone he has feelings for.

125
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,860
Because that He Chufeng

126
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,230
is by his side.

127
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,340
It's impossible. Impossible.

128
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,140
Even they're close,

129
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,380
I still think he is straight.

130
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,340
How about

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,400
we examine this together.

132
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,660
You live in their house.

133
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,550
From your perspective,

134
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,130
how do their daily lives

135
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
look like?

136
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,050
Daily lives…

137
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,770
I'd like to have sunny side egg in my toast.

138
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,220
Take it or leave it.

139
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,220
Be happy that you have something to eat.

140
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,820
Since you've been cooking,

141
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,049
why not do it perfecctly?

142
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,260
Beauty is in perfection. Do you know that?

143
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,330
I made the toast.

144
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,880
So they were made my way.

145
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,020
Fine.

146
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,340
Chufeng. Oh, Chufeng!

147
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,510
He Chufeng.

148
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,010
What do you want?

149
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,040
We're out of toilet paper.

150
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,500
Should we buy some to stock up?

151
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,360
Just order some online.

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,260
But I don't know which one to choose. Buy 3 get 1 free,

153
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,600
or buy 5 get 15% off?

154
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,700
Use your calculator.

155
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,940
But there is two plies,

156
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,740
and three plies.

157
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,220
Leave me alone.

158
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,140
Chufeng. Oh, Chufeng!

159
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,740
He Chufeng.

160
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,700
Stop yelling.

161
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,110
He Chufeng.

162
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,820
Can you help, please?

163
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:19,850
Whatever.

164
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,020
I'm gonna ask now.

165
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,050
Can I ask you a question?

166
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,810
Do you like boys or girls?

167
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,730
What kind of question is thia?

168
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,410
Does it mean she like me, too?

169
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,420
She has even thought about our future child?

170
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,090
I...

171
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,710
I like boys and girls.

172
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,220
Sui Yi, you need to understand.

173
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
We're in a new era now.

174
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
What he said means

175
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,100
he is a open-minded person.

176
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,520
You still have a fifty-fifty chance of dating him.

177
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,440
Forget it.

178
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,140
You can't compete with Robin.

179
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,630
Let's just quit.

180
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,150
Well,

181
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,980
do you like boys or girls?

182
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,110
I like boys.

183
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,040
I see.

184
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
Just ask him directly.

185
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,460
And I'll be done with this.

186
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,710
Do you like Robin?

187
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,860
What

188
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,420
did you say?

189
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,670
I said

190
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,510
do you like Robin?

191
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,940
So when you asked me if I like boys or girls,

192
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,700
you meant

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,210
if I like men or women?

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,450
Yes.

195
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,270
I like women.

196
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,060
But you just said

197
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,220
you like boys and girls.

198
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,250
Then tell me

199
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,700
what made you ask a question like this?

200
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,690
Because you and Robin are very close.

201
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,040
And every time

202
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,700
I ask something about Robin,

203
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,720
you'll get jealous.

204
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,650
And it's weird that both of you are single

205
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,330
and not dating anyone.

206
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,970
There are 240 million single person in the country.

207
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,420
And you're not dating anyone.

208
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,940
I never thought you were weird.

209
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,050
I'm only suspecting.

210
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,810
I'm relieved now.

211
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,700
So do you like men or women?

212
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,440
I like boys.

213
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,010
Men or women?

214
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,270
Men.

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,640
Then...

216
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,870
Is Robin your type?

217
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,520
I told you.

218
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,480
I don't like him.

219
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,920
And he will never like me.

220
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,460
Well…

221
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,860
Am I your type?

222
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,640
I'm home.

223
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,130
What are you doing?

224
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,280
Watching a movie.

225
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,210
I've seen this.

226
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:45,850
Pick another one.

227
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,210
I...

228
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,700
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

229
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,020
What's going on with you two?

230
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,620
Gosh.

231
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,140
Where did you go tonight?

232
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,500
I went home.

233
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,040
Would you like a drink?

234
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,980
Sure.

235
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,290
Did you see your little brother at home?

236
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,450
He's at school.

237
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,590
What about your mother and him?

238
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,910
They are quite happy recently.

239
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,740
He Chufeng.

240
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,860
what would you do

241
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,780
if were not not a locksmith?

242
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,090
I might become an art teacher.

243
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,200
An art teacher?

244
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:14,790
Why?

245
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,280
When I was young, I taught Chunian how to draw.

246
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,630
I felt very accomplished.

247
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,290
Well, then

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,380
I really should call you Mr.He.

249
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,740
What about you?

250
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:27,860
I...

251
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,960
what would you do

252
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:29,890
if you were not an appraiser?

253
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,700
I would inherit my stepfather's business,

254
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,720
and become one of the rich second-generation.

255
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,970
Be a rich man with good taste.

256
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,860
You can inherit it now.

257
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,180
Well, never mind.

258
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,650
My little brother can inherit it.

259
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,620
Being a freelancer appraiser suits me better.

260
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,550
You should go home more often.

261
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,060
I was sitting there

262
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,660
and I saw her very happy.

263
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,980
I genuinely felt happy for her.

264
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:11,850
But I

265
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
can't blend in, no matter what.

266
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,500
It's as if I'm shield from their world.

267
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,370
I always try to make her happy.

268
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,190
I'll do whatever

269
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,300
she asks me to do.

270
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,750
But I'm not happy.

271
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,860
It's like an invisible crack

272
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,820
on an egg.

273
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,900
No one can see that crack.

274
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,230
But I know

275
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,860
it's always there.

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,930

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,260
♫'Cause I found you♫

343
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,800
♫'Cause I found you♫

344
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:02,770
Here.

345
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,940
How is it?

346
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,480
Does it taste better?

347
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,300
Sweet.

348
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,310
Here. Wipe your mouth for you.

349
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,540
Mei.

350
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:18,820
Mei.

351
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,700
What are you going to do with this house?

352
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,460
Have you made up your mind?

353
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,430
Are you going to sell it or not?

354
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,370
We've told you.

355
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,940
Not gonna sell it.

356
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,420
Xingyu.

357
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,860
Isn't it good to live with family?

358
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,660
You know

359
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,620
what's going on in our family.

360
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,700
You borrowed 32 thousand from me.

361
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,260
And I'm still in debt.

362
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,220
I gave you the money I borrowed,

363
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,700
for your treatment, didn't I?

364
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,290
Fine.

365
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,420
We're family.

366
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,670
I can cut you some slack.

367
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,460
But don't you think it's time

368
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,780
to pay my money back?

369
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,180
I'm telling you.

370
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,950
You must sell the house.

371
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,700
Do you hear me?

372
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,490
Stop lying.

373
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,500
You just want to take our house, don't you?

374
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,180
You are robbers! Criminals!

375
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,060
Liu Xingyu, shut your mouth!

376
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,580
He is your uncle.

377
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,020
Mom.

378
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,420
Can't you see?

379
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,490
How long do you want to be bullied by them?

380
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,860
Bully?

381
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,100
If I bully you,

382
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,140
you would have gone with your father, Liu.

383
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,290
Even if my last name is Liu,

384
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,480
this house is not yours.

385
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,690
You...

386
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,430
Hello.

387
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,640
Your name, please?

388
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,380
Hello, Mr. Jin.

389
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,050
I'm Sui Yi, a trainee solicitor from Junhao Law Firm.

390
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,310
I'm Mr. Jin's butler.

391
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,590
What can I do for you, Miss Sui?

392
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,600
Is Mr. Jin here?

393
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,980
I'm here to return

394
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,740
the gift Mr. Jin gave me last time.

395
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,820
If he is home,

396
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,460
I would like to thank him

397
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,070
in person.

398
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,940
I'm sorry, Miss Sui.

399
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,250
Mr. Jin is not at home right now.

400
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,200
Just leave the gift at the door.

401
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,700
I'll let Mr. Jin know.

402
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,910
Put it at the door.

403
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,670
Is that really okay?

404
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,410
Then I'll leave it there.

405
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,140
Please send my thanks

406
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,420
to Mr. Jin.

407
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,890
It's finally done.

408
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,350
[Monster Vintage]

409
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,380
Are you looking for Mr. He again?

410
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,440
I'm not here for him this time.

411
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,870
Who are you looking for?

412
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,740
Counselor Sui,

413
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,610
I came here to see you this time.

414
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,060
Property certificate.

415
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,020
Kid,

416
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,140
you shouldn't steal this.

417
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,270
Where did you get it?

418
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,730
This is ours.

419
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,060
Yours?

420
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,180
Look.

421
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,530
Who is Liu Liping?

422
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,150
She's my grandma.

423
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,450
I want to sue my uncle.

424
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,700
You're overthinking.

425
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,450
She came to see Sui Yi,

426
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,390
not you.

427
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,690
Didn't she ask you to open the lock a few days ago?

428
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,200
Why did she change her mind today?

429
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,100
Will she come to see me later?

430
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,700
We set a very high bar for our profession.

431
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,210
People can't just come to learn because they want to.

432
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,270
How should I reject her then?

433
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,970
You're overthinking.

434
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,380
She brought the property certificate and is going to sue her uncle.

435
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,520
She must feel deeply wronged.

436
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,830
I hope she wasn't abused by someone.

437
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,140
She was treated badly at the police station last time.

438
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,200
Should we go back early?

439
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,750
Why did you ask me to shop groceries with you?

440
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,090
I wanted to join the audience

441
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,180
and listen to the gossip.

442
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,620
What are you going to do?

443
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,730
They can't sell this house.

444
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,880
You're a lawyer.

445
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,310
You can sue them, right?

446
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,430
Did your grandmother own other properties

447
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,880
other than this house?

448
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,060
My grandma was sick.

449
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,500
All her money was gone.

450
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,420
This house is the only thing left by her.

451
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,890
If that's the case,

452
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,460
the problem will be very simple.

453
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,700
First of all, your grandmother's name

454
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,300
is the only name on the property certificate.

455
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,660
Legally speaking,

456
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,580
this house belongs to your grandma.

457
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,720
Second,

458
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,780
your grandma has passed away.

459
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,500
If she didn't make a will

460
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,490
to specify the matter,

461
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
this house should be given

462
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,060
to the first person in line to inherit.

463
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,840
That means your mom and uncle

464
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,610
co-own the house.

465
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,390
Each of them owns half of it.

466
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,780
But they didn't take care of my grandma.

467
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,520
Why should they co-own the house?

468
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,940
Grandma told me

469
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,700
this house

470
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,100
belongs to me and my mom.

471
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,780
Did your grandma make a will?

472
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,980
A notarized one.

473
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,750
Do you have that kind of will?

474
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,620
No.

475
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,140
The kind you said is a verbal will.

476
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,900
This kind will

477
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,930
must be made during an emergency.

478
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,400
What kind of situation was it

479
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,500
when your grandma told you that?

480
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,860
My grandma was just discharged from the hospital.

481
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,040
Uncle didn't come.

482
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
so she was very sad.

483
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,490
She told me about her will that night.

484
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,060
Was anyone else there

485
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,780
besides you?

486
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,460
No.

487
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,470
Only I was there.

488
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:21,920
Big Force,

489
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,630
although it is hard to accept,

490
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,450
I have to tell you

491
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,980
what your grandma said

492
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,940
is legally an invalid will.

493
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,570
Shouldn't the law protect us?

494
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,330
Everyone is equal in front of the law.

495
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,900
The law must protect you

496
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,450
and your mother's rights.

497
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,180
It also must protect your uncle's rights.

498
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,580
But he never took care of my grandmother.

499
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,150
Why should the law protect someone like him?

500
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,450
The law protects all human's rights,

501
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,100
no matter they're good or bad people.

502
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,500
The law is fair.

503
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,820
So based on all the information

504
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,870
you provided,

505
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,730
you can't sue your uncle.

506
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,000
So… so

507
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,060
there's nothing we can do

508
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,180
about the house?

509
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,380
Unfortunately,

510
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,300
your mother and uncle

511
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,980
should be the decision makers for the house.

512
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,430
Alright. Alright.

513
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,300
Are we really not going back early?

514
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,030
There's no hurry.

515
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,330
He Chufeng,

516
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,470
seriously, based on

517
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,920
my recent observations on you,

518
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,110
I think you've changed.

519
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,020
What do you want?

520
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,740
Help yourself.

521
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,430
You've really changed.

522
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,800
You watched a movie with Sui Yi?

523
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,970
Yes, why?

524
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,140
I can't watch a movie?

525
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,740
The first time you've watched a movie together, you did it at home.

526
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,190
Impressive.

527
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,660
We have a TV at home.

528
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,340
Why do we need to go to the movies?

529
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,540
Do you want me to buy popcorn for you guys?

530
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,050
No.

531
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,410
He Chufeng.

532
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:04,750
No way.

533
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,960
If you and Sui Yi are together,

534
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,500
what would I do?

535
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,740
I'll become a third wheel.

536
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,880
If you two are together for real,

537
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,710
I'll be alone.

538
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,410
You're always alone.

539
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,700
Did you find

540
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,340
that Sui Yi is actually very innocent.

541
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,180
Am I not innocent?

542
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,580
You're not innocent at all.

543
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,340
Do you really not need my help?

544
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,700
I'm very experienced.

545
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
What did you tell her?

546
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,720
That house

547
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,990
belongs to her mother and her uncle.

548
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,720
She can't sue her uncle.

549
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,450
Besides,

550
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,210
even if her uncle wants to sell the house,

551
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,350
it has nothing to do with her.

552
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,780
So she is very upset right now.

553
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,940
She needs to be hydrated.

554
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,390
Should I

555
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,120
not be so straightforward?

556
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,730
She is still a kid.

557
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,460
Children have the right to know the truth.

558
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,130
Get up. The ground is cold.

559
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,770
Thank you.

560
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:12,740
You're welcome.

561
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,890
Christmas is aroud the corner.

562
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,780
Do you think it will snow this year?

563
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,900
No.

564
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,520
It has never snowed here.

565
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,180
And the weather is so weird this year.

566
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
You can never know

567
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,000
what will happen in the future.

568
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,770
That is the joy of life.

569
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,760
Why do you call yourself Big Force?

570
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,060
Are you very strong?

571
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,730
Your original name

572
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,860
is actually nice.

573
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,270
I don't like that name.

574
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,750
So childish.

575
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,170
Childish?

576
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,700
Why?

577
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,970
This name

578
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,680
was given by someone I really hate.

579
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,090
It's a stupid name too.

580
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,330
Liu Xingyu. Liu Xingyu.

581
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,140
It sounds like a girl’s name.

582
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,080
You are a girl actually.

583
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,040
What happened to your face?

584
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,520
Did you get hurt?

585
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:08,780
I was bullied.

586
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,420
I was bullied in high school too.

587
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,090
Do boys get bullied too?

588
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,230
It has nothing to do with being a boy or a girl.

589
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,530
Did you punch them back then?

590
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,280
I did.

591
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,510
I punched back very hard.

592
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,260
No one would dare to bully me again.

593
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,780
So you just want to

594
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,700
look tough.

595
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,930
That's why you call yourself Big Force

596
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,650
and have your hair cut short. Right?

597
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,620
No, don't talk nonsense.

598
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,810
My name

599
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,080
was given by someone I hate as well.

600
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,810
What's wrong with your name?

601
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,090
My name is Luo Bin.

602
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,700
And then, for a while

603
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,580
I went by Robin seriously.

604
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,530
I wanted to completely keep away from my life.

605
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,720
I thought about it later. I find it kind of ridiculous.

606
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,390
He was a poor guy.

607
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,970
And it was just a name

608
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,110
no matter how I name myself.

609
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,350
Robin is actually Luo Bin, isn't it?

610
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,520
It certainly is.

611
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,590
But I was so childish back then.

612
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,280
Come.

613
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,300
Come in and have a seat.

614
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,800
- Have a seat. - Thank you.

615
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,500
Make yourself at home when you're here.

616
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,370
Here, try the ribs.

617
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,990
Thank you.

618
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,750
By the way,

619
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,730
does a locksmith have to know how to cook?

620
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,930
Yes.

621
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,060
That's right.

622
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,230
This is an essential skill.

623
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,130
Okay.

624
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,300
They're just kidding.

625
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,000
Don't take it seriously.

626
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,010
But it's hard to be a locksmith.

627
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,380
You need to learn a lot.

628
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,540
Didn't you see that Mr. He's studio

629
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,400
is filled with books

630
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,730
and all kinds of strange tools?

631
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,380
Can I go in there to look?

632
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,280
Why do you want to learn lock picking?

633
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,180
Does a locksmith make good money?

634
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,500
I can only support myself.

635
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,450
I think the money you make from one job

636
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,140
is enough for our living expenses for days.

637
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,180
He opened a special lock that day.

638
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,480
It requires techniques.

639
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,070
Big Force,

640
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,150
do you want to learn lock picking to make money?

641
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,100
Why not?

642
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,480
I've told you

643
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,530
that I'm not gonna teach you

644
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,990
when your intention is not pure.

645
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,540
Why did you learn how to open locks?

646
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,380
Was your intention pure?

647
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,040
There are many ways to make money in this world.

648
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,330
You can work part-time,

649
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,310
or work full-time.

650
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,760
They're decent ways

651
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,540
to make money.

652
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,159
But if you want to learn lock picking

653
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,330
to make quick money,

654
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,420
because you saw me

655
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,650
opened someone's safe box.

656
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:13,889
A lot of money was inside.

657
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,650
So you were intrigued.

658
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,080
Nonsense. I didn't.

659
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,530
Every day, you pretended to go to school, wearing the uniform.

660
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,820
But actually, you go out

661
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
to take free napkins,

662
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,699
straws, sugar,

663
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,429
and bring them home, don't you?

664
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,900
Those things are free.

665
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:35,909
I didn't steal or rob.

666
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,030
You can just take a bunch of those things

667
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,020
because they're free?

668
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,659
You said you did it for your mother.

669
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,380
But does she know?

670
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,550
Will she be sad if she knows?

671
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,650
You have no idea what kind of life

672
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,030
my mom is living.

673
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,270
She lies in bed every day.

674
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,810
No one cares whether we're alive or not.

675
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,040
Why?

676
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,510
No one has an easy life.

677
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
It's all in your head.

678
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,640
You're so naive.

679
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,220
It's naive of you to take the property certificate and sue your uncle.

680
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,010
It's naive of you not knowing about the invalid will.

681
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,100
It is also naive of you

682
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,090
to stole things to get my attention.

683
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,320
You keep saying you want to protect your mother.

684
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,390
How can you protect her?

685
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,340
By being ignorant?

686
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,850
Then what should I do?

687
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,220
You need to get strong first

688
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,890
to protect others.

689
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,090
I'm heading out.

690
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:26,940
Thank you.

691
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,090
Take out the tissues

692
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,920
in your bag before you leave.

693
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,720
Big Force.

694
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,530
Don't look for her.

695
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,170
What if something happens to her?

696
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,770
If she really loves her mother

697
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,210
as she said,

698
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,820
she will definitely go home.

699
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,330
Are you okay?

700
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,190
- Does it hurt? - I’m fine.

701
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,890
Are you Big Force?

702
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,820
How do you know who I am?

703
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,230
That's not your concern.

704
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,530
I heard that

705
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,250
you want to learn lock picking from He Chufeng.

706
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,780
She left this.

707
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,910
Do you think your words

708
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,950
might be too harsh?

709
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,400
I'm still worried about her emotions.

710
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,810
Emotions are the most useless things.

711
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,180
You can comfort her for a moment.

712
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,870
But can you do that for good?

713
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,350
Comforting her is just an act of avoidance.

714
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,870
But we could say

715
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,100
those things in a mild way.

716
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,970
Problems and conflicts

717
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,030
won't disappear because of a few words.

718
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,200
I want to help her

719
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,770
as much as you do.

720
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,170
You can see that

721
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,820
she and her mother do need help.

722
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,610
That's why we should tell her the truth

723
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,490
and the facts.

724
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,600
Yes.

725
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,680
You're right.

726
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,520
That is true.

727
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,490
But she's only a teenager.

728
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,710
We can talk to her

729
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,750
in another way.

730
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,810
I think what you said was too cruel.

731
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,810
We need to protect her.

732
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,930
When I was a teenager,

733
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,550
I needed someone to tell me

734
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,650
how much I would pay

735
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,200
for the mistakes I made.

736
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,530
I didn't need the so-called protection.

737

[Monster Notebook]

738
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,730
Thanks to you,

739
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,000
I bought two.

740
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,650
You're welcome.

741
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,550
We got something too.

742
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,380
Really, listen to me.

743
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:46,990
Jia Xiaoguo,

744
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,090
you look great wearing this color.

745
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,520
You can wear it

746
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,210
when you're not on duty.

747
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,000
I just want to know how long

748
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,050
can I keep a lipstick before it expires?

749
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,510
About 3 years.

750
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,340
Three years?

751
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,060
I can't even use up one in 5 years.

752
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,000
Sui Yi,

753
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,000
have you updated my data?

754
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,300
What data?

755
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,790
Did you forget about it?

756
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,270
Progress of Robin's battle.

757
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,570
I thought you didn't mean it.

758
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,740
I'm serious, okay?

759
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,540
I purposefully brought

760
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,450
my treasury book

761
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,430
for you to appreciate.

762
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,660
Alright, kneel down.

763
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,440
You can really write a thesis about it.

764
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,260
Yuan,

765
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,620
do you know about youth research?

766
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,070
What is youth research?

767
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,060
It is

768
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,630
a multidisciplinary research

769
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,880
focuses on youth.

770
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,080
I think you can build

771
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,330
a multidisciplinary research

772
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,490
that focuses on handsome men.

773
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,940
Your research can include anthropology, sociology,

774
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,120
psychology and philosophy.

775
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,200
Yeah. Yeah.

776
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,390
I might consider it.

777
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,180
Maybe there will be a chance

778
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,280
of building that research in future.

779
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,500
If it's possible,

780
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,830
I can make an effort

781
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,950
and admit you two as my first students.

782
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,580
I think I will fail the courses

783
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,370
and have a three-year delayed graduation.

784
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,070
I don't think I can even get into that program.

785
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,810
Oh. no.

786
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,140
Are you really not interested

787
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,480
in boys at all?

788
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,040
I mean sweet and nice boys.

789
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,310
Sweet and nice.

790
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,380
The adjectives

791
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,660
sounds a bit strange.

792
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,060
Seriously, you haven't liked

793
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,600
any guy before?

794
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,630
Right now,

795
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,920
I just want to complete my internship,

796
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,430
get my lawyer's license,

797
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,690
and become a real lawyer.

798
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,680
Not a trainee.

799
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,810
What about you?

800
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,480
I...

801
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,740
Now I just want to be a good cop.

802
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,500
No way.

803
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,630
We're cute girls.

804
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,030
What about you?

805
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,700
I… don't have a boy either.

806
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,220
Then why are you lecturing us?

807
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,730
I'm just concerned about you

808
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,730
and interested in your situations.

809
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,650
Actually you're just gossiping.

810
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,150
I'm not gossiping.

811
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,380
Sui Yi said

812
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,950
this is youth research.

813
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,420
No matter what you call it,

814
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,450
it is gossiping.
