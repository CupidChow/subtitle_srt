00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,270
I know

6
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,240
you won't be on the same boat with me.

7
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:42,830
Fine.

8
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,770
I'll let you

9
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,000
go to hell with me.

10
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,850
Mr. Jin.

11
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,900
Boss is here.

12
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,460
I'll go there later.

13
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,040
Come out.

14
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,590
Boss.

15
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,940
You want to see me?

16
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,860
Boss.

17
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,480
During my absence,

18
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,120
you had a lot of fun.

19
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,060
What fun did I have?

20
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,500
For the sake of your relationship

21
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,579
with my sister,

22
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,450
I took you into this business.

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,620
But I didn't ask you

24
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,320
to intefere with my business.

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,810
Xiuyi, let me explain.

26
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,829
I just

27
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,540
wanted to make more money for you.

28
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:01,760
I...

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,390
You bought works from Qianhe Gallery

30
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,940
and sold faked ones

31
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:08,980
at twice the price.

32
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,220
Jin, tell me.

33
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,640
That's not all, right?

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,200
But Xiuyi,

35
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,690
I have no selfish motive.

36
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,210
I promise you.

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,530
I swear.

38
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,780
So,

39
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,070
you made such a situation for me,

40
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,730
such a mess,

41
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,340
right?

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,600
No.

43
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,380
I...

44
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,180
I'll clean up

45
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
this mess right away.

46
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,870
I'll clean it up for you.

47
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,660
I won't cause you any trouble, okay?

48
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,720
Jin.

49
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,860
This mess

50
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,570
is good.

51
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,530
Really?

52
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,690
Yes.

53
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,829
[If you call the police, he'll die.]

54
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,700
Mr. He.

55
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,120
You're here.

56
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,570
Where is Robin?

57
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,910
Calm down, Mr. He.

58
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,380
Your friend

59
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,490
is taken good care of by Mr. Jin.

60
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,060
Mr. He,

61
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,530
since you are here,

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,990
let's make a deal.

63
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,340
Cut the crap.

64
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,820
Where's Robin?

65
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,330
You want to save your friend?

66
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,200
Sure.

67
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,070
But I'm a businessman.

68
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,980
What do businessmen care about the most?

69
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,210
Profits.

70
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,380
Yes.

71
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,980
You don't care about that.

72
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,909
What do you care about?

73
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:01,900
Justice.

74
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,370
Friends.

75
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,260
Affection.

76
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,830
Don't you think these

77
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,420
are your weaknesses?

78
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,660
Where is Robin?

79
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,910
You want to find him.

80
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,980
Sure.

81
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,120
Two prerequisites.

82
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,300
First,

83
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,830
buy him back with money.

84
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,930
-Second... -I have no money.

85
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,280
You didn't listen to my second prerequisite.

86
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,310
I don't join hands with bad guys.

87
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,610
Bad guy?

88
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,620
Tell me what's good

89
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,370
and what's bad.

90
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,670
Why do you think the police need your help?

91
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,310
They're just watching you

92
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,900
in another way.

93
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,510
But you

94
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,850
are willing to work for them.

95
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,260
Why don't you join me,

96
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,100
join us?

97
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,090
I can help you

98
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,130
and your friends

99
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,750
make a lot of money.

100
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,560
This world is dirty.

101
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,120
The survival of the fittest

102
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,130
is always the rule.

103
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,560
Money

104
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,730
is the most important.

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
So is desire.

106
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,640
The cooperation between the strongest

107
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,280
is the only way out.

108
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,790
Some people have a lot of money

109
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
but forget the password.

110
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,220
Some people can pick many locks

111
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,770
but they don't have much money.

112
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,530
Move a few fingers

113
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,040
and you can have countless money.

114
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,780
What are you still thinking about?

115
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,090
I don't believe you haven't been moved.

116
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,340
I don't have time

117
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,960
to talk about your financial views and worldview.

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,260
Tell me.

119
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,380
Where is Robin?

120
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,600
Are you talking about brotherhood?

121
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,030
You remind me of

122
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,110
a good friend of mine.

123
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,870
A very good friend.

124
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,020
He committed suicide.

125
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,070
Do you know why?

126
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,170
That's your business.

127
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,340
It has nothing to do with me.

128
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,820
Your master

129
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,790
doesn't want you to be happy.

130
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,390
What should you do?

131
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,870
It's all

132
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,090
his idea

133
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,780
to ask your best friend

134
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,850
to come here.

135
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,020
I suddenly found it interesting.

136
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,400
I didn't want to get involved,

137
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,340
but I changed my mind.

138
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,660
Gu Nan

139
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,100
is so stupid

140
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,220
and worthless.

141
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,370
You're so interesting.

142
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,770
I should talk to you.

143
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,970
We are not the same kind.

144
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,040
There's nothing to talk about.

145
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,920
Not the same kind.

146
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,370
He is the illegitimate child.

147
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,470
He's an illegitimate child.

148
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,800
Just because I'm not the same kind,

149
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,970
so I don't have any chance?

150
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,420
So I don't have any chance?

I didn't call you.

Aren't you still here?

178
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,920
Do you have a clip

179

or a pin?

180

Stop talking.

183
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,030
Do you need a tool to pick the lock?

184
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,650
It's not difficult to pick.

185
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,310

and twist them together.

197
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,660
Theoretically, it's feasible.

198
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,750
If we can get out this time,

199
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,270
you can come back to the vintage store anytime you want.

you are a noble

As for me,

385
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,220

But don't forget

388
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,070
I gave you everything.

389
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,800
I also taught you your skills.

390
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,140
If I hadn't

391

found you in the garage,

392

you would still be fixing broken cars there.

393

If I knew

394
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,430
you would become like this,

395
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,860
I wouldn't have asked you to teach me.

396

If I had known,

397

I would rather live in darkness from the beginning.

I thought you really let it go.

401
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,680
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,590
It's all because of me.

403
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,890
I shouldn't have gone to you.

404
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,300
I shouldn't have followed you.

405
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,250
I brought you so much pain.

406
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,520
It was my choice

407
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,980
that kept torturing you.

Just let yourself go.
