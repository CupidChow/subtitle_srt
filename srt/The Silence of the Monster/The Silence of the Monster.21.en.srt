172
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,700
Every passer-by would ask

173
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,660
if you two are in a relationship.

174
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,670
You kept a high profile when you told others your relationship.

175
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,070
So be honest.

176
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,820
I said it first.

177
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,400
So what?

178
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,620
No.

179
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,920
I said it first.

180
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,620
Okay.

181
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,340
It's your turn.

182
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,470
I slipped.

183
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,290
You just slipped?

184
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,580
Aren't you going to be responsible for me?

185
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,030
What responsibility do you want me to take?

186
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,460
Why don't you slip too?

187
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,450
I'll catch you.

188
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,830
Have you forgotten

189
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,260
what you did to me?

190
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,180
Have you forgotten it?

191
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,540
I don't remember.

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,280
I lost my memory.

193
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,220
At first, you said the washing machine was broken.

194
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,420
Then I came to help you with the washing machine.

195
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,500
I threw the clothes in.

196
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,820
I pressed the timer and pressed the start button.

197
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,500
When I turned around, you stood on tiptoes

198
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,630
and kissed me on the cheek.

199
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,690
Then a burst of sunshine came in.

200
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,500
You became shy.

201
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,260
When you turned around,

202
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,740
you almost fell.

203
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,470
Then I caught you and stopped you from falling.

204
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,290
You have to be responsible for me.

205
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,100
Have you forgotten?

206
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,230
The clothes are still in the washing machine.

207
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,020
They should be finished washing.

208
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,800
I'll go and take a look.

209
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,780
Leave me alone.

210
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,660
You two can leave here together

211
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,220
immediately.

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,150
Excuse me.

213
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,060
Who can care about me?

214
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,230
What are you doing?

215
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,740
I'm going back to read.

216
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,940
Is what you said true?

217
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,610
What did I say?

218
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,580
Did you lose your memory?

219
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,890
It's true.

♫Making noise alone and messing around alone. It's also good to be alone♫

Warm it up before eating.

Eating takeout is bad for your health.

Take care.

Or do you have some other intentions?

Forget it. I'll do the dishes myself.

These are the keys to your rooms.

337
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,640
This room is this way.

338
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,690
This room is over there.

339
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,820
Okay, thank you.

340
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,660
It's nice to travel.

341
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,020
We can live together.

342
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,570
Don't we always live together?

343
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,020
It's different.

344
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,610
Do you want to live with Sui Yi?

345
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,130
You get up and go to bed at the same time.

346
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,380
It'll be more convenient.

347
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,040
No need.

348
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,700
It's also convenient for me to share a room with you.

349
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,830
Are you sure?

350
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,700
You don't have many opportunities to travel like this.

351
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,380
Yes.

352
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,770
I'll share a room with you.

353
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,020
Let me tell you.

354
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,980
When I come out,

355
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,330
I talk a lot.

356
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,900
When I sleep,

357
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,020
I talk to myself,

358
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,900
grind my teeth and sleepwalk.

359
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,700
Are you sure you want to share a room with me?

360
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,940
I can sleep well.

361
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,020
Fine.

362
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,520
I'll reluctantly share a room with you.

363
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,380
Thank you.

364
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,040
This room is so big.

365
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,340
The view is nice too.

366
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,380
This is great.

367
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,180
Let me try this sofa.

368
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,730
It's comfortable.

369
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,010
Gosh, it's so big.

370
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,040
Why don't we live in the forest room too?

371
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,810
There was only one forest room left.

372
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,640
And this one is half cheaper.

373
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,440
Fine.

374
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,970
Girls should live better.

375
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,100
Let's make do with it.

376
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,300
It's half cheaper.

377
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,830
I've prepared some travel tips.

378
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,250
Take a look.

379
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,630
It's 11 o'clock now.

380
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,860
Just as I planned.

381
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:23,970
We'll have lunch first

382
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,500
at a farm stay at noon.

383
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,890
I specially found a restaurant with the No. 1 ranking

384
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,880
on the Internet.

385
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,180
After lunch, around one o'clock,

386
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,380
we can go to...

387
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,700
Guess what we're going to do next.

388
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,910
You look like

389
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,500
a tour guide who wants to hit his KPI.

390
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,250
It's rare for me to travel.

391
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,660
Of course I have to plan carefully.

392
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,340
Let me tell you.

393
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,980
I've checked many travel notes

394
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,620
and travel tips.

395
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,710
I specially made an optimal plan.

396
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,380
But why do I feel

397
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,260
your plan is more tiring

398
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,690
than going to work?

399
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,770
What do you want to do?

400
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
Why are they still in the yard?

401
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,160
There were two fishes over there.

402
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,340
Why didn't I see anything?

403
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,790
I think they hid in there.

404
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,980
Look.

405
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,900
It's beautiful.

406
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,670
An has fair skin and a pretty face.

407
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,840
Doesn't An get tired of you

408
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,090
being clingy?

409
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,950
I'm not clingy.

410
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,530
I didn't get tired of you and Sui Yi.

411
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,340
Why?

412
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,350
Why should I be got tired of?

413
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,290
No, no, no.

414
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,100
You're good.

415
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,740
Did An sleep well last night?

416
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,720
Take good care of An for me.

417
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,810
What are you doing?

418
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,170
If you have any questions you want to ask An,

419
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,660
ask An yourself.

420
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,790
If you want to take care of her, take care of her yourself.

421
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,110
Don't bother Sui Yi.

422
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,380
I think Sui Yi and I

423
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,510
are twins.

424
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,130
That's not true.

425
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,460
Also,

426
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,780
keep your distance from Sui Yi.

427
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,540
From now on,

428
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,650
I won't talk to Sui Yi.

429
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,850
I'll only talk to An.

430
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,710
An is prettier than Sui Yi.

431
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,600
Sui Yi is prettier than An.

432
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,460
Childish.

433
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,390
Shallow.

434
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,690
One is so boring,

435
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,110
and the other is so noisy.

436
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,660
One pretends to be deep,

437
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,810
and the other likes to fuss.

438
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,240
He doesn't reply to my WeChat messages often.

439
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,540
You still hold a grudge?

440
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,140
He's always clingy.

441
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,130
I'm just worried about your safety.

442
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,580
An.

443
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,180
Do you really think I'm noisy?

444
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,770
Look at the photos I just took of you.

445
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,680
It's so beautiful.

446
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,210
Hello.

447
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,060
What would you like?

448
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,280
Is what you said true?

449
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,910
No.

450
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,370
Actually, you're quite good.

451
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,330
Okay.

452
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,890
Tell me why I'm good.

453
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,480
You're handsome.

454
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,980
Robin is not ugly.

455
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,380
You're smart.

456
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,770
He's not stupid.

457
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,070
You obey the law.

458
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,440
He didn't break the law.

459
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,120
But

460
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,320
you have a girlfriend named Sui Yi.

461
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,800
It seems that I have good taste.

462
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:45,980
Hello?

463
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,430
What's wrong?

464
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,930
I have something urgent to do about my work.

465
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,090
I need to reply to an email.

466
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,530
Sorry.

467
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,730
You can go play first.

468
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,450
I'll finish it soon.

469
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,460
I'll come to you when I finish it.

470
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,780
I'll go with you.

471
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,620
No need.

472
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,300
It's rare for you to travel.

473
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,890
Have fun.

474
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,260
I'll finish it soon.

475
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,820
Why are you back?

476
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,390
I couldn't find them.

477
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,590
You couldn't find them?

478
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,660
Should we call them?

479
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,400
Let them go.

480
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,330
Let me

481
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,580
stay here with you.

482
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,410
Okay.

483
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,640
♫The breeze is brushing my weary face♫

484
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,890
♫Looking at the stars, under the moonlight♫

485
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,940
Are you sure we should go this way?

486
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,060
Why do I feel that

487
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,460
we've walked this way several times?

488
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,670
♫Suddenly I have too many thoughts♫

489
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,900
I'm following GPS.

490
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,410
♫It's almost midnight♫

491
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,800
It can't be wrong.

492
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,470
Don't go that way.

493
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,330
There's no road.

494
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,020
♫I can't sleep at all♫

495
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,040
No.

496
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,380
There's no signal.

497
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,650
Which way should we go?

498
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:24,890
Scenic spot.

499
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,050
Where is the map of the scenic spot?

500
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,390
Right, the map.

501
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,060
Look at the map.

502
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,500
Map.

503
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:29,930
This way.

504
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,150
