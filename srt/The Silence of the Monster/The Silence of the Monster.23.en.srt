[Will you miss me after leaving?]

5
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,740
I'm free.

6
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,530
I don't have to care about others' feelings.

7
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,539
But now I feel tired being alone.

8
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,520
I don't know what's wrong with me.

9
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,530
I don't like myself being like this.

10
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,160
Cupid tied a knot in my heart.

11
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,660
And it's a knot

12
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,130
that I'm unable to untie.

13
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,250
I thought about countless results.

14
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,780
But I didn't expect this one.

15
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,050
I can't accept it.

16
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,510
I fell in love too fast

17
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,490
and I broke up too fast.

18
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,980
I didn't even have a chance to enjoy it.

19
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Now she's gone.

20
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,180
My love is still here,

21
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,140
left here alone with me.

22
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,980
Then call her.

23
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,940
No.

24
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,140
I can't call her.

25
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,010
An. Fang Qi.

26
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,730
She has a fiance.

27
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,010
She is Fang Qi,

28
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,360
not An.

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,690
I think she took my phone.

30
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,810
She just took my phone.

31
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,770
And it's a used phone.

32
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,430
Did she just want to get my phone?

33
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,300
I think she took more from me.

34
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,150
[I owe Robin a gift.]

35
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,360
He Chufeng.

36
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,270
How serious do you think

37
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,530
the breakup of a relationship is?

38
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,030
It looks like it's really serious.

39
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,970
I read in a book that

40
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,630
there are several stages to go through after someone broke up.

41
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,600
But the behavior varies from men to women

42
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,700
and from person to person.

43
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,060
Which stage do you think Robin is in?

44
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,770
What are the stages?

45
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,020
Having a heartbreak.

46
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,990
Trying to pull himself together.

47
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,050
Trying to make her stay.

48
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,850
Feeling relieved.

49
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,430
He's crazy

50
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,400
and depressed.

51
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,290
He should be in the first stage.

52
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,760
Have you ever broken up with someone?

53
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,700
I...

54
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,930
I don't think so.

55
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,020
What about you?

56
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,050
No.

57
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,100
Do you want to feel it now?

58
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,060
No.

59
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,340
I have something to tell you.

60
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,140
Go ahead.

61
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,500
Let's take this opportunity

62
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,710
to have a serious discussion.

63
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,170
Do you have any suggestions

64
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,020
for me after we're together?

65
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,409
We can talk about them

66
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,260
to avoid a possible breakup in the future.

67
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,980
We won't break up.

68
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,140
I don't want to break up with you either.

69
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,590
That's why we need to discuss seriously.

70
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,580
It helps us better communicate

71
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,370
with each other.

72
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,780
Come on, tell me.

73
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,620
Is there anything you are satisfied

74
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,500
and dissatisfied with me?

75
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,620
I'm satisfied with everything.

76
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,650
You're not objective.

77
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,870
You have to be objective.

78
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,660
Tell me. I won't be angry.

79
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,320
Really?

80
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,270
I won't.

81
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,420
Discussions are for better communication.

82
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:12,970
Tell me.

83
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,640
You have many virtues.

84
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,640
You are a neat person and you get up early.

85
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,220
You are hard-working.

86
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,380
These are all your virtues.

87
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,420
Enough.

88
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,870
I know these virtues.

89
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,750
Tell me my shortcomings.

90
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,510
Shortcomings?

91
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,740
You're a little careless in your daily life.

92
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,250
I think you are right.

93
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,260
Let me take a note.

94
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,330
And

95
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,030
you haven't finished reading any one

96
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,920
of the books I recommended to you.

97
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,330
I've read them.

98
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,730
It's just I'm busy.

99
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,650
And...

100
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,820
Are you done?

101
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,460
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

102
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,409
How come there are so many problems?

103
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,240
They are not problems at all.

104
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,200
These

105
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,220
are problems indeed.

106
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,240
I thought really hard before I realized these problems.

107
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,370
My dear roommates.

108
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,660
My cutest friends.

109
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,400
[The third day of breakup]

110
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,700
It's time for cleaning again.

111
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,080
He Chufeng.

112
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,220
Do you have any soiled clothes

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
that I can wash for you?

114
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,800
Sui Yi,

115
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,050
do you have any light bulbs to be replaced?

116
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,980
Or do you have anything to be fixed?

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,730
Leave them to me.

118
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,560
And

119
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,710
if your friends have anything to be appraised,

120
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,890
just come to me.

121
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,910
It's free.

122
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,780
Are you sure you don't have any soiled clothes?

123
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,310
The cuff is a little dirty.

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,790
I think it should be washed, what do you think?

125
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,630
Just wake up.

126
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,040
Don't touch me.

127
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,980
I'm sober.

128
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,260
Otherwise, other people will misunderstand.

129
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,820
Sui Yi.

130
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,620
Tell your boyfriend to behave himself.

131
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,700
I will.

132
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,220
Take it off.

133
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,630
Why?

134
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,260
Just take it off when he asks you to.

135
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,380
It's good to find something for him to do.

136
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,820
What does it have to do with me?

137
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,700
He wants to wash clothes for you.

138
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,520
Just let him wash.

139
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,730
In this special situation,

140
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
Robin's needs come first.

141
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,950
So what can I find for him to fix?

142
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,320
There is nothing wrong with the light bulbs.

143
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,930
I can loosen them first and ask him to fix them.

144
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,320
What are you doing?

145
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,230
Didn't you ask me to take it off?

146
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,890
He Chufeng.

147
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,580
You look like a neat person usually.

148
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,270
I didn't expect you have so many soiled clothes.

149
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,419
Yes.

150
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,860
I usually put them in the closet.

151
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,530
Robin.

152
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,039
These things don't work well.

153
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,059
Help me fix them.

154
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,510
Thank you.

155
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,550
Sui Yi,

156
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,390
you have so many things to be fixed.

157
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,260
But it's fine.

158
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,540
I'll fix them for you.

159
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,550
It looks like I'm really important in this house.

160
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,990
That's right, Robin.

161
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,380
What else do we need to clean?

162
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,900
Assign tasks to us.

163
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,560
There. There. There.

164
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,780
Yes.

165
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,340
Wipe. Wipe. Wipe.

166
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,390
Just go.

167
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,550
Stop. Stop.

168
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
We've been cleaning for half an hour.

169
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,530
We need to rest now.

170
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,940
Strike a proper balance between work and rest.

171
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,070
We can finally rest.

172
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,820
What are you doing?

173
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Who told you to sit down?

174
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,050
Come on, stand up.

175
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,550
Didn't you say

176
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,640
it's time to rest?

177
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,490
Yes, a proper balance between work and rest.

178
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,240
Stand behind me.

179
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,300
Hurry up.

180
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,930
You're not standing correctly.

181
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,330
Spread your arms and keep a distance.

182
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,820
Hurry up.

183
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:03,970
That's right.

184
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,820
Okay.

185
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,980
Ready.

186
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,940
We're going to start.

187
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,180
What does he want to do?

188
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,940
I have a bad feeling.

189
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,240
[What are you doing? Come and do it!]

[Monster Vintage]

193
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,940
Morning.

194
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,170
Why are you looking at me?

195
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,940
You seem a little normal now.

196
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,950
I have to work today.

197
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,640
Don't bother He Chufeng.

198
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,940
After I come back from work,

199
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,540
we can continue to talk about life.

200
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,020
From verses, ditties, odes and songs to the philosophy of life,

201
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,450
OK?

202
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,720
We have no common language.

203
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,240
I want to talk to He Chufeng.

204
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,120
Where is he?

205
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,630
He Chufeng.

206
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,120
Let's talk.

207
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,590
We think the same way.

208
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,660
Don't talk to him.

209
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,580
He has a class today.

210
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,540
He has work to do.

211
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,840
He needs to use his brain.

212
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,390
It's tiring.

213
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,330
You think I don't use my brain?

214
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,250
Just because I broke up,

215
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,270
you think

216
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,940
I don't know how to use my brain?

217
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,390
You only care about your own happiness.

218
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,390
You're so selfish.

219
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,930
We live in the same building.

220
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,280
I think we are close roommates.

221
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,450
The third floor should have belonged to me.

222
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,900
I gave up my happiness

223
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,610
for our friendship.

224
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,460
But now

225
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,750
you two are a couple,

226
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,730
and you don't want me to be here, right?

227
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,270
You think I'm a burden, right?

228
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,080
Oh, no. He started again.

229
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,390
But

230
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,830
how does he know so many idioms?

231
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,410
He participated in an idiom competition in school.

232
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,620
But I think he used the idiom of advancing secretly by an unknown path

233
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,020
incorrectly.

234
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,180
That's why

235
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,340
he only got the second place.

236
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,520
Who got the first place?

237
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,620
Liu Feng.

238
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,030
Liu Feng?

239
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,330
Who is Liu Feng?

240
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,140
You don't need to know.

241
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:08,770
It doesn't matter.

242
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:11,970
By the way,

243
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,810
did you see

244
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,700
my letter in the mailbox?

245
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,060
No. What letter?

246
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,530
A love letter, right?

247
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,050
Love letter?

248
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,000
What love letter?

249
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,230
It's bilingual.

250
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,240
Bilingual?

251
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,960
No.

252
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,490
He's just kidding. Don't listen to him.

253
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,140
Look at his behavior now.

254
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,690
Sui Yi,

255
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,350
don't mind it.

256
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,490
It's normal that He Chufeng received a love letter.

257
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,630
In high school,

258
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,280
he received love letters

259
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,380
from different girls every week.

260
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,100
Grade 1, Grade 2,

261
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,700
and Grade 3.

262
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,060
From Class 1 to Class 23.

263
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,810
Besides,

264
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,500
let me tell you.

265
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,860
Stop talking.

266
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,020
-When he didn't have time to accept them, -Get up.

267
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,380
he would ask for help from Liu Feng.

268
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,180
He Chufeng.

269
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,020
Tell me.

270
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,060
Who wrote the letter to you?

271
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,180
No one.

272
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,860
And who is

273
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,450
Liu Feng?

274
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:56,860
What?

275
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,500
Tie a necktie.

276
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,020
Tie what?

277
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,620
Go upstairs.

278
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,290
Tie a necktie.

279
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,440
Go upstairs.

280
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,340
You'll be late for work.

281
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,150
Go now.

282
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,850
He Chufeng.

283
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:10,820
Wait for me to come back.

284
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,150
Has Sui Yi left?

285
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,660
Are you satisfied?

286
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,130
I'm very satisfied.

287
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,760
I feel much better after saying those words.

288
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,080
An.

289
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,790
Where should I start in order to give you up?

290
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,330
An.

291
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,040
Do you miss me?

292
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,840
I forgot my receipt.

293
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,910
Where is it?

294
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,720
It's here.

295
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,340
[To Gu Nan]

296
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,100
Did you find it?

297
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:42,800
Yes.

298
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,830
Do you need me to do cleaning for you?

299
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,470
You have so many love letters.

300
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,760
My place is quite clean.

301
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,500
No need to clean it.

302
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,750
He Chufeng,

303
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,020
how many secrets are you hiding from me?

304
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,370
When did you start to receive them?

305
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,990
A few months ago.

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,160
The person who wrote these letters is quite surprising.

307
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,740
Still writing letters in this era.

308
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,280
There are four identical letters.

309
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,840
Why is he obsessed with you?

310
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,010
A prank?

311
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,460
Did you offend someone?

312
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,620
Or did you do something?

313
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,680
It's not a prank.

314
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,340
Fine, I won't ask.

315
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,020
This should be an anonymous letter.

316
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,250
The characters on the envelope are printed.

317
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,090
Obviously, that person doesn't want others to recognize it.

318
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,920
The envelope is ordinary.

319
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,770
This should be Dongba paper.

320
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,550
Dongba paper?

321
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,820
The Dongba priests of Nakhi

322
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,780
used the paper to write Dongba scriptures.

323
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,770
It's heavier than

324
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,210
normal paper because

325
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,780
the paper is thick and has thick fiber.

326
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,480
That's why it's durable.

327
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,640
It also contains canescent wikstroemia,

328
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,960
which makes the paper mothproof.

329
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,340
Some special techniques must have been used.

330
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,260
So,

331
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,500
it's confusing.

332
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,270
Have you dealt with it before?

333
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,230
I tried several ways,

334
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,250
but none of them worked.

335
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,920
Let me try, OK?

336
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:00,990
You?

337
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,220
The more setbacks we encounter,

338
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,700
the braver we should be.

339
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,070
And we should face up to challenges.

340
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,430
With my ability and skills,

341
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,500
it shouldn't be a problem.

342
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,610
But anything could go wrong.

343
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,380
I'm not 100% sure that I'll succeed.

344
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,100
There is still a little

345
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,860
uncertainty.

346
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,160
You must succeed.

347
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,020
Okay.

348
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,030
He has tried to heat it.

349
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,590
So lemon juice or milk is excluded.

350
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,150
Common invisible ink also includes...

351
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,530
Starch is white powder

352
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,620
consisting of amylose and amylopectin.

353
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Amylose that melts in water

354
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,820
[(C6H10O5)N]

355
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,880
is in a curved form.

356
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,890
It curves into a spiral

357
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,290
with intramolecular hydrogen bond.

358
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,660
With iodine tincture,

359
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,340
iodine molecules sneak into the interspace of the spiral

360
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,340
to form clathrate compound

361
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,660
with amylose.

362
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,220
After that, orange, light red,

363
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,750
purple or blue will be shown.

364
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,150
There's another possibility.

365
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,210
NaHCO3.

366
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,780
[NaHCO3]

367
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,360
NaHCO3 is alkali.

368
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,500
Grape juice is sour.

369
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,150
When they meet,

370
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
there will be an acid-base neutralization reaction,

371
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,900
which can help change the color.

372
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,770
[NaHCO3]

373
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,050
You're here.

374
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,440
I haven't started yet.

375
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,590
Do you want to see it?

376
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,580
Wear glasses for your safety.

377
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
Potassium thiocyanate

378
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,950
may also be included in invisible ink.

379
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,420
Ferric chloride and potassium thiocyanate

380
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,470
will generate red iron thiocyanate in a chemical reaction.

381
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,090
The dark red iron thiocyanate complex

382
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,690
will appear

383
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,560
where there are characters.

384
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,980
Not yet.

385
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,860
You need to wait a little longer.

386
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,950
I see.

387
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,220
Ferrous sulfate.

388
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,070
Ferrous sulfate

389
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,740
will have a chemical reaction with

390
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,250
tannin in tea water

391
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,270
and become a substance

392
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,380
that will be oxidized in the air

393
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,980
into iron tannate.

394
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,380
This is the formula

395
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,570
of a type of traditional ink.

396
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,650
Look, the characters will appear soon.

397
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,110
We'll figure out another way.

398
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,910
There's still a way.

399
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,540
Hello, Xu.

400
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,220
I need to talk to you.

401
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,480
Can you do me a favor?

402
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,590
Help me find something.

403
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,780
He even received a love letter.

404
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,010
Sui Yi,

405
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,060
come here.

406
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,890
How is it going recently?

407
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,420
Are you busy?

408
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Apart from some small disputes

409
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,890
among the neighbors to be solved

410
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,050
in the community,

411
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,940
there are a few files to be sorted out.

412
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,040
Nothing else.

413
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,140
The community spoke highly of you.

414
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,090
You should be part of

415
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,020
the case of the game company.

416
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
This case

417
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,800
has reached its critical stage.

418
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,770
We can't afford any mistakes.

419
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,880
It will be their final negotiation next week.

420
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:11,830
Be prepared.

421
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,870
What?

422
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,060
You are not willing?

423
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,570
No, no.

424
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,730
Of course I'm willing.

425
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,870
It's just...

426
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,380
Just tell me your concerns.

427
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,540
This is Mr. Yu's case,

428
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,480
right?

429
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,320
If I suddenly join him,

430
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,140
is it...

431
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,220
Don't worry.

432
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,180
I've talked to Yu.

433
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,670
I'll ask him to help you.

434
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,980
Yu didn't seem to be himself recently.

435
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,030
He's a little slack.

436
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,770
I need him to adjust himself.

437
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,680
You've been in a good state lately.

438
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,190
This case

439
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,070
is very important now.

440
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,030
Seize the opportunity

441
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,860
to prove yourself.

442
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,440
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

443
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,220
They are all here.

444
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,210
Where are the evidence details?

445
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,740
Details? Yes.

446
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,250
There should be details.

447
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,860
Please share them, OK?

448
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,000
And

449
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,100
there are more than these files, right?

450
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,900
I gave you 26 volumes.

451
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,140
These are not enough.

452
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,290
Mr. Zhou said

453
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,050
this case has reached its critical stage.

454
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:27,820
We cannot afford any delay.

455
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,030
Sure.

456
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,740
I'll look for them. Wait a moment.

457
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Where

458
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,600
did I put the files?

459
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,640
Where is my key?

460
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,700
Where is my key?

461
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,880
I think I really didn't bring my key today.

462
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,540
It's really urgent.

463
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,160
I know.

464
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,630
I'll give them to you when I find them.

465
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,580
Take it easy.

466
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,810
OK.

467
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,150
Thank you.

468
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:58,820
Not a big deal.

469
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,020
I'll take these.

470
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:00,570
Okay.

471
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,320
Hello, sir.

472
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,170
Is Mr. Yu here?

473
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:24,640
Hold on.

474
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,610
Hello.

475
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,660
Mr. He, right?

476
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,050
Yes, I have something to be fixed.

477
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,150
Recently,

478
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,620
the lock in my drawer

479
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,260
seemed to be broken.

480
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,220
I can't open it.

481
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,880
Please take a look.

482
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,620
I don't know why it's stuck.

483
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,510
I think it's clogged or something.

484
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,660
It's strange.

485
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,380
Professional.

486
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,380
It's open.

487
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,720
Thank God, they are still here.

488
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,920
I've been pressed hard.

489
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,470
Sui Yi.

490
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,540
You kept rushing me.

491
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,060
You've been pressing me so hard.

492
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,780
Do you think

493
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,660
rushing me will make you the most aggressive

494
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,700
and diligent person in the company?

495
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,370
Do you think so?

496
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,680
There should be more.

497
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,620
I know. You're rushing me again.

498
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,800
It's in my car. I'll get them for you.

499
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,070
Mr. He.

500
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,140
You're still here.

501
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm going to the garage.

502
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,930
Let me walk you down.

503
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:43,980
Mr. He.

504
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,860
Let me walk you down.

505
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,330
This way.

506
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,150
Thank you for today, sir.

507
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,060
I didn't expect you to be

508
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,820
so professional.

509
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,300
You opened it so easily.

510
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,000
Thank you.

511
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,620
Let me walk you down from here.

512
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,220
Really?

513
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,100
I told you

514
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,470
I'll get them from my car,

515
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,570
and you still want to spy on me?

516
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,060
Are you Sui Yi?

517
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,890
Don't you remember me?

518
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,100
We met before.

519
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,010
You were a legal aid lawyer

520
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,180
in our community.

521
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,940
A man

522
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,820
made trouble there,

523
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,660
and there was a fight.

524
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,660
Do you remember?

525
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,890
Thanks to you, Miss Sui.

526
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,030
You

527
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,460
knocked him down on the ground.

528
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,470
As a man,

529
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,510
I didn't dare to stand up against him.

530
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,140
But Miss Sui

531
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,450
just threw him over your shoulders

532
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,440
on the ground.

533
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,900
Miss Sui,

534
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,230
you really got something.

535
00:27:59,330 --> 00:27:59,790
Well.

536
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,080
Miss Sui has practiced martial arts?

537
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,950
Exactly.

538
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,490
No one should offend Miss Sui.

539
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,670
She not only has a smart mouth,

540
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,610
but also is good at fighting.

541
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,350
Amazing.

542
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,640
Awesome.

543
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,590
Awesome.

544
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,490
Sui Yi.

545
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:21,770
Really?

546
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,530
I learned it from my childhood.

547
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,290
It's nothing.

548
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,140
The man who got beaten up by her

549
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,040
was in the hospital for a week.

550
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,770
Poor guy.

551
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,740
Really?

552
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,340
So amazing.

553
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,850
Miss Sui.

554
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,410
Let me buy you a cup of coffee,

555
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,040
OK?

556
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:39,910
Okay.

557
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,720
The elevator is here.

558
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,220
I suddenly remember

559
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,740
the files are not in my car.

560
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,440
I'll go back and look for them.

561
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,930
Sorry, I'm leaving.

562
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,810
Goodbye, Mr. Yu.

563
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,130
[Junhao Law Firm]

564
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:50,970
Bye.

565
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,500
Well done, He Chufeng.

566
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,130
Now you've learned to pretend.

567
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,230
It seems

568
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,120
I just got started to know you.

569
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,260
No.

570
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,450
I still don't know you.

571
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,020
How can you confront someone like him

572
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,320
with a tough attitude?

573
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,580
I can tell

574
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,100
he didn't know your power strength at all.

575
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,380
That's why he always bullied you at work

576
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,860
over and over again.

577
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,140
But after hearing what I just said,

578
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,550
he won't bully you again.

579
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,020
How did you know

580
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,170
he was afraid of being beaten up?

581
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,980
Your boyfriend

582
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,540
a good judge of character.

583
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,650
Are you going back?

584
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,620
Yes.

585
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,690
I have something to do later.

586
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,400
Don't you have anything to tell me?

587
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:45,990
What?

588
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,580
Just go.

589
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,240
I'm going upstairs.

590
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:53,860
I'm leaving.

591
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,870
Go. I'm going upstairs.

592
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,500
You didn't press the button.

593
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,420
You can get out directly.

594
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,710
Anyone here?

595
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,050
I'm here to get something.

596
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,030
Isn't this place lost and found?

597
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,540
I'm here to take my own stuff.

598
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,600
Is there a problem?

599
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:28,970
Tell me.

600
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,190
Is there a problem?

601
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,570
Calm down.

602
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,160
Do you

603
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,700
like this pen?

604
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,420
You must have never seen

605
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,410
such an expensive pen.

606
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,780
Just tell me if you don't want to return it.

607
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,000
Lady.

608
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,180
I'll say it again.

609
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
If this pen is yours,

610
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,790
of course you can take it.

611
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,970
But first,

612
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,520
you have to prove that it belongs to you.

613
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,380
It is mine.

614
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,540
Why should I prove it?

615
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,660
How can you prove

616
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,460
this pen doesn't belong to me?

617
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,940
The thing is you want to take this pen

618
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,900
from me, okay?

619
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:04,800
Lady,

620
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,170
do you have a purchase certificate?

621
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,840
Of course.

622
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,450
Look.

623
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,450
This is it.

624
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,790
I already showed it to him.

625
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,620
But he didn't approve it.

626
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,580
If I went to take a photo of a pen on the counter,

627
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,460
I can say

628
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,640
this pen is mine, right?

629
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,020
Stop arguing.

630
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,680
You just like this pen.

631
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,590
You don't want to return it.

632
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,870
Did you keep any evidence

633
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,590
when you purchased this pen?

634
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,290
Why would I keep that?

635
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,340
Only the poor will keep these things.

636
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,610
Lady,

637
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,670
is there any mark on

638
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,760
the pen you lost?

639
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,770
I told you

640
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,220
the pen I bought is the latest version.

641
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,310
Niukang.

642
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,740
What is Niukang?

643
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,400
You don't know Niukang?

644
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,300
You're just a bumpkin.

645
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,100
See for yourself in the store

646
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,060
and you'll know.

647
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,210
What did you say? You said I'm a bumpkin.

648
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,750
What you said is New Come.

649
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
I'm done talking with you.

650
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,430
Listen.

651
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,440
I engraved a Chinese character on it.

652
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,550
The Chinese character Xiong is on the pen cap.

653
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,720
It's my son's name.

654
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,940
Take a look if you don't believe me.

655
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,540
Excuse me, lady.

656
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,220
I've checked this pen.

657
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,500
How could there be

658
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,530
a character of Xiong engraved on it?

659
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,610
When did this character appear on it?

660
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,830
[Xiong]

661
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,780
What kind of shop is this place?

662
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,300
You'd better close it soon.

663
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:36,790
What's wrong with me?

664
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,500
I've been holding this pen all day.

665
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,300
How could I not notice it?

666
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,100
Have I become an alien?

667
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,880
You just broke up.

668
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:45,750
It's normal.

669
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,330
Hello, welcome.

670
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:02,980
Hello.

671
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,300
Three cups of osmanthus oolong milk tea, please.

672
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,910
One sugar-free. One half sugar.

And one full sugar.

Okay.

00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,990
Do you raise a cat?

678
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,970
I have an Exotic Shorthair cat.

679
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,880
How did you know?

680
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,730
All cat raisers

681
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,820
have a smell.

682
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,380
Really?

683
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,730
I can't smell it myself.

684
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,900
If you have a cat,

685
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,780
you should

686
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,100
keep an eye on it these days.

687
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,390
There is someone in the community abusing cats.

688
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,660
Abusing cats?

689
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,230
Nowadays,

690
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,420
anyone dares to impersonate an appraiser.

691
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,100
What?

692
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,380
You don't like it?

693
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,100
Do you think

694
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,780
I should listen to her

695
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,760
and do a new IQ test?

696
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,190
I'm back.

697
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:36,770
I bought milk tea.

698
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,489
How much sugar?

699
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,350
Full sugar.

700
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,150
It's still hot.

701
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,310
Why did you buy milk tea from this store?

702
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,699
Yuan said it tastes good.

703
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,340
Throw them.

704
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:52,900
Why?

705
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,179
I paid for them.

706
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,280
Don't let me see milk tea from this store.

707
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,150
Here.

708
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,980
How about just throwing them?

709
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,740
Is the milk tea poisonous?

710
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,790
What's wrong with you two?

711
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,960
I'll drink all of the three cups.

712
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,470
Don't drink.

713
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,530
Why?

714
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,850
I paid for them.

715
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,180
They didn't just come to me.

716
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,100
I'll pay you double.

717
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,810
Don't drink.

718
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,100
I will drink.

719
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,840
What happened to your face?

720
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,930
Don't move. Let me see.

721
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,540
No.

722
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,350
Because you refuse to drink the milk tea I bought.

723
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,260
Dilute it before you drink.

724
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,090
It might be better if you drink some water.

725
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,020
Good for you guys.

726
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,030
Even if it's a love letter,

727
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,570
I can understand.

728
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,220
But you don't even want to give me an explanation?

729
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,720
You didn't even mention it the whole night.

730
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,970
Do you think I forgot?

731
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,820
And you wasted my money by not drinking the milk tea.

732
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,320
My goodness.

733
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,900
I drank three cups of milk tea tonight.

734
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,220
You come downstairs at the right time.

735
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,320
Sit down and eat.

736
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,790
No need.

737
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,590
If you don't eat breakfast, you may have hypoglycemia

738
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,840
and become low-spirited.

739
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,000
And you may gain weight.

740
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,620
I brought the Rainbow oatmeal.

741
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,750
It's nutritious enough.

742
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,460
And it won't make me gain weight.

743
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,090
What?

744
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,560
Do you want a cup of coffee?

745
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,720
It can remove the swelling.

746
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,310
You really don't know how to speak properly.

747
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,060
What should I say?

748
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,400
You can say

749
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,020
"Do you want a box of milk

750
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,020
for your oatmeal?"

751
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,810
Or "You're not fat at all."

752
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,130
Why are you laughing?

753
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,090
It's better to keep your mouth shut.

754
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,870
By the way,

755
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,540
what do you want for dinner?

756
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,730
I'll buy them in advance.

757
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,540
No need.

758
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,480
I'll work overtime tonight.

759
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,630
Don't you

760
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,740
have anything to say to me?

761
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,370
You want hand ground coffee?

762
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,060
On it.

763
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,540
Goodbye.

764
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,890
What does that mean?

Wang Qing.

767
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,290
Come here.

768
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,700
Mr. Yu,

769
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,410
you want to see me?

770
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,760
Did you do it on purpose?

771
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,420
Sorry?

772
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,980
Did I do something wrong?

773
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,000
How come there are cases from other countries

774
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,310
in the cases you prepared?

775
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,710
This is the basic common sense.

776
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,660
You've been working in this law firm for quite a while,

777
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,260
don't you know that?

778
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,290
I'm sorry.

779
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,610
I thought similar cases would do.

If you don't want to help,

just tell me.

783
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,640
You don't need to agree to help first

784
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,670
and play a trick later.

785

That's not funny.

786
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,220
I'm sorry.

787
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,120
I'll be more careful next time.

788
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,610
Never mind.

789
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,570
Forget it.

you first.

Why should I use it first?

00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,170
You came here first.

794
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,310
I'm an assistant.

You should use it first.

796
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,460
Being an assistant is just your job.

797
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,070
It doesn't mean you're inferior.

798
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,500
It doesn't mean

799
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,250
you have to meet anyone's request either.

800

Being kind doesn't mean you should be bullied.

It's a misunderstanding.

No one bullied me.

Thank you, Miss Sui.

You really don't need to feel angry for me.

I'm fine, really.
