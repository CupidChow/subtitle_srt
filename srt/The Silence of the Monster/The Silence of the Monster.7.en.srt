I'm not sure about the price.

But if I offer a high price,

I hope you won't think I've gone too far.

This lock

10

is a fabricate with modern techniques.

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,530
It's easy to evaluate its value, right?

12
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,110
That's not true.

13
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,120
My dad took it back anyway.

14
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,650

If someone wants to buy it,

let's just sell it.

Besides,

you know your father.

If it's really special,

it would have been put on record

instead of being hanged here.

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
Since the locksmiths like it,

let's do them a favor

Fine.

You offer them a price.

Don't make the price too low.

00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,560
from the delivery

175
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,170
of this art piece.

176
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,480
This is clearly a breach of contract.

177
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,059
Mr. Ji,

178
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,549
I hope you don't make things difficult for us.

179
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,120
But I think

180
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,140
Mr. Jin is not willing to buy

181
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,299
an art piece with unknown ownership.

182
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,580
I hope you can

183
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,610
deliver our apology to Mr. Jin.

184
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,020
Sorry.

185
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,010
Please.

186
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,710
Ms. Su.

187
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,820
Don't go.

188
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,800
This...

189
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,750
Curator.

190
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,700
You...

191
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,590
You are an outsider.

192
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,480
Who are you to represent the Qianhe Art Museum?

193
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,900
My dad is dead.

194
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm in charge of the Meng family's business.

195
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,610
A fish bone?

196
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,500
Didn't you tell me there is a ghost?

197
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,810
Where is the ghost?

198
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,760
If anything happens,

199
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,080
I hope you are bold enough to take responsibility for the Meng family.

200
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,760
Who are you to mention the Meng family to me?

201
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,740
The person surnamed Meng here is me,

202
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,500
not you.

203
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,960
This is the final work, right?

204
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,780
Do you know what I thought it was before?

205
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,980
Himself.

206
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,210
Why do you know me so well lately?

207
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,250
I specially prepared this

208
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,460
for today.

209
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,420
So you prepared one for yourself.

210
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,440
What about mine?

211
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,170
You're not afraid of it because you are righteous.

212
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,630
I'm afraid of you.

213
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,260
It's OK even if something goes wrong.

214
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,980
I'll be by your side.

215
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,130
Come on.

216
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,380
Why is it a fish bone?

217
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,740
Maybe his lover is a cat.

218
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,500
Didn't you say you saw the works of the sculptor

219
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,140
at the auction?

220
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,590
At the auction,

221
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,520
I saw a dark portrait.

222
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,940
This artist's works

223
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,380
have always been characterized by a dark style.

224
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,040
Why did someone apply hallucinogenic drugs?

225
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,890
Who did it?

226
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,710
If it were the artist,

227
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,660
that means he didn't want other people

228
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,780
to open it.

229
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,580
If it were someone else,

230
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,310
it would be troublesome.

231
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,090
Should we continue?

232
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,420
There must be a huge abyss

233
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,480
behind this lock.

234
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,050
Then unlock it.

235
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,320
He Chufeng.

236
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,930
Why do you have to buy this lock?

237
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,370
I just want to buy it.

238
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:14,860
OK.

239
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,290
I'll think of a way when I finish the deal.

240
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,940
Wait for me! Wait for me!

241
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,180
Ji Xiuyi is the registered person in charge

242
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,070
of the Qianhe Art Museum in the club registration.

243
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,530
It's just a name.

244
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,850
It's not real.

245
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,550
Now there is a dispute over the ownership of One & Only.

246
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,430
We need to discuss with the client

247
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,600
about whether we'll buy this art piece.

248
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,410
Well...

249
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,970
Listen to me.

250
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,170
Here's the thing.

251
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,860
He won't stay long in China

252
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,260
all the year around.

253
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,010
Actually, I make the call in the museum.

254
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,020
We know what you mean.

255
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,740
But we still need to discuss with our client.

256
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,820
That Dong Li's lover.

257
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,370
She would have shown up long ago if she could.

258
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,780
It's been three years.

259
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,180
She didn't even look for it.

260
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,660
What does it mean?

261
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:00,900
It means she's not interested

262
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,180
in this thing.

263
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,380
And we've never seen

264
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,760
any so-called agreement.

265
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,550
We don't know if it still exists.

266
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,460
Listen.

267
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,780
Don't listen to what Ji Xiuyi said.

268
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,690
He's a…

269
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,380
Mr. Meng,

270
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,830
we'll take our leave now.

271
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,080
Keep in touch.

272
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,940
If it works,

273
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,310
I'll pay you twice

274
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
the money that Mr. Jin paid you.

275
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,130
We only have one client.

276
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
A lawyer won't accept any commission from you.

277
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,240
But I'll tell him about your thoughts.

278
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,060
Goodbye.

279
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:06,990
Curator.

280
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,920
About One & Only, I think I need to

281
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,020
make it clear to you again.

282
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
I don't care about

283
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,530
my dad's plan back then.

284
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,980
I don't care about

285
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,260
the filthy business between you and him either.

286
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,870
I'm the owner of the art museum now.

287
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,550
I hope you can recognize your position.

288
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,860
Don't cross any unnecessary lines.

289
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,130
No matter what the lines are,

290
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,230
you can't erase

291
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,840
the relationship between me and him.

292
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,460
The Qianhe Art Museum belongs to me.

293
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,580
I'm Meng Qianhe's son.

294
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,810
My name has also been registered for the Qianhe Art Museum.

295
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,510
Do you have a charger for this cellphone?

296
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,080
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,690
This type of cellphones has stopped production.

298
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,260
I don't have a charger for it.

299
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,340
But

300
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,950
I can download the data in your cellphone.

301
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,420
You just need to buy a new cellphone.

302
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,030
Okay.

303
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,590
Which one is the latest?

304
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,660
These three are the latest.

305
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,690
This is a 5G cellphone from Huawei.

306
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,630
This?

307
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,710
5...

308
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,240
5G?

309
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,100
Okay, this 5G cellphone then.

310
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,490
You pay through WeChat or Alipay?

311
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,660
You pay through WeChat or Alipay?

312
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,680
OK.

313
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,670
[Junhao Law Firm]

314
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,160
Miss Sui.

315
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,780
OK. I'll follow it up.

316
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,680
I'll send it to your email later.

317
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,280
Sui Yi.

318
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,980
You're welcome.

319
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,060
But please be prepared, Mr. Jin.

320
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,860
If we can't verify it,

321
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,660
considering the subsequent

322
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,540
legal risks,

323
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,780
I suggest you

324
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,950
shouldn't buy this collectible.

325
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:09,849
Okay.

326
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,180
We'll try our best.

327
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,359
Mr. Jin still insists on his own ideas.

328
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,980
But if we purchase it,

329
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,099
there may be many problems in the future.

330
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,300
That's right.

331
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,579
But our duty

332
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,170
is to meet the client's request.

333
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,569
The Qianhe Art Museum

334
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,960
is expected to confirm the ownership problem with us

335
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,810
soon.

336
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,460
After all, Meng Ziyang

337
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,580
really wants to ink this deal.

338
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,780
Ms. Su,

339
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,410
I want to give it a try.

340
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,740
Go on.

341
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,610
I want to find

342
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,280
Dong Li's lover mentioned by Mr. Ji.

343
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,080
This is not a job

344
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,300
that someone is willing to rush to do.

345
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,020
I know.

346
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,770
I won't delay other work.

347
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,340
What's your plan?

348
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,300
I noticed that

349
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,810
many art pieces created by artist Dong Li

350
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,340
were auctioned

351
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
through the Qianhe Art Museum.

352
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,780
So I want to start with the Qianhe Art Museum.

353
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,010
I might find more information

354
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,160
about Dong Li.

355
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,040
When will you find her

356
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,440
like this?

357
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,930
I want to

358
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,110
meet Mr. Ji again.

359
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,420
I think he is the one

360
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,870
who knows the most currently.

361
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,210
Why are you so confident that

362
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,560
he will tell you the truth?

363
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,140
Sui Yi,

364
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,320
you are still young.

365
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,300
You are ambitious and enthusiastic.

366
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,730
This is what makes me admire you.

367
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,210
But

368
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,130
as a senior, I have to tell you.

369
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,940
When you choose not to be part of something,

370
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,290
you won't be held responsible

371
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,900
even if it has a bad ending.

372
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,580
But once you choose to

373
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,860
be part of it,

374
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
it will be your fault

375
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,980
when it ends badly,

376
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,140
even if it's not your fault.

377
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,780
Ms. Su, I understand.

378
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:07,980
Hello.

379
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,720
Sui Yi is your trainee?

380
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,910
You're really ill-informed.

381
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,500
Good.

382
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,610
This girl is just like you.

383
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
Let her get some training with you.

384
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,320
But her choice may be different.

385
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,850
Everyone has a bumpy life experience.

386
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,760
[Appraiser Robin]

387
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,790
[Robin]

388
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,190
Ji Xiuyi?

389
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,290
That young man.

390
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,380
I remember him.

391
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,490
But I heard some rumors

392
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,810
when he was

393
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,190
with Meng Qianhe.

394
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,540
He really did a lot

395
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,810
for their family.

396
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
He has a low profile.

397
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,320
But it seems that Meng Qianhe's son

398
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,870
has refused to accept him all the time.

399
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,390
Is there any grudge between them?

400
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,450
I've told you about their relationship.

401
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,940
It's said that

402
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,880
Meng Ziyang's biological mother's death

403
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,430
was related to Ji Xiuyi.

404
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,290
It's even said that

405
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,800
Ji Xiuyi is Meng Qianhe's illegitimate son.

406
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,740
They're just rumors though.

407
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,260
Maybe

408
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,970
only they themselves know

409
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,980
the truth.

410
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,300
Look.

411
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,420
This is more complicated.

412
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,290
I've felt it when I was there.

413
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,390
Don't you think your

414
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,780
empathy is too great?

415
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,230
It's called the perception to the world.

416
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,520
But Granny,

417
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,660
how do you know

418
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,750
about these things?

419
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,170
I was

420
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,010
a collector to some extent back then.

421
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,990
Of course I know more.

422
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,210
Then why did you quit?

423
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
If you didn't,

424
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,580
you would be the number one in the world of collectors now.

425
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,020
Everyone has his own ambition.

426
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
I have to go.

427
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,570
I'm going to drink coffee.

428
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,250
Goodbye, Granny.

429
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,490
Goodbye, Granny.

430
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,320
My brain cells are exhausted today.

431
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,470
I'm going to have another bowl.

432
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:46,950
There is nothing left.

433
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,890
This is your third bowl.

434
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,160
Pour more water if you want more.

435
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,860
Why didn't you pour more water

436
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,960
when you cooked?

437
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,940
When you choose not to be part of something,

438
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,390
you won't be held responsible

439
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,040
even if it has a bad ending.

440
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,660
But once you choose to

441
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,860
be part of it,

442
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,460
it will be your fault

443
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,260
when it ends badly,

444
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,390
even if it's not your fault.

445
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,830
[There's hot soup in the kitchen.]

446
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,700
Hello, mom.

447
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,140
Who made this for you?

448
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,760
Why did you ask who made it?

449
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,340
Why can't it be your daughter who made it?

450
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,110
You can't make this.

451
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,150
I know you, OK?

452
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,680
You moved to a new place?

453
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,300
Ms. Wu.

454
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,870
Have you put a GPS on me?

455
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,140
This table.

456
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,220
This bowl and this spoon.

457
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,860
They are obviously not yours.

458
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,070
You can't afford them.

459
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,130
You're breaking your daughter's heart.

460
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,270
I just moved to a new place.

461
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,860
My friend introduced me here.

462
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,140
The rent here is cheap.

463
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,040
The landlord is very nice.

464
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,330
The tableware and the soup

465
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,200
are all from the landlord.

466
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,190
Did you pay for the meal?

467
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,650
I'm about to get my salary.

468
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,480
What good stuff can you buy with your low salary?

469
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,780
Just eat.

470

Then why do you want to do it?

494

there's still a little hope.

00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,290
Miss Sui,

679
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,070
are you alright?

00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,090
I'm fine.

681
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,230
I've been sneezing a lot lately.

682
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I don't know why.

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,150
Is it because I moved to a new place

and I'm not used to it?

692
