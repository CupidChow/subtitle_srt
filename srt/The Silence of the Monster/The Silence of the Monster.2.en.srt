5
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,910
It's your dad.

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:10,979
Hello?

7
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,680
When would you be back home?

8
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,510
I have plans for the next few months.

9
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,930
What work will make you

10
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:19,360
even have no time to return home?

11
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,300
You always dream of being a star.

12
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,110
Listen,

13
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,820
the Su family won't have this fate.

14
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,030
I've already debuted.

15
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,460
What do you mean?

16
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,940
You always make a scene

17
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,300
on the news.

18
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,530
Aren't you ashamed?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
When I was unknown,

20
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,180
you thought I was embarrassing.

21
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,720
Now I'm famous.

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,480
You still think I'm embarrassing.

23
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,680
You won't be satisfied no matter what.

24
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,650
I'm satisfied if you don't mess around.

25
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,750
I asked someone to find you a job.

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
The county kindergarten teacher.

27
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,760
A decent job.

28
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,430
I won't go back.

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,070
Do you know how many connections I've used?

30
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,660
You must come back.

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,320
Don't mess around outside.

32
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,220
You've disgraced our Su family.

33
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,490
There were only seven days of surveillance.

34
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,880
And it didn't capture her house.

35
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,260
There's no problem with the lock.

36
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,360
Have you searched the room carefully?

37
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,490
I did,

38
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,650
but found nothing.

39
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,650
Where could he be?

40
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,550
Did he go out?

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,980
But he's not captured.

42
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,920
Then...

43
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,390
You must be hungry.

44
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,820
Do you want to go out for dinner?

45
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,630
What time is it now?

46
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,900
The lock problem is still unsolved.

47
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,900
Since you're here,

48
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,890
you should take responsibility.

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,640
You're a lawyer.

50
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,970
You're so thoughtless.

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,620
I'm a locksmith.

52
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,150
I'm only responsible for my lock.

53
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,660
Didn't now someone broke in because of

54
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,860
the problem of your lock?

55
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,820
Does the fact that someone broke in mean

56
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,190
there must be something wrong with my lock?

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,830
So let's go out to eat

58
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,660
and discuss it.

59
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,140
Xiaoyue.

60
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,240
Let's call the police.

61
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,690
I don't think we can count on them.

62
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,589
No.

63
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,140
We can't call the police.

64
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,150
We've checked the house.

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,280
Nothing unusual.

66
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,220
It must be that

67
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,700
Miss Su, you were too busy at work,

68
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,220
so you felt psychologically stressful.

69
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,500
So let's go out to eat

70
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,680
and relax.

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,180
Everything will be fine when you come back.

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,270
Book a suite for me.

73
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,770
Now.

74
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,380
Thank you.

75
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,780
I'll do as you say.

76
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,880
I'll trust you one more time.

77
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,980
Xiaoyue.

78
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,600
Is this really okay?

79
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,250
I have no other choice.

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,460
Let's try again.

81
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,180
This is my name card.

82
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,050
If you need anything,

83
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,120
give me a call anytime.

84
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,460
When you performed last time,

85
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,980
you danced very well.

86
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,100
Have you seen our performance?

87
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,960
I've seen it online.

88
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,700
You didn't expect me to be like this

89
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,540
in real life, did you?

90
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,110
How should I put it?

91
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,140
It's a bit different.

92
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,240
How?

93
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,540
You are a sparkling

94
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,240
little princess on stage.

95
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,170
You are too pretty to be real.

96
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,960
Sometimes I think

97
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,230
a girl like you

98
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,360
won't have worries in life, right?

99
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,110
Those are public personas

100
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,090
designed by the company.

101
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,930
Actually, I'm not that glamorous.

102
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,860
But I think you are more real.

103
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,160
This kind of thing

104
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,290
will be painful to anyone.

105
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,680
If it were me,

106
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,970
I don't know how to deal with it.

107
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,310
You're really great.

108
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,510
Actually,

109
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,920
I hope you don't have to bear so much.

110
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,960
I hope you can be like a little girl

111
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,539
who lives a tranquil life

112
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,460
that she wants.

113
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,820
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,140
I didn't mean to make you cry.

115
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,000
I...

116
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,060
Thank you.

117
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,100
Everyone in the city

118
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,700
plays a different role.

119
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,310
They may look happy,

120
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,960
but they might be lonely too.

121
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,640
Hello, mom.

122
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,590
You scared me.

123
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,630
You didn't answer my calls.

124
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,500
Where did you go?

125
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,780
My phone died.

126
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,980
I just charged it.

127
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,900
Didn't we agree to send me a message

128
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,300
before the phone ran out of battery?

129
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,310
Why didn't you inform me?

130
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,020
I know.

131
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,100
But I can't guarantee that.

132
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,220
I'm not a power bank.

133
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,380
You...

134
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,400
Do you need money recently?

135
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,640
I have enough money.

136
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,540
I'll get my salary next week.

137
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,700
By the way, mom,

138
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,160
let me ask you something.

139
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,540
Have you seen the kind of lock store that is not open

140
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,600
on the roadside but in a fancy building?

141
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,990
What's so strange about that?

142
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,390
Wouldn't it be better for business

143
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,230
if a competent owner choses a nicer location?

144
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,600
Right.

145
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,490
I have to go.

146
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,240
Your dad is urging me to cook.

147
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,980
Because we were worried about you,

148
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,500
your dad and I haven't eaten yet.

149
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,970
You should eat too.

150
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,660
Okay, I got it.

151
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,290
Bye.

152
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,650
How am I going to live in the future?

153
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,500
I even broke his glasses

154
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,180
today.

155
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,400
Where was he

156
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,950
hiding?

157
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,690
How did he get in?

158
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,280
He must still be in the room.

159
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,480
In the room?

160
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,560
Why can't we find him?

161
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,160
-Morning. -Morning.

162
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,850
Are you exercising?

163
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,380
Be careful of your waist.

164
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,620
It's okay. Thank you.

165
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,740
Are you the new  legal aid lawyer

166
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,860
in our community, right?

167
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,220
Yes.

168
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,000
Hello, madam.

169
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,220
I'm Sui Yi, an intern lawyer

170
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,440
of Junhao Law Firm.

171
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,230
I was busy yesterday.

173
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,720
I heard that we have

174
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,890
a new aid lawyer.

175
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:15,870
It's you, right?

176
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,230
Yes, it's me.

177
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,820
Hello.

178
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,260
I am Sui Yi, an intern lawyer

179
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,340
of Junhao Law Firm.

180
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,620
Nice to meet you.

181
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,370
Are you Chen Xiaoyuan?

182
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,400
Hello.

183
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm the new police officer

184
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,550
in our community police station.

185
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,570
I'm Jia Xiaoguo.

186
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,980
Jia Xiaoguo.

187
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,390
My name is Chen Xiaoyuan.

188
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,560
Sui Yi.

189
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,340
Your names are so easy to remember.

190
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:35,940
Yes.

191
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
I bought this breakfast.

192
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,580
Let's eat together.

193
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,180
I'm fine. I've eaten.

194
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:39,680
Thank you.

195
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,950
Help yourself.

196
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,860
I've eaten too.

197
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,540
Thank you.

198
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,740
Okay.

199
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,990
I'm in charge of our community.

200
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,680
Although I just became a regular employee,

201
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,780
you can tell me

202
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,130
if you need anything.

203
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,720
Officer Xiaoguo.

204
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,410
You can tell me if you need anything.

205
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,160
We're a family.

206
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,360
Xiaoyuan told you not to worry.

207
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,660
Okay.

208
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,440
Mr. He.

209
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,150
Come here.

210
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,000
Hurry.

211
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,080
Come here.

212
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,940
Look at him.

213
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,770
Let me tell you.

214
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,080
He is one of two handsome men

215
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,510
in our community.

216
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,090
So handsome.

217
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,470
♫Making noise alone and messing around alone. It's also good to be alone♫

Robin?

221
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,750
You even know that?

222
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,360
♫I pretend that I'm not that sensitive♫

223

Are you sure?

224
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,810
Yes.

♫And I hate that I'm not brave enough♫

226
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,970
His name is He Chufeng.

227
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,660
He's a great locksmith.

228
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:50,050
♫I chose to run away cleverly every time♫

229
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,100
Why is he here?

230
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,970
To give lectures.

231
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,400
To give lectures?

232
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,250
Isn't he a locksmith?

233
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:58,490
♫My heart broke into pieces, and no one wanted to pick them up♫

234
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:06,650
♫It was like the speed of a planet falling to the earth, which was so surprising♫

Thank you.

240
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,120
You're welcome.

Mr. Zhou doesn't know I'm here.

322

broke into Xiaoyue's house.

327
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,990
It's gotten to this point.

328
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,030
Can't she call the police?

329
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,900

330
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,180
Xiaoyue is a public figure.

331
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,300
So what?

332
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,780
Can't a public figure guarantee

333
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
their security by law?

334
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,380

Sir,

339
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,330
can we talk about it?

340

Don't go to the police station.

341
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,940
She's a public figure.

342
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,630
Officer.

343
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,520
I'm so mad.

344
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,450
These people...

345
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,700
They don't even know

346
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,270
what the truth is.

347
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,100
Why are they talking nonsense online?

348
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,510
He's really something.

349
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,900
He said things more real than what I saw with my own eyes.

350
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,310
Look.

351
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,370
This is the power of the fan's

352
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,200
anger blazing.

353
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,550
It's like they were there.

354
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,660
Well...

355
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,240
how are you sure

356
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,950
he has been hiding in Xiaoyue's house

357
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,750
and never came out?

358
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,370
It's simple.

359
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,740
Because my lock can't be broken.

360
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,070
Yes.

361
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,940
We won't deny it.

362
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,200
Is there any other evidence?

363
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,110
Well.

364
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,340
Robin, the famous detective,

365
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,990
will answer it for you.

366
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,930
There's only one truth.

367
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:39,990
Okay.

368
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,670
First, Su Xiaoyue said

369
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,630
she moved in on the night of the concert.

370
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,470
She was in a hurry

371
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,600
and didn't have time to clean.

372
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,430
But the room was clean.

373
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,430
To keep it so clean,

374
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,070
someone has to clean it all the time.

375
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,210
Second,

376
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,890
this room was so dry,

377
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,930
but the towel was wet.

378
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,050
So before we came here,

379
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,890
someone has taken a shower.

380
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,120
That's disgusting.

381
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,760
He Chufeng unlock the door for her on Monday.

382
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,610
It's impossible for Chufeng's lock to be broken.

383
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,040
She lives on the 46th floor.

384
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,450
There's only one possibility left.

385
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,340
Before Chufeng changed her lock,

386
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,800
this person has moved in.

387
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,270
Okay.

388
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,430
For now, your lock

389
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,330
can never be broken.

390
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,800
-Even if it's true. -It is true.

391
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,180
Yes, it is true.

392
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,580
But that day,

393
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,540
we searched every corner of Xiaoyue's house.

394
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,300
No one was there.

395
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,670
Where was he hiding?

396
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,780
Are you sure you've seen all the places?

397
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,700
He might be

398
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,750
hiding somewhere we can see.

399
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,940
He has been hiding under the bed.

400
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,030
When Su Xiaoyue leaves,

401
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,890
he will climb out of the bed

402
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,900
and move freely in her home.

403
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,500
He wore her clothes,

404
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,280
bathed with her towel,

405
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,340
and helped her clean up.

406
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,590
I had the same reaction.

407
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,610
Wait.

408
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,020
At that time,

409
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,840
you knew he was hiding under the bed.

410
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,070
Why not just pulled him out?

411
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,500
It's to keep a suspense.

412
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,660
You know,

413
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,640
most famous detectives

414
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,490
only reveal the truth when it's the most dangerous.

415
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,510
We're not detectives.

416
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,100
You go ahead.

417
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,010
When will you take off the glasses?

418
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,140
Now.

419
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,490
I feel dizzy wearing it.

420
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,170
Here.

421
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,190
We did look under the bed,

422
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,940
but we didn't see anything.

423
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,140
That stalker fan

424
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,030
put himself under the bed

425
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,930
and lasted for half an hour.

426
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,370
This has exceeded

427
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,770
the limit of physical fitness we know.

428
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,950
So we didn't think that way.

429
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,880
We subconsciously thought

430
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,160
if we wouldn't do that,

431
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,540
no one else would do that.

432
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,990
That's why we entered a delusion

433
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,130
and neglected

434
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,130
some kind of person would commit something abnormal

435
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,070
for their own selfish desires.

436
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,880
But it's just a speculation.

437
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,330
We don't know where he's hiding,

438
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,390
but we have enough reason to believe that

439
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,660
he won't leave

440
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,940
but stay in that house.

441
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,630
Because he's a stalker fan.

442
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:41,990
That's right.

443
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,310
It's not easy

444
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,650
to enter an idol's room.

445
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,910
So he chose to stay inside.

446
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,820
That's why you purposely

447
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,030
proposed to dine out together

448
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,520
to make him think Xiaoyue would go back that night.

449
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,520
But you actually locked the door.

450
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,020
So he couldn't open the door

451
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,900
and leave before you came.

452
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,460
Why didn't you go there earlier

453
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,890
but waited until the next afternoon?

454
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,380
We confirmed with Su Xiaoyue.

455
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,070
She had a job at that time.

456
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,060
The stalker fan

457
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,150
has seen us a day ago.

458
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,640
He must be very vigilant.

459
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,020
He will never come out again.

460
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,870
So it's better

461
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,840
wait and see.

462
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,420
During Su Xiaoyue's working hours,

463
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,550
he's likely to let his guard down.

464
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,310
But then again,

465
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,600
how did he get in?

466
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,930
Is Su Xiaoyue's lock a password lock?

467
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,610
The password and fingerprint.

468
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,350
Password lock?

469
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,930
It can't be her birthday.

470
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,330
Everyone knows it.

471
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,790
It's not.

472
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,050
How do you know it's not?

473
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,300
Because she didn't set the password.

474
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,000
Are all the doors

475
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,100
non-functional to you?

476
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,530
That's right.

477
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,150
He's a killer.

478
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,150
He kills all kinds of locks and safe boxes.

479
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,220
But don't worry.

480
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,160
He's very picky.

481
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,740
He is not willing to open all locks.

482
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,560
Then,

483
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,190
how did he get Xiaoyue's fingerprint?

484
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,120
Chufeng.

485
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,450
Aren't you a detective?

486
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,820
Answer her.

487
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,890
Let the detective Robin

488
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,740
answer all your questions.

489
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,740
Since he's finished his sentence,

490
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,060
we're not sure

491
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,370
if he'll come back to you.

492
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,700
Anyway, be careful.

493
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,060
-Take care of yourself. -It's so hard to find the bathroom.

494
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,220
It's like a maze.

495
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,680
You'll find it if you come a few more times.

496
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,750
No, no, no.

497
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm a good citizen.

498
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,940
Let's go.

499
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,620
Chufeng.

500
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,430
You should be careful too.

501
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:04,770
Go.

502
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,410
Be careful of what?

503
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,330
Let's go. It's okay.

504
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,840
-Hurry up. -Come on.

505
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,590
I'm starving.

506
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:24,890
Oh my god!

507
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,360
Su Xiaoyue was arrested?

508
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,020
What?

509
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,900
It's a rumor.

510
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,350
The explosive news nowadays

511
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,500
needs time to confirm.

512
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,070
Besides,

513
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,970
the person involved is here.

514
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,510
Where?

515
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,490
Here.

516
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,370
Wait.

517
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,480
Do you have a trash can?

518
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,020
Is this you?

519
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,230
Look.

520
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,780
I got caught on camera.

521
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,200
So I said

522
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,740
we know the situation the best.

523
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,310
Then what happened?

524
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,860
Why did the news say

525
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,770
Su Xiaoyue was arrested?

526
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,340
She called the police

527
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,220
as a victim.

528
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,630
She needs to go to the Public Security Bureau to make a statement.

529
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,660
This is the normal procedure.

530
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,660
The Internet nowadays

531
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,700
is full of

532
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
a lot of wild speculations

533
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,700
and non-objective emotional remarks.

534
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,840
But Zhen, you're different.

535
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,160
You have to open up your eyes

536
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,700
and stay sober.

537
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,750
I have to stay sober.

538
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,500
Waitress, order.

539
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,490
Coming.

540
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,590
But this little lawyer is in big trouble.

541
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,760
She caused a lot of trouble to her client.

542
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,760
I guess when she goes back,

543
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,560
she'll be scolded by her boss.

544
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,580
You should have thought about it

545
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
before calling the police.

546
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,160
You shouldn't let everyone

547
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,740
get caught up in your impulsiveness.

548
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,800
Don't get involved in this.

549
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,730
As a fan of the person involved,

550
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,850
it's inappropriate for you to get involved.

551
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,430
Mr. Zhou.

552
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,120
Am I really wrong?

553
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,620
What's going on?

554
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,570
Zhen.

555
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,940
Is my takeaway ready?

556
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,510
Wait a minute.

557
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,430
Hello, Sui Yi.

558
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,800
You left your key at home?

559
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,210
Well,

560
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,890
let Mr. He open the door for you?

561
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,650
No, no, no.

562
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,250
I'll figure it out myself.

563
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,740
Are you sure you can do it?

564
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,550
Okay, I'll hang up now.

565
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,120
Bye.

566
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,380
What are you thinking?

567
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,840
I'll finish it if you don't eat.

I've transferred the money to you.

Many people

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,290
can open this lock in six seconds.

No, no, no.

596

You used four seconds at most.

Okay.

You're welcome.

00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,610
Then I...

601
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,040
Okay.

602
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,060
Wait.

603
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,540
Can I borrow your phone?

604
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,440
My name is He Chufeng.

605
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,660
Why did her lock

606
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,990
open so easily?

607
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,600
Is it the same as what happened to Su Xiaoyue?

608
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,520
He Chufeng.

609

Where can't we meet?

610
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,429
It's a bit messy.

611
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,540
I've been staying here for almost half a year.

612
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,400
I didn't find anything wrong.

613
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,080
What a coincidence.

614
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,110
Besides, I'm not a big star like Xiaoyue.

615
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,980
No one will do anything to me.

616
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,580
Although my landlord looks scary,

617
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,910
he's actually quite nice.

618
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,820
These furniture

619
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,970
are all newly bought by him.

620
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,950
He left them to me.

621
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
He seemed to move to another place

622
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,700
for some work reason.

623
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,640
So he rented this house to me.

624
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,230
The length and width are both five millimeters.

625
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,940
The lens are 1 mm diameter.

that can be bought on the market.

630
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,620
This is a camera?

631
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,850
And the most advanced

632
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,950
pinhole camera,

633
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,560
PIR.

634
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,090
What's PIR?

635
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
Passive InfraRed.

636
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,930
When there's no one in the room, it will remain dormant.

637
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,150
It's automatically activated once it's detected.

638
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,200
So it's very effective.

639
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,460
It doesn't need to be plugged in,

640
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,340
and avoids changing batteries frequently.

641
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,380
But this used to be a technology used by

642
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,150
scientific researchers to record wild animals.

643
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,800
But now...

644
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,790
What about the memory card?

645
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,160
This kind of camera

646
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,360
usually use real-time transmission signal.

647

662
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,240
You asked me about his personality.

663
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,580
He's a weirdo.

664

Sometimes he's so mean.

665

Why do we rent together?

666

To save money, of course.

No, no, no.

We were classmates in high school.

670

But then I transferred to another school.

671
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,460
It was about a year ago.

672

We met again.

673
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,620
He was looking for a house.

674

is amazing.

677
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,380
He changed the anti-theft door

678
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,370
for me.

679
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

680
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,270
He can open any lock.

681
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,080
He opened it just

682
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,390
with his tool.

683
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,720
He's a security expert at the police station.

684
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,320
I think Detective Chen is close to him.

685
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,580
I wanted to introduce him to my daughter,

686
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,750
but he didn't talk much.

687
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,820
It's hard to communicate.

688
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,420
What if a stranger knocks?

689
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,900
If there is a stranger knocking,

690
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,830
we first

691
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,800
need to confirm their identity

692
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,510
before we decide whether to open the door,

693
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,530
in case the bad guys come in and rob.

694
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,480
If only the elderly and children

695
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,780
are at home,

696
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,600
when someone wants to enter your home

697
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,050
for a water or gas meter reading or even for maintenance,

698
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,330
politely refuse

699
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,870
before being sure of

700
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,730
the person's identity.

701
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,780
Don't open the door so easily.

702
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,050
The place the thieves often use

703
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,900
are like the window here.

704
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,270
So when you're at home,

705
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,670
pay special attention

706
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,830
and don't put the key

707
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,820
under the flowerpot, the mat,

708
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,640
or on the door frame,

709
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,920
or even the shoe racks

710
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,560
and the recess for fire hydrant.

711
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,600
These are all very dangerous measures.

712
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,570
You must remember.

713
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,790
For new locks like combination locks,

714
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,570
pay attention if there's someone behind you

715
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,250
when you enter the password.

716
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,110
When you enter the password,

717
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,670
we can use one hand

718
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,510
to cover the other hand.

719
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,210
Then enter the password.

720
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,450
That's more secure.

721
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,800
The combination lock is not safe now.

722
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,140
The normal lock is more secure.

723
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,100
My key is always lost

724
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,450
and can't be found.

725
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:14,820
Auntie,

726
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,220
if you keep losing the key,

727
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,770
I suggest you

728
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,100
give it to

729
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,080
whom you trust.

730
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,910
Then when you can't find it,

731
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,180
you can ask that person for it.

732
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,560
Chufeng.

733
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,990
Tell me more about it.

734
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,330
What should I do

735
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,400
if I forget the password?

736
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,970
I have a bad memory.

737
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,090
I keep forgetting.

738
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,660
No use writing anywhere.

739
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,930
Uncle, don't worry.

740
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,820
If you often forget the password,

741
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,860
I suggest you switch back to

742
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,110
a normal anti-theft door.

743
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,690
That way, it's safer.

744
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,370
