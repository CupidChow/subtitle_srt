so he could no longer pick locks.

I don't know why.

129
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,890

I did the right thing.

131
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,170
Did it occur to you that

00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,150
he would hate you for what you did?

133

Yes.

134
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,420
That's why I wanted to make up for him

135

killing a taxi driver.

No.

The phone number that sent a message to He Chufeng

166

is registered with Gu Nan's name.

That number belongs to Gu Nan?

Yes.

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,020
Nothing.

175
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,820
Did you inform Sui Yi's mother?

176
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,060
She will be here tonight.

177
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,660
Okay.

178
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,550
What a long day.

179
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,420
Everything will be fine.

180
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,710
Sui Yi will get better.

181
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,790
Chufeng will be clear of suspicion.

182
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,250
The bad guy will be punished.

183
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,370
Everything will be fine.

184
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,420
I'll go to the police station later.

185
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,800
He can't think straight.

186
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,780
I'll go take a look.

187
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,540
I'll leave Sui Yi

188
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,980
to you.

189
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll wait for you.

190
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,270
Bye.

191
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,520
Sui Yi has been saved.

192
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,610
She is in Zhongnan Hospital.

193
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,750
Sui Yi has been saved.

194
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,250
She is in Zhongnan Hospital.

195
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,990
Sui Yi has been saved.

196
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,470
She is in Zhongnan Hospital.

197
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,610
Who was that?

198
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,470
Sui Yi has been saved.

199
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,180
Sui Yi has been saved.

200
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:25,890
[Three days later]

201
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,390
Why didn't you go in?

202
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,180
Auntie.

203
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,380
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,000
You did fail me

205
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,280
and Sui Yi.

206
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,650
But Chufeng,

207
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,020
it's not your fault.

208
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,160
It's the bad guy's fault.

209
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,560
The bad guy did it.

210
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,140
Not you.

211
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,140
Auntie.

212
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,560
I failed to protect her.

213
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,820
Then do your best to protect her

214
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,980
for the rest of your life.

215
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,790
I will.

216
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,450

her vocal cords were severely damaged.

he called another person?

259
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,430
[Yes, there's another person. But I couldn't tell who he is.]

260
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,210
Considering the time, Jin Jian and Ji Xiuyi are excluded.

261
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,990
There should be someone else.

262
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,120
I know, Miss Sui.

263
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,780
This information is very important.

264
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,570
Thank you.

265
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,270

If you remember anything else,

please let me know.

[I'm afraid they'll do something bad to Chufeng.]

269
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,490
Don't worry, Miss Sui.

270
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,220
We will dispatch police officers to the hospital.

271
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm sorry.

Sui Yi.

274
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,260
We came here every day before,

275
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,020
and you didn't wake up.

276
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,500
We're not here today, and you woke up.

277
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,360
Here.

278
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,310
[I want to wake up when you're not around.]

279
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,500
What's wrong with your voice?

280
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,510
[The doctor said I can't speak for a while. I can't be as noisy as you.]

281
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,030
Sui Yi said

282
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,470
there's another person besides Gu Nan.

283
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,830
Did Gu Nan have an accomplice?

284
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,030
I don't know.

285
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,060
Do you know

286
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,580
who he was usually in touch with?

287
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,860
As far as I know,

288
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,260
he didn't have many friends.

289
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,700
Should I ask someone to look for him?

290
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,000
Any clue?

291
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,630
I'm a little bit worried that this guy

292
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,940
will hurt Sui Yi again.

293
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,060
After all, he knows Sui Yi is still alive.

294
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,810
He might even come at you.

295
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know.

296
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,410
Robin.

297
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,460
You didn't finish your physical examination last time.

298
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,530
Do you want to finish it this time?

299
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,800
What are you talking about?

300
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,380
I finished it last time.

301
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,490
You didn't do the general check-up last time.

302
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,930
Why didn't you do it?

303
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,090
The fight only caused body injuries.

304
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,340
An is always worried about me.

305
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,150
I'm in good health.

306
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,250
Look, I...

307
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,670
Don't move.

308
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,050
I think it will take some time to recover.

309
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,410
It's okay. I'll get well soon.

310
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,230
Don't worry.

311
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,660
I have work to do.

312
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,170
Let me take you home first, OK?

313
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,720
What do you want exactly?

314
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,340
What's wrong?

315
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,970
Have you really been that busy lately?

316
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,710
I have been busy with my work recently.

317
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,100
You're so busy that you don't even have time

318
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,700
to reply on WeChat?

319
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,850
I'll reply.

320
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,710
I told my dad about us.

321
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,160
He wants to see you.

322
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,900
Let's talk about it later.

323
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,720
I'm not ready yet.

324
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,490
Robin.

325
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,760
What's wrong with you lately?

326
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,280
Since what happened to Sui Yi,

327
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,580
you've become more weird.

328
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,690
I'm fine.

329
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,980
I'll adjust myself.

330
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,050
Are you really okay?

331
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,150
If it's because what happened to Sui Yi,

332
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,250
we've been taking care of her

333
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,030
and helping her all this time.

334
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,050
I'm sure she will get better.

335
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,290
I kept remembering things in the past.

336
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,580
Like flashes.

337
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,860
There're many people in the flashes,
