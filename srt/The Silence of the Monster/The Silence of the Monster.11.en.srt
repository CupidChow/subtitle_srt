Brother?

Is he your illegitimate son?

An illegitimate son?

He looks like 12 years old.

Did you have a love trauma before meeting me?

Does he look like him?

I don't think so.

You didn't see

35

Chufeng when he was in high school.

36

Nothing.

40

Look, I think they look alike.

41
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,370
Don't talk to me.

42

I'm frozen now.

43

Except one thing.

What's that?

45
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,460
The mouth. Their mouths don't look the same.

46

Right?

47
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,180
I think so too.

Talk nicely. Don't fight.

51

Just like your mother,

You have no right to mention my mom.

55

I have no right?

You've learned to steal and you are saying I have no right?

This is the owner.

62
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,579
Maybe the kid is immature

63
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,390
and just thought it's fun.

64
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,740
Apologize to him first.

65
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,770
What are you waiting for?

66

74

Just go back and teach him.

174
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,760
and insisted on looking for He Chufeng.

175
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,760
Could she be He Chufeng's illegitimate daughter?

176
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,940
Yuan.

177
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,330
Let me finish.

178
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,710
Who is that?

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,000
She wants to learn how to unlock from He Chufeng.

180
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,370
She said her name is Big Force.

181
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,350
Big Force?

182
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,820
Is she a skinny girl

183
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,910
in school uniform

184
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,860
wearing a baseball cap?

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,620
Yes, that's her.

186
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,190
You mean Liu Xingyu.

187
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,060
Liu Xingyu?

188
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,180
Don't read my name.

189
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,740
It says Liu Xingyu.

190
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,850
She walks around every day.

191
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,020
She doesn't have to go to school?

192
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,470
Poor kid.

193
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,860
Her parents divorced.

194
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,060
She lived with her mother,

195
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,840
her uncle and aunt.

196
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,360
But her mother had cerebral thrombosis two years ago

197
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,170
and got hemiplegia.

198
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,890
She couldn't work anymore.

199
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,180
They can only live on low insurance.

200
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,500
But after she went to the middle school,

201
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,870
she stopped studying.

202
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,520
She said she wanted to find a job in the community.

203
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,700
She's a minor.

204
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,140
How can she get a job to earn money?

205
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,510
Let's go. We'll be late.

206
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,400
I told you I can give you money.

207
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,820
That's not your money.

208
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,350
Not last time.

209
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,980
It is this time.

210
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,640
At your age,

211
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,170
shouldn't you be studying in school?

212
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,220
Studying is useless.

213
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,950
I want to learn how to unlock from him.

214
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,320
Although not all social talents

215
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,540
are from school,

216
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,650
if you study hard,

217
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,090
you'll have a higher chance of success.

218
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,700
I want to learn how to unlock from you.

219
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,900
Just tell me if you'll agree.

220
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,710
Did I do something wrong?

221
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,410
If you didn't do anything wrong,

222
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,010
why were you in the police station last night?

223
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,680
You kidnapped me to go there.

224
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,990
Why did we do that?

225
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,370
How would I know?

226
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,020
Think about it.

227
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,260
What did you do last night?

228
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,560
Does entering the police station mean I was wrong?

229
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,620
Didn't you go too?

230
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,460
You're quibbling and being a rogue.

231
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,340
Tell me.

232
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,490
What did I do wrong?

233
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,740
Tell me why you want to learn.

234
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,490
Just tell me if you'll agree.

235
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,700
I won't accept you.

236
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,510
Leave.

237
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,060
If you don't accept me,

238
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,140
I won't leave.

239
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,500
A master takes in pupils

240
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,490
is predestined.

241
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,710
He Chufeng must have his reasons

242
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,650
for not accepting you.

243
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,280
Besides,

244
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,680
there are so many locksmiths outside.

245
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,440
Find someone else.

246
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,100
He's different from others.

247
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,100
Why?

248
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,980
I just took a lock from you.

249
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,740
Why won't you let it go?

250
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,030
Took it?

251
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,420
Do you know the difference between taking and stealing?

252
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,150
That's because he ignored me.

253
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,070
I thought of a way to make him pay attention to me.

254
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,590
The way you attract someone's attention

255
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,580
is quite special.

256
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,300
I came here that day

257
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,840
to return it.

258
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,260
I didn't expect to be caught by you.

259
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,650
Leave.

260
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,270
Is it because I'm a girl?

261
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,020
First, you need to think carefully

262
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,790
why you want to learn how to unlock.

263
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,420
Second,

264
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,700
you still don't know

265
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,750
what you did wrong.

266
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,640
Last,

267
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,010
whether I accept you or not

268
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,660
has nothing to do with your gender.

269
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,460
Listen to him.

270
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,210
Go back and think about these three questions.

271
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
If you don't accept me,

272
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,660
I wish you won't have a customer for three months.

273
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,570
This kid is quite tough.

274
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,030
Why do you unlock?

275
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,910
[2011]

276
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,060
Because the moment I opened it feels good.

277
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:46,760
Come on.

278
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,750
Try it.

279
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,340
I haven't done it before.

280
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,410
That's why you should try it.

281
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,790
I'll count the time for you.

282
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,940
Eight minutes.

283
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,500
I'm done eating.

284
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,780
Are you unlocking it

285
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,350
by guessing the code?

286
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,380
How long will it take?

287
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,650
Feel it.

288
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,160
Twenty minutes.

289
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,660
It took you so much time.

290
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,290
How did you do it?

291
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,220
Practice.

292
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,420
Come in.

293
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,390
Sui Yi.

294
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,200
Did you see the gift on the desk?

295
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,410
It's from Mr. Jin.

296
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,310
Mr. Jin gave it to me?

297
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,220
He found out that you worked hard

298
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,060
for One & Only.

299
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,180
He was happy,

300
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,520
so he prepared a gift.

301
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,420
It's okay.

302
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,720
It's not a big deal.

303
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,380
Please accept

304
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,340
Mr. Jin's kindness.

305
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,420
I have some too.

306
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,050
Don't feel burdened.

307
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,160
[Robin It looks normal. It's not worth much.]

308
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,500
Great!

309
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,130
Otherwise, the meeting in the afternoon won't be held.

310
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,840
Thank you.

311
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,690
You're welcome.

312
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,050
This way, please.

313
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,770
[Sui Yi]

314
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,770
[I'm relieved. Thank you.]

315
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,010
[It's nothing. You're off work?]

316
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,920
[Yes. I'll be back after sorting out the files.]

317
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:41,680
[Okay, I'll wait for you at the shop.]

318
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,130
Mr. He.

319
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,750
Mr. He.

320
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,030
This way, please.

321
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,020
Let me take a look.

322
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,260
This is just an ordinary folding fan.

323
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,860
This is expensive.

324
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,190
Didn't you say it's worthless?

325
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,300
What happened to your hand?

326
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,780
It's a man's scar.

327
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,440
I'm back.

328
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,280
Don't interrupt.

329
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,880
I mean this fan pendant.

330
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,010
This fan pendant is very valuable.

331
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,580
This is agarwood.

332
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,430
Is it the agarwood I know?

333
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,950
I don't know which one you know.

334
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,580
What if you know

335
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,290
the Chen Xiang in Lotus Lantern.

336
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,780
Stop joking.

337
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:51,740
All right.

338
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,260
Let me tell you.

339
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,610
High-class agarwood

340
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,920
is glowing.

341
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,210
The grease line is delicate and dense.

342
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,530
Besides,

343
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,530
its smell will be more mellow and elegant.

344
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,820
You can smell it for a long time without being bored.

345
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,150
And its smell

346
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,140
will change as seasons change.

347
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,220
Smell it.

348
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,530
What's the difference between these two?

349
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,070
This one has stronger smell indeed.

350
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,890
Of course.

351
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,340
You're back.

352
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,580
The real agarwood...

353
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,210
Hello.

354
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,050
The real agarwood

355
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,790
has a layer of fine grease on the surface.

356
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,710
The better the quality,

357
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,070
the more it secretes.

358
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,580
The touch will be smooth.

359
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,320
This is not bad.

360
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,360
Not bad.

361
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,300
Sui Yi.

362
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,470
You have high standards.

363
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,470
This is Qinan agarwood.

364
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,780
What is Qinan agarwood?

365
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,500
Qinan agarwood

366
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,200
is a kind of top agarwood.

367
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,820
Its grease secretion

368
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,930
is more

369
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,580
than that of other agarwood.

370
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,080
And the touch

371
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,570
won't feel sticky.

372
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,770
It's very rare in the market.

373
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:11,990
Well,

374
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,710
how much is it?

375
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,630
This should be

376
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,560
submerged grade white Qinan from Nha Trang, Vietnam.

377
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:24,800
That's right.

378
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,230
It's the top grade in Qinan.

379
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,900
Let me take a look at its sculpture.

380
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,280
The carving is delicate.

381
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,430
Very good.

382
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,200
It should be between 6 to 6.5 grams.

383
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,140
About 150,000 yuan.

384
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,100
How much?

385
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,570
Don't be surprised.

386
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,320
I haven't finished yet.

387
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,130
Look.

388
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,030
This top-quality shredded fan bag.

389
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,660
These two together

390
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,660
amount to at least 160,000 yuan.

391
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,930
160,000 yuan?

392
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,190
At least.

393
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,490
But I don't understand.

394
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Why is such a good fan pendant

395
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,400
-hung on this folding fan? -Why is it so expensive?

396
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,180
Why did he give me something so expensive?

397
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,150
What happened?

398
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,320
Who gave it to you?

399
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,050
Ms. Su said

400
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,220
I did a good job.

401
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,000
A gift from a client.

402
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,110
Although Mr. Jin is a layman,

403
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,490
he's generous.

404
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,740
You have to treat such clients well.

405
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,300
Understand?

406
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,540
You guys talk.

407
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,320
I'll stay over there.

408
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,040
I need to tell Ms. Su.

409
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,720
Why did she run away as soon as she saw me recently?

410
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,810
How would I know what you did?

411
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,980
What if Ms.  Su doesn't want to return it?

412
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,420
160,000 yuan.

413
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,580
Could it be that the gift to you

414
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,490
was given to your boss

415
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,890
and the gift to your boss was given to you?

416
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,820
Maybe.

417
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,120
Right?

418
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,930
What should I do?

419
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,850
How should I tell Ms. Su?

420
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,330
Do you need any help?

421
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,530
No, no.

422
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,820
You can ask me.

423
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,650
I won't ask you.

424
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,020
Then why did you ask him?

425
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,810
Why didn't you ask me?

426
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,050
I won't ask him.

427
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,020
I won't ask you either.

428
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,530
I'll think about it upstairs later.

429
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,840
You have to ask.

430
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,910
If you ask me,

431
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,760
I can think of ways to help you.

432
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,210
I told you, I...

433
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,930
Are you asking me or not?

434
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,540
What should I ask?

435
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,050
She means

436
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,770
whether she should return it to her boss.

437
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,500
How should she tell her boss

438
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,340
so that her boss won't feel embarrassed?

439
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,120
Since you've decided

440
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,940
it's inappropriate to accept this gift,

441
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,770
send it back

442
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,250
and express your thoughts sincerely.

443
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,160
Why are you two blushing?

444
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,150
Do you have a fever?

445
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,660
Why isn't summer over yet?

446
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,390
I'll go upstairs and get changed.

447
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,090
No.

448
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:21,810
She...

449
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,340
I'll get changed too.

450
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,680
Is it so hot?

451
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,820
I even wore a vest today.

452
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,190
Am I crazy?

453
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,220
Why did you leave the box behind today?

454
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,880
Is this a love letter?

455
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,820
People still write to you these days.

456
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,180
It must be very sentimental.

457
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:16,920
Do you want it?

458
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,140
I'll write one to you too.

459
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,990
Sure.

460
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Write me a poem.

461
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,040
I'll set it up

462
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,780
and show it to my descendants.

463
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,610
I'm leaving.

464
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,780
How is it?

465
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,210
Is it okay here?

466
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,900
It used to be a maintenance ship,

467
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,040
but it was abandoned.

468
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,010
No one will come.

469
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,120
By the way,

470
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:18,850
I put a lot of effort

471
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,870
to get this for you.

472
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:21,830
Bro.

473
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:22,690
Look.

474
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,000
Thank you.

475
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:28,900
Thank you.

476
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,290
If you need anything,

477
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,050
just let me know.

478
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,490
I know this place.

479
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,810
But

480
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,750
why do you want it

481
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,180
since it can't be opened?

482
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,540
To hide people.

483
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,180
I'm just kidding.

484
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,420
I can't even open it. How can I hide people?

485
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,580
Just for decoration.

486
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,140
OK.

487
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,820
I'm leaving.

488
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,900
Go ahead.

489
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,270
Ms. Su.

490
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,090
Come in.

491
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,730
Ms. Su,

492
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,260
my friend told me

493
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,050
it seems valuable.

494
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,350
Is it inappropriate for us to accept it?

495
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,330
It's not appropriate.

496
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,360
I'll contact Mr. Jin.

497
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,690
If it's convenient,

498
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,420
please return them for me.

499
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,240
Okay.

500
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,350
Thank you, Ms. Su.

501
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,420
I've told Ms. Su.

502
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,060
But she wasn't angry

503
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,910
or awkward.

504
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,740
I'll return the gift

505
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,710
this weekend to Mr. Jin.

506
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,620
Thank you.

507
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,060
♫Making noise alone and messing around alone. It's also good to be alone♫

508
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,920
♫Then let imagination control all my confusion♫

509
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,950
♫I pretend that I'm not that sensitive♫

510
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,670
♫And I hate that I'm not brave enough♫

511
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,560
He Chufeng.

512
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,640
♫I chose to run away cleverly every time♫

513
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:16,080
♫My heart broke into pieces, and no one wanted to pick them up♫

514
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:24,240
♫It was like the speed of a planet falling to the earth, which was so surprising♫

515
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,860
Let's go home together.

516
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:31,550
♫Maybe you won't show up on the day which I'm looking forward to♫

517
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:38,120
♫I have to wait patiently for the shadows to go far away♫

518
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,510
Thanks to you.

519
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,910
Ms. Su thanked me today.

520
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,260
You're right.

521
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,960
I did care too much before,

522
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,020
so I didn't dare to say my thoughts.

523
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,130
But if I don't,

524
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,970
I'll misunderstand more things.

525
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,800
Also,

526
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,250
thank you.

527
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,180
For what?

528
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,300
Thank you for curing my hiccups.

529
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,200
Actually, I didn't expect it would work.

530
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,180
What's your plan later?

531
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,340
Nothing.

532
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,410
Then don't go back.

533
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,030
Let's go.

534
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,650
Let's go.

535
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,660
Hello, welcome.

536
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:40,010
♫Crying and smiling, I turn around and give myself a hug♫

537
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,580
Do you need anything?

538
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,780
What do you want to eat?

539
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,180
Forget it.

540
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,860
♫Take it as a cold called fragility♫

541
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,720
What do you want to eat? I'll buy it for you.

542
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
You probably forgot.

543
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,320
I still owe you money.

544
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,330
What do you want to eat? I'll buy it for you.

545
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,870
♫I resent the people who left me for going too fast♫

546
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,210
Okay, I'll take this.

547
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,270
♫I can't help but slow down♫

548
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,640
Do you want this?

549
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,090
I'll take it out for you.

550
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:57,970
What does Robin want to eat?

551
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,930
I'll buy it together.

552
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,580
♫I don't want to admit that everyone is an isolated island♫

553
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,420
No need.

554
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,660
Just buy for me.

555
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,420
Don't worry about him.

556
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,580
It's okay.

557
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,410
I can buy it together.

558
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:03,870
No.

559
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,900
It's enough to buy for me.

560
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,190
♫My heart broke into pieces, and no one wanted to pick them up♫

561

OK.

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,050
Check please.

563
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:20,360
♫It was like the speed of a planet falling to the earth, which was so surprising♫

564
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,550
I'll scan your QR code.

565
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,940
It's done. Thank you.

566
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:19,940
Anything else?

567
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,010
These three.

568
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:27,660
♫Maybe you won't show up on the day which I'm looking forward to♫

569
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,330
One of each kind.

570
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:22,880
OK.

571
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:34,240
♫I have to wait patiently for the shadows to go far away♫

572

573
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,030
No.

574
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,740
I went to the place where I used to live.

575
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,630
In Zhaobei.

576
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:40,620
Zhaobei?

577
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:46,320
♫Ingratiation slowly erases my pride♫

578
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,310
I've never been there before.

579
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,240
It's not bad.

580
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,370
You used to live there?

581
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,050
♫I hate that I always force a smile♫

582
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,180
I lived there for several years.

583
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,060
♫I'm self-righteous to think that I'm insignificant♫

584
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,430
When did you move to the vintage shop?

585
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,320
About a year ago.

586
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,760
♫Ingratiation quietly smooths out my edge♫

587
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,110
What did Bean Bun look like

588
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,420
when you first came to the vintage shop?

589
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:07,580
♫Hide my rebellious and stubborn personality♫

590
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,470
It was slimmer back then.

00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,400
I really want to see

592
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:14,240
♫Protect those worthwhile and important things♫

593

00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,760
I'll send you the photos later.

595
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,650
Sure.

596
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,890
It's still early

597
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,000
and you bought a Christmas tree?

598
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,670
Yes, it's unique.

599
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,430
It's unexpected.

600
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,000
Please help me.

601
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,860
Didn't you buy one last year?

602
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,400
It's still in the warehouse.

603
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,740
There are many people this year.

604
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,570
Of course we need a big tree

605
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,380
to celebrate the New Year and the Spring Festival together.

606
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,500
By then,

607
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,460
all of you will pile gifts

608
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,370
under the Christmas tree.

609
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,980
This is the sense of ritual of life.

610
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,370
OK.

611
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,640
I'll definitely give you

612
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,020
the biggest gift box.

613
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,860
You're so sweet.

614
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,020
Who bought the dessert?

615
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,380
Why didn't you buy strawberry cake?

616
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,239
I bought it.

617
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,409
Give it to me if you don't want it.

618
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,400
Who said I don't want it?

619
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,340
I'll eat it later.

620
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,040
Last time I heard that

621
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,550
you met again after high school.

622
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,650
Yes.

623
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,219
I transferred to another school when I was in second grade.

624
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,360
I didn't know him well back then.

625
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,330
We haven't contacted for a long time.

626
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,900
We don't know each other now.

627
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,070
Then,

628
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,020
how did you meet each other again?

629
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,040
Reunion?

630
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,440
That's a good word.

631
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,070
I picked up Bean Bun that day.

632
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,650
I picked up He Chufeng.

633
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,430
He Chufeng?

634
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,140
Granny Mi.

635
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,950
I'm back.

636
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,400
Let me introduce someone to you.

637
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,400
You're back.

638
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,410
This is He Chufeng.

639
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,310
This is Granny Mi.

640
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,680
Hello, He Chufeng.

641
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,070
Hello.

642
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,400
Does your family still live in the city?

643
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,180
I don't have any family member left.

644
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,260
I'm alone now.

645
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,630
From now on,

646
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,090
take this place as your home.

647
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,090
Thank you.

648
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,460
Didn't you say

649
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,980
you want one more person to share the rent?

650
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,630
You live quite comfortably yourself.

651
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,260
It's perfect for both sides.

652
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,000
When I live alone,

653
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,450
it's more tranquil.

654
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,720
It is said that people would see their life script

655
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,090
when they reincarnate.

656
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,180
I must think

657
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,830
my script in this life is not bad.

658
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,560
So I came here.

659
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,780
Your part may not be well written

660
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,140
in my script.

661
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,370
In that case,

662
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,510
my script is quite attentive.

663
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,190
You should learn from Sui Yi.

664
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,890
She's so optimistic.

665
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,900
You have to see a beautiful side in everything.

666
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,570
Her part is pretty good.

667
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,460
But if you can't speak

668
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,200
in my script,

669
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,140
that'll be great.

670
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,460
You don't have to be so noisy.

671
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,620
If the three of us

672
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,710
don't talk,

673
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,600
it will become...

674
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,390
It's good.

675
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,810
Look, it's so quiet.

676
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,110
Your phone.

677
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:20,980
I'll answer it.

678
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,060
Hello?

679
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,750
Pretty Ms. Luo.

680
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,150
What can your handsome son do for you?

681
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,300
I heard

682
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,850
Robin's blind date

683
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,000
was arranged by his mother.

684
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,300
Maybe she wants him to have a family soon.

685
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,870
He must be close to his family.

686
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,370
[Monster Notebook]

687
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,270
Thank you.

688
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,690
It's getting colder.

689
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,890
Why did you drink iced coke?

690
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,530
I need to stay sober at any time.

691
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,640
I'm a police officer.

692
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,060
You should drink less of this non-nutritious stuff.

693
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,940
Here, drink this.

694
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,790
Migu juice tea.

695
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,760
Take in some VC.

696
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,740
Why do you want to be a policeman?

697
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,720
The police are so handsome.

698
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,510
Look at my uniform.

699
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,320
Am I handsome?

700
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,970
This outfit is cool.

701
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,520
So why did you become a police officer?

702
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,840
Once,

703
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,920
we went to the track and field team competition in the city.

704
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,300
It's around this intersection.

705
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,350
I saw a thief

706
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,950
was stealing a wallet.

707
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,450
I just clapped and shouted,

708
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,200
"What are you doing?"

709
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,310
Then the thief ran away.

710
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,370
I ran after him.

711
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,730
He ran fast.

712
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,880
I chased after him for several blocks,

713
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,390
but I still caught him.

714
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,890
I pressed him on the ground.

715
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,490
Awesome.

716
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,920
And then?

717
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,460
Then the police came.

718
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,300
So I returned the wallet.

719
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,570
What about your game?

720
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,770
I didn't make it in the end.

721
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,700
I was late.

722
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,510
But I don't regret it at all.

723
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,520
Because I saw the owner

724
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,660
told me

725
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,240
thank you.

726
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,640
So from that moment on,

727
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,760
I made up my mind

728
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,450
to become a policeman when I grow up.

729
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,910
I want to serve the people.

730
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,620
Great.

731
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,280
Big Force.

732
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,080
What about you?

733
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,490
What do you want to do when you grow up?

734
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,520
You want to be a locksmith?

735
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,390
I don't know.

736
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,100
Then why do you

737
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,770
learn how to unlock with He Chufeng?

738
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,390
Do you think locking is fun?

739
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,040
I want to protect my mom.

740
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,420
My mom is sick.

741
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,170
She can't get out of bed.

742
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,570
I remember one day when I went to school,

743
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,460
I forgot to bring my key.

744
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,820
I can't open the door after I go home.

745
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,860
If I can't go in,

746
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,520
my mom can't eat.

747
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,580
