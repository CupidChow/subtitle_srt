5
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,240
You finished working?

6
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,780
Didn't I tell you to go back first?

7
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,980
Why did you wait until now?

8
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,760
Because you asked me out.

9
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,430
I'm sorry.

10
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,250
The restaurant I booked

11
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,580
should be closed.

12
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,730
So I should book the restaurant.

13
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,480
Let's go.

14
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,400
What a nice festival.

15
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,460
What a great atmosphere.

16
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,940
What were you going to do today?

17
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,020
I wanted to have dinner with you.

18
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,960
What else

19
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,800
besides eating?

20
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,890
At this hour,

21
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,870
what can we do besides eating?

22
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,630
What else do you want to do?

23
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,940
I want...

24
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,399
I didn't...

25
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,660
Nothing.

26
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,430
I'm just muddled by working overtime.

27
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,420
I booked a restaurant

28
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,820
with a great atmosphere.

29
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,320
But if we go now, we'll have to queue up for a long time.

30
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,409
You've been standing for so long today.

31
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't want you to stand for too long.

32
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,770
There's nothing left anyway.

33
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,650
Forget it.

34
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
Do you like me?

35
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,710
Yes.

36
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,480
Look over there.

37
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,430
♫The breeze is brushing my weary face♫

38
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,680
♫Looking at the stars, under the moonlight♫

39
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,460
♫Suddenly I have too many thoughts♫

40
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,200
♫It's almost midnight♫

41
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,440
Why all of a sudden?

42
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,810
♫I can't sleep at all♫

43
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,770
I wasn't ready yet.

44
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,260
What else do you need to be ready?

45
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,320
♫Hey, it's all right. No more sighing♫

46
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,860
I was going to...

47
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,270
♫The clouds will be gone when the sun comes up♫

48
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,740
Let's have dinner first.

49
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,260
The restaurant I booked has a band performance.

50
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,900
Before the band performance ends,

51
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,060
I'll give you the present

52
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,510
♫The Milky Way is endless. Take a deep breath♫

53
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,820
I prepared.

54
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,840
Then we go to the cinema together.

55
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,070
I booked two movie tickets.

56
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,730
♫One planet is so far away from another♫

57
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,140
It's a really good love movie.

58
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,860
Then we go to

59
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,380
the city rooftop to watch the night view.

60
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,380
And under the night view, I will...

61
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,970
♫Why are we so childish?♫

62
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,280
What will you do?

63
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,200
I...

64
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,470
♫I folded the answer in the paper plane♫

65
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,980
Don't worry.

66
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,220
If things don't go well,

67
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll walk back on my own.

68
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,440
If everything goes well, I will...

69
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,540
♫Acting like I don't care♫

70
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,830
What?

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,420
♫I've got many secrets♫

72
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,300
Let's talk about it later.

73
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,710
Do you want to do it again?

74
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,060
Okay.

75
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,380
♫I want to lie under the moonlight with you♫

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,790
Are you hungry?

77
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,340
It's okay.

78
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,880
♫The light wind and clouds are like your breath♫

79
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,840
Just eat later.

80
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,900
♫I want to melt into the dreams with you♫

81
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,400
♫And listen to our heartbeats that are in sync♫

82
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,409
♫The rush of happiness comes so suddenly♫

83
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,010
Let's go.

84
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,900
Fill your stomach first.

85
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,520
♫Every look of yours will move me♫

86
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:01,900
-Let's go. -Okay.

87
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,760
♫Your gentle eyes are intoxicating♫

88
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,320
Let's go.

89
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:07,710
Let's go.

90
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,500
♫I've fell for you, without knowing it♫

91
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,640
♫My heart is beating wildly♫

92
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,380
What should we eat?

93
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,390
Guess.

94
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,440
When can I fall in love?

95
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,190
Bean bun.

96
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,600
Look at your brother, He Chufeng.

97
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,810
He's not as cold as before.

98
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,460
He's not as quiet as before.

99
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,980
He's not the same as before.

100
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,670
At times like this,

101
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,140
we can't go out.

102
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,400
We can't go anywhere.

103
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,659
Anyway, sweet love

104
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,840
will not fall on me.

105
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,390
Right?

106
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
They're back already?

107
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,650
Can you

108
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,090
identify me?

109
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
Don't call the police.

110
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,880
So you're now my boyfriend

111
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,420
and I'm your girlfriend.

112
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,180
Right?

113
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,900
Are you going back on your word?

114
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,340
No.

115
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,550
I was just checking.

116
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,340
I think for the sake of our future relationship,

117
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,620
I think it's better

118
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,520
for us to make something clear

119
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,340
in advance.

120
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,070
OK. Go ahead.

121
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,430
I, Sui Yi,

122
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,740
have no other relationship

123
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,370
after meeting you

124
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,200
or marriage history.

125
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,350
So don't worry.

126
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,300
There won't be any emotional disputes.

127
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,370
What about you?

128
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,360
Really?

129
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,320
Then what about Zheng Xingchuan?

130
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,080
Zheng Xingchuan?

131
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,460
Do you think he likes me?

132
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,820
Don't worry.

133
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,120
It's impossible.

134
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,190
As for those flowers and bears,

135
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,040
they are all objective factors.

136
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,180
They don't exist anymore.

137
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,460
So don't worry.

138
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:52,870
I won't

139
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,270
allow them to show up again.

140
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:55,900
Alright.

141
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,670
As for me,

142
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,080
I don't have any marriage history or emotional disputes.

143
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,870
You can date me without worries.

144
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,660
The police station has a file.

145
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
If you want to see it,

146
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,660
you can check it out yourself.

147
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,500
Okay.

148
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,910
The first thing I want to do

149
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,960
after I finish internship is to check your file.

150
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,490
Do you have any more questions,

151
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,050
Counselor Sui?

152
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,770
Not for now.

153
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,350
You can't go back on your word anyway.

154
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,540
The verbal agreement has legal effect.

155
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,700
The CCTV on the road just caught it.

156
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,350
I have evidence.

157
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,350
You were in the mood

158
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,430
to observe the surroundings?

159
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,940
I passed by there every day when I went to work.

160
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,120
I've observed it for a long time.

161
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,020
But today was an accident.

162
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,240
I didn't expect it to be there.

163
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,580
I didn't expect our first meal after confirming relationships

164
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,620
was barbecue.

165
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,160
How about we go somewhere else?

166
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,430
No need.

167
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,690
Barbecue is good.

168
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,340
It's unexpected,

169
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,220
but it's also very special.

170
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,240
It should be delicious.

171
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,530
Granny, you're here.

172
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,010
This...

173
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,220
This girl fainted in front of the store just now.

174
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,340
She said something before she fainted.

175
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,390
"Can you identify me?"

176
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,300
And "Don't call the police."

177
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,170
I really...

178
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,100
I didn't do it.

179
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,920
Let me see.

180
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,560
Granny, what are you doing?

181
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,020
We can't destroy evidence of crime.

182
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,230
Look.

183
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,150
This is not real blood.

184
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,150
It's not blood.

185
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,340
This is ketchup.

186
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,880
What's wrong with me?

187
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,020
Are these

188
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,220
all ketchup?

189
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,660
They look alike.

190
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,380
But she has abrasions

191
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,180
on her hand.

192
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,410
They should be cured tomorrow.

193
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,040
She is

194
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,210
asleep.

195
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,260
Granny.

196
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,690
Why aren't you surprised at all?

197
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,700
Because back then,

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,900
Grandpa Mi

199
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,760
just fell in front of me like this.

200
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,300
This is how your

201
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,660
legendary romance started?

202
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,680
You can say that.

203
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,730
You're back.

204
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,050
Granny Mi.

205
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,010
You're here too.

206
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,430
Why are you back?

207
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,550
Can't they come back?

208
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,940
They...

209
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,110
went out

210
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,380
to...

211
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,120
Who is this?

212
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,440
Robin.

213
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,700
This is your?

214
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,940
I don't know her.

215
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,910
Why do you bring her home if you don't know her?

216
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,020
You're so fast.

217
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,880
Stop.

218
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,160
You two...

219
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,490
It's not what you think.

220
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,820
Then what are we thinking?

221
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,460
Hello?

222
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,030
Granny.

223
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,380
Is it really okay if we don't call the police?

224
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,980
When she wakes up tomorrow morning,

225
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,200
everything will be clear.

226
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,410
I see.

227
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,420
I understand.

228
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,860
Song asked her to come...

229
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,600
Song asked her to come to me.

230
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,820
Song said she doesn't remember who she is.

231
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,730
She must be an acquaintance.

232
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,100
No problem then.

233
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,970
Rest early.

234
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,740
Granny.

235
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,570
You just left?

236
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,420
She said she doesn't remember herself.

237
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,970
Are you so relieved?

238
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,320
I have seen all kinds of scenes.

239
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,100
When she wakes up tomorrow morning,

240
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,410
everything will be clear.

241
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,910
This is a Christmas gift for you.

242
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,860
Thank you, Granny.

243
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,020
I'll get going.

244
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,340
It's up to you.

245
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,390
Bye.

246
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,070
Grandma is much more generous than us.

247
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,960
Sui Yi, learn from her.

248
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,160
She said she doesn't remember who she is.

249
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,150
Did she lose her memory?

250
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,620
At the beginning,

251
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,280
she asked me if I could identify her.

252
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,250
Then she fell down.

253
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,700
When she fell down,

254
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,380
she said

255
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:44,940
do not call the police.

256
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,450
When did you become so obedient?

257
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,090
You were not here.

258
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,900
What can I do?

259
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
She was lying...

260
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,410
Lying in my arms.

261
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,820
That's the point.

262
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,690
You stretched the word "lying" on purpose.

263
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,720
Don't expose me,

264
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,930
then we are still good friends.

265
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,230
Do you think I don't know

266
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,410
what you did out there?

267
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,740
I didn't say anything.

268
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,710
When did you start working as a human appraiser?

269
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,510
Do you have a certificate?

270
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,180
Don't change the subject.

271
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm just an appraiser.

272
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,020
An object appraisal.

273
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,460
Who said that

274
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,470
I can appraise people?

275
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,580
Maybe it's Wang Wenxni.

276
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,280
Maybe.

277
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,630
Such an alien.

278
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,300
Fine.

279
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
I'll specially identify people from now on.

280
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,690
Help me check

281
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,030
where I can get a certificate.

282
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,410
I'll check it for you now.

283
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,000
Sui Yi.

284
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,510
Why do I think it's you?

285
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,930
Did you tell Chen Xiaoyuan?

286
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,720
No, I'm not that kind...

287
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,920
Of...

288
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,250
What about her?

289
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,990
She can't sleep on the sofa all night.

290
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,240
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

291
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,160
No.

292
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,980
Why not?

293
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,360
No reason.

294
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,060
Where should I sleep?

295
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,060
The sofa.

296
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,940
Wait.

297
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,240
Let's vote.

298
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,550
For what?

299
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,160
Raise your hand if you agree

300
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,420
me to sleep in He Chufeng's room.

301
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,180
Aren't you afraid that I'll freeze to death?

302
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,849
I knew you still love me.

303
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,870
He Chufeng.

304
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,070
Is there anything I can steal from you?

305
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,450
I can't sleep tonight.

306
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,220
Should I change my alias?

307
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,720
Forget it.

308
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,390
What if someone sees us?

309
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,860
Then...

310
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:19,540
[He Chufeng, set as a star mark friend]

311
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,760
How about this?

312
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,490
Forget it.

313
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,530
Stop thinking about it.

314
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,070
Go to bed.

315
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,250
You have to work tomorrow.

316
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:22,560
[Are you asleep?]

317
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,220
I said so much during the day.

318
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,590
Forget it.

319
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,470
[Sui Yi withdrew a message.]

320
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,970
[I saw it.]

321
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,820
I shouldn't have done that.

322
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,010
You already sent it.

323
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,910
Why do you take it back?

324
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,710
It's obvious that you feel embarrassed.

325
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,030
It's only been a few hours.

326
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,550
I just acted so proactive.

327
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,160
Should I be more reserved?

328
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:03,930
[I can't sleep either.]

329

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,740
♫Ingratiation quietly smooths out my edge♫

343
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,330
Did he leave?

344
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,590
I don't know.

345
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,560
♫Hide my rebellious and stubborn personality♫

346

♫Protect those worthwhile and important things♫

347
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,450
He must have left.

348
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,200
Why are you here?

349
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,400
I just want to say good night to you.

350
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,140
♫Crying and smiling, I turn around and give myself a hug♫

351

♫Take it as a cold called fragility♫

352
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,130
Good night.

353
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,020
See you tomorrow.

354
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,770
Okay.

355
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:52,920
See you tomorrow.

356
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,000
♫I resent the people who left me for going too fast♫

357
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,400
♫I can't help but slow down♫

358
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,720
♫I don't want to admit that everyone is an isolated island♫

359
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:16,330
♫My heart broke into pieces, and no one wanted to pick them up♫

360
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:24,490
♫It was like the speed of a planet falling to the earth, which was so surprising♫

361
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,790
♫Maybe you won't show up on the day which I'm looking forward to♫

362
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,370

364
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:56,180
♫I hate that I always force a smile♫

365
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,200
♫I'm self-righteous to think that I'm insignificant♫

366
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,790

370
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,460
What are you doing?

371
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,580
Making breakfast.

372
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,170
How many lettuce do you want?

373
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,750
Two pieces.

374
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,230
How many eggs did you use?

375
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:17,870
Morning.

376
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,590
Why are you so early?

377
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,320
Did my alarm break?

378
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,700
Am I late?

379
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,430
Your watch is fine.

380
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,500
He's the one with the problem.

381
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,590
Please be grateful

382
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,370
for the angel's reward.

383
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
What is he saying?

384
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,520
Cherish the man who makes you breakfast.

385
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,490
I always cherish him.

386
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,630
But I cherish my life too.

387
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,030
Don't expose me,

388
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,260
then we are still good friends.

389
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,310
I'm talking about me.

390
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,000
You...

391
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,720
Is this really edible?

392
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,410
It's not just two pieces of bread

393
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,930
with a piece of meat and lettuce

394
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,790
and eggs.

395
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,210
It contains precious love and friendship.

396
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,040
Plus, I rarely get up early

397
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,300
to work.

398
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,610
The value of this sandwich

399
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,490
is far more valuable than the ingredients itself.

400
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,430
Please transfer the money voluntarily later.

401
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,440
A price

402
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,040
is worthy of your conscience.

403
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,550
I can skip it.

404
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,110
Because I have no money.

405
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,050
That's not what I meant.

406
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,120
You're awake.

407
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,020
A lady asked me to come here.

408
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,130
Yes.

409
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,160
You suddenly fainted yesterday.

410
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,720
Do you remember me?

411
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,780
You fainted in front of me yesterday

412
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,220
and slept in my room.

413
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,100
But don't worry.

414
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,300
I slept on the sofa.

415
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,820
Really?

416
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,650
I'm sorry

417
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,970
for causing you trouble.

418
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,500
Not at all.

419
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,840
What's your name?

420
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,940
What's my name?

421
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,100
I don't know.

422
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,450
I really don't know.

423
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,230
It's okay. There's no rush.

424
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,430
Go wash up

425
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,640
and come over for breakfast.

426
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,720
Take your time.

427
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,690
Let me help you.

428
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,600
The bathroom...

429
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,280
Here.

430
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,650
The bathroom is over there.

431
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,460
I've prepared

432
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,860
a set of toiletries for you inside.

433
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,360
You'll see when you get in.

434
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,330
A pink set.

435
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,680
If you need anything,

436
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,400
just tell me.

437
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,080
How did you sleep?

438
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,300
Not bad.

439
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,040
Eat.

440
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,300
Hasn't she finished yet?

441
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,540
Eat.

442
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,210
When are you going to send her away?

443
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:49,990
No.

444
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,650
She's all alone.

445
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,610
We need to help her.

446
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,690
Do you know her?

447
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:55,850
No.

448
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,380
So you want to let a stranger

449
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,210
stay?

450
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,210
We can slowly get to know her.

451
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,190
We don't even know who she is.

452
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,300
Is it a little...

453
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:04,860
What do you mean?

454
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,600
What time is it?

455
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,380
Why aren't you going to work?

456
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,270
Hurry up. Eat.

457
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,680
You're right.

458
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm worried about you all by myself.

459
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,800
Take the sandwich.

460
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,010
No, no, no.

461
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,900
No need.

462
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,450
Sandwich.

463
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,300
No, thanks.

464
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,590
Eat up.

465
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,210
-Really, the sandwiches are good. -If there's anything I can do,

466
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,140
let's talk about it in WeChat group.

467
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,720
What you can do now is to go to work

468
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,580
and bring the sandwiches.

469
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,510
Eat it.

470
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,780
Why isn't she here yet?

471
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,900
[Are you going to help the community today?]

472
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:52,050
[Yes.]

473
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,760
[I'm going to class in the afternoon. I'll pick you up after I finish.]

474
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,340
[Sure.]

475
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,920
You're here.

476
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,390
Come, have breakfast.

477
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,100
Would you like something to drink?

478
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,380
Coffee, milk or tea?

479
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,150
Milk.

480
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:31,860
Add some sugar?

481
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,120
A little.

482
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,600
Done.

483
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,540
Okay.

484
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,180
Thank you.

485
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,780
Can I ask you a few questions?

486
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,890
What else do you remember?

487
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,690
I only remember

488
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,730
I fell from a place.

489
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,880
Where?

490
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,940
Inside or outside?

491
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:12,889
Does it have any characteristics?

492
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:21,960
I don't remember.

493
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,449
How did you meet Song?

494
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,190
The one

495
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,920
who asked you to come here.

496
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,320
I don't know how I met her.

497
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,949
I only remember that she took me to this neighborhood

498
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,170
and directed me here.

499
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,730
She said there was an appraiser

500
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,710
who can identify people

501
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,260
without knowing anything.

502
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,949
So,

503
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,060
who is the appraisor?

504
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,679
Me.

505
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,659
Although I am an appraisor

506
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,820
who only identifies items.

507
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,050
Normally, I don't identify people.

508
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,310
But theoretically, I can do it.

509
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,650
Do you have anything else on you?

510
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,700

511
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,290
Austrian gas lighter.

512
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,370
Do you smoke?

513
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,790
I don't remember.

514
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,000
Then why

515
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,450
do I have this lighter on me?

516
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,010
Can you identify it for me?

517
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,820
For now, I can only identify

518
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,140
the brand and model of this lighter.

519
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,450
I'm not able to identify

520
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,020
other things.

521
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
That lady said

522
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,180
you can even identify

523
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,780
a person.

524
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:36,990
I...

525
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,780
I promise you

526
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,270
he is an excellent appraisor.

527
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,280
But based on your current situation,

528
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,210
you should go to the police station.

529
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,790
You may have all the answers you want.

530
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,780
I can't call the police.

531
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,110
Why?

532
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,620
If you don't tell us the truth,

533
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,010
we can reasonably suspect

534
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,780
you are a criminal,

535
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,760
a psycho.

536
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,830
or you have other purposes and intentions.

537
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,000
It's not that serious.

538
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,330
Whether you really lost your memory or not,

539
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,660
you should go to the hospital and the police station.

540
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,810
In our place,

541
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,990
you won't get any answer.

542
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,490
I really didn't lie to you.

543
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,470
I really don't remember who I am.

544
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,100
Even if you don't remember who you are,

545
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,020
you should at least remember some sounds

546
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:21,930
or the images.

547
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,070
Also,

548
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,740
why can't you call the police?

549
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,540
I don't know

550
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,540
why I can't call the police.

551
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,740
In my mind,

552
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,160
there's a voice telling me

553
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,740
that I can't call the police.

554
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,130
But I don't know who this voice is.

555
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Maybe it's me.

556
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,890
I don't know why.

557
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,850
So when I met that lady

558
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,140
and you,

559
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,570
in my mind,

560
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,180
the phrase keeps repeating itself.

561
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,320
So I believe my instinct.

562
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,060
If you think it's troublesome,

563
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,450
I can leave.

564
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,300
Thank you.

565
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,180
No, no, no.

566
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,670
You can't leave.

567
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,420
I mean

568
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,060
it's too dangerous for you to leave now.

569
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,540
What else can you remember?

570
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,390
I don't know if it's real

571
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,370
or in my dream,

572
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,940
there is someone who is always close to me.

573
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,100
But I can't see his face clearly.

574
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,400
He scares me.

575
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,340
Look, you're scared.

576
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,530
You can't go out. It's too dangerous outside.

577
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,400
You stay here.

578
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,200
It's safe here.

579
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,510
I'll protect you.

580
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,190
Hello, Officer Jia.

581
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,590
She's a little resistant.

582
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,160
Could you

583
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,500
change another way?

584
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,290
Don't mind

585
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,830
and don't worry.

586
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:05,860
For now,

587
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,370
he's doing the best.

588
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,930
Don't worry.

589
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,120
I promise you with my character

590
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,410
nothing will happen to you.

591
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,900
What if I'm really a criminal

592
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,590
or a psycho?

593
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,500
No.

594
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,140
By the way,

595
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,740
how about I give you a name?

596
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,450
What name do you want?

597
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:30,980
OK.

598
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:48,650
How is it?

599
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,670
Officer Jia will be here soon.

600
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,730
The most important thing now

601
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,490
is to keep an eye on her.

602
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,140
After all, her identity is unknown.

603
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,740
And we don't know

604
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,410
where she comes from.

605
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,530
When she

606
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,830
gets better,

607
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,610
you should take her to the hospital

608
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,360
and have a check.

609
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,850
Okay, I got it.

610
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,130
This is a special case.

611
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,860
Thank you.

612
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,620
Not at all.

613
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,010
Officer Chen told me

614
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,090
once the result is out,

615
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,260
I'll let you know immediately.

616
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:25,880
OK.

617
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:30,980
Mr. He.

618
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,170
This bear

619
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,550
is really cute.

620
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,520
Look.

621
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,460
It sets the atmosphere.

622
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,270
Right?

623
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,740
There's a small card here.

624
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,100
Is this your friend?

625
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,010
He's so handsome.

626
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,630
No.

627
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,820
He's extremely handsome.

628
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,690
Are all good-looking people

629
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,110
are willing to be together, right?

630
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,250
No.

631
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
What do you mean?

632
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,030
He is not my friend.

633
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,450
He must be Sui Yi's good friend.

634
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,150
Right?

635
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,590
So energetic.

636
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,630
Look at his uniform.

637
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,330
It's as fantastic as mine.

638
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,350
But I think mine...

639
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,690
Mr. He,

640
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,230
You don't look well.

641
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:30,630
No.

642
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,000
No.

643
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,720
I'll put it back for you.

644
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,500
It's all done?

645
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,700
Okay, we'll leave now.

646
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,600
OK.

647
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,020
By the way, Mr. He,

648
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,760
one more thing.

649
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,700
Has Big Force contacted you recently?

650
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,370
No.

651
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,190
Did something happen to her?

652
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,120
Nothing. I was just asking.

653
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,580
What's wrong with the bear?

654
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,510
Well...

655
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,120
It's sleepy.

656
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,320
Then go to sleep.

657
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:11,850
I'm leaving.

658
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,730
How is it?

659
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,820
I'm going to class.

660
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,040
Keep her company.

661
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,200
No problem.

662
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,280
[Monster Notebook]

663
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,110
Do you remember you helped me unlock my bicycle

664
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,140
when we were in high school?

665
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,170
I don't remember.

666
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,640
You don't remember?

667
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,790
We knew each other

668
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,430
because of the bicycle.

669
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,570
Do you remember this?

670
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,140
Yes.

671
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,900
You blocked my way.

672
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,830
Then we became classmates.

673
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,960
You didn't talk much at that time.

674
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,640
One time in PE class,

675
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,120
I lost the key.

676
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,380
After school,

677
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,860
I couldn't unlock the bicycle lock.

678
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,250
You opened it right away.

679
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,010
Did you forget this too?

680
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,210
I kind of remember.

681
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,420
I didn't expect you to be

682
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,580
