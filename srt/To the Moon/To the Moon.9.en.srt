the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

and backgrounds...)

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,220
(2,299.80 dollars)

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,290
Ji Song,
did you finish last month's reports?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
(Expense Report Summary)

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,500
Here you are.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,600
- And the approval forms?
- They're right here.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,500
I also verified the tax invoices.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,240
And the monthly closing reports...

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,210
have been updated on the server.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,050
Also, I've compiled a breakdown
of each team's expenses right here.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,920
Gosh. Ji Song, you're on fire today.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,890
I'm taking the afternoon off
to go pick up my boyfriend.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,590
What? Assistant Manager Oh
is off this afternoon too.

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,960
On a busy day, of all times.

18
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,170
Right.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,810
I can't just give up that easily.

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,950
Here we go.

21
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,670
Hi, there.
Are you here for new glasses?

22
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,770
- No, contacts.
- Contacts?

23
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,070
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

24
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,140
Thank you.

25
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,740
Taxi...

26
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,410
What?

27
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,550
Did he already land?

28
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,190
Hey!

29
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,130
Wait, what?
Why are you in your pajamas?

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,630
Sorry, Ji Song.

31
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,330
My mom is sick.
I had to cancel the trip.

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
So I can't go.

33
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,870
What? But I bought this scarf
for your mom.

34
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,710
But even if she couldn't come,
you should have come by yourself.

35
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,780
I don't have money.

36
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,540
I have no money.

37
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,180
Is it a fortune to fly here
from China?

38
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,280
You can't even afford
a plane ticket?

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,390
Actually, I bought new shoes.

40
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,420
What?

41
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,760
They're beautiful,
so they were a bit expensive.

42
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,190
- But...
- Sorry, Ji Song.

43
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,730
Let's just see each other
next time, okay?

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,340
Seriously? Am I in this relationship
by myself or something?

45
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,770
Why am I always the only one
putting in all the effort?

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,810
I know this is petty,

47
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,380
but how often have you visited Korea
while dating me?

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,610
To be blunt,
I love nice things more than you do.

49
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,950
But I have never once...

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,880
prioritized a stupid pair of shoes
over you.

51
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,550
Why am I always second to shoes?

52
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,320
Why am I always "next time?"

53
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,000
Tell me.

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,530
Do you even love me?

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
Sorry, Ji Song.

56
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,300
But I don't understand.

57
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,510
How can you not understand this?

58
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,280
Why can you never understand
what I'm saying?

59
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,490
Let's just end this.

60
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm exhausted too.

61
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,670
Are you okay?

62
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,570
- Oh, my.
- Excuse me?

63
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,910
My gosh!

64
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,080
Wait. Ji Song!

65
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,550
Gosh.

66
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,830
(Episode 9: The Turning Point)

67
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,330
What do you think? It's nice, right?

68
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,030
It's a singing style called scat.

69
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,710
It's a form of jazz singing that
started in the early 20th century.

70
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,050
I'm just making conversation.
I'm not trying to show off.

71
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,650
Louis Armstrong was the most famous
for that, wasn't he?

72
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,450
What's this?

73
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,320
I did
a little research online yesterday.

74
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,090
I am dating a musician, after all.

75
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,760
Gosh, what?

76
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,370
Hello, Mr. Ko.

77
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,400
- Da Hae?
- Just go.

78
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,240
Why are you acting like this?

79
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,110
- I'm a bit late.
- It's okay.

80
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,250
And here I was worried.

81
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580
Are you okay?

82
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,020
- Back when Eun Sang was ready to...
- Da Hee!

83
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,960
Where have you two been?

84
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,660
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

85
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,900
Gosh, that scared me.

86
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,040
We should've come here sooner.

87
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,880
This place is great, isn't it?

88
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,950
What's so amazing about a place
where you can't see a thing?

89
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,390
- I like it because we can't see.
- You mean you like not being seen.

90
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,690
What is this? It's a door!

91
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,730
Da Hae, I found the door!

92
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,960
Da Hae,
why aren't you saying anything?

93
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,130
Da Hae?

94
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,900
Da Hae? Why aren't you answering?

95
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Oh, my!

96
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,410
Oh, no.

97
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,480
Are you okay? Wait. I'm sorry.

98
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,910
You really scared me.

99
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,210
Let me see.

100
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
That was terrifying.

101
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,720
Thank you.

102
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,870
Come on, don't worry.
We're safe here.

103
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,440
- No one can see us.
- I know, but still.

104
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,410
What are you, a spy?

105
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,510
- What?
- It'd be easier to meet a real spy.

106
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,120
Why does our relationship have to be
such a huge secret?

107
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,450
Come on. Don't say that.
You know exactly why.

108
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,320
So, you don't like it?

109
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
Of course I...

110
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,500
It's my phone.

111
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,670
It's Ju Man.

112
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,370
(Byeon Ju Man)

113
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,540
I really hope you actually like me.

114
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,810
What?

115
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,680
- I'm always exhausted on Mondays.
- I know.

116
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,490
I just wish we could...

117
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,150
- Hey, look. Over there.
- What? What is it?

118
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,150
What...

119
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,240
When did we have
a wholesome, handsome guy...

120
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,570
working at our company?

121
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,410
Isn't that Mr. Oh from Accounting?

122
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,440
- What?
- What?

123
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,020
- Let's start the meeting.
- Okay.

124
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
Okay.

125
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,890
Ji Song,
could you get two coffees, please?

126
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,190
Coffee?

127
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,230
Yes. Our team's meeting is starting,
but the break room is out of coffee.

128
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,500
It should've been restocked,
but it's completely empty.

129
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,960
Just as I thought.

130
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
What?

131
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,270
Be it love or coffee beans.

132
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,640
I suppose
they all run out eventually.

133
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,540
Until there's nothing left.

134
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,480
Okay. Sure.

135
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,450
You don't have to go far.

136
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,080
Please get
two black coffees from the machine.

137
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,750
- Mr. Song doesn't take sugar.
- That's going to be very bitter.

138
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,990
What?

139
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,920
But you get used to it, I suppose.

140
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,830
It's tough at first, but over time,

141
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,530
the bitterness of coffee
and the bitterness of a breakup,

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,330
you get used to it all.

143
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,200
You just do.

144
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,470
Sure. I sure hope so.

145
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,440
Mr. Oh, would you like some coffee?

146
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,280
- I'll...
- I'll be right back!

147
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,220
A snack subscription service?

148
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,960
Yes. A curated box,
personalized to taste.

149
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,790
We're offering
more than just snacks.

150
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,300
We give them a tailored experience.

151
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,000
But isn't it a stretch to position
our snacks as high-end?

152
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,600
Not necessarily.

153
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,410
People don't buy expensive things
just for the product itself.

154
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,240
I recently had dinner at a place
in Gangnam called Eclat...

155
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,480
Eclat?

156
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,150
Isn't that a really famous place?

157
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,750
That place must be pretty expensive.

158
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,920
It was a little hard
to get a reservation.

159
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,450
Once I was there, it all made sense.

160
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,950
Everything from
how the table was set...

161
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,560
to the chef coming out
to explain the dishes.

162
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,090
It made me feel like
I wasn't just there to eat.

163
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,500
How should I put it? It made me feel
like I was someone special.

164
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,230
So you're saying the snack box...

165
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,300
can give consumers that same kind
of special feeling.

166
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,170
Exactly. The personalized snack box
isn't just about sending snacks.

167
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,710
It's about sending the customer
a message that they're special.

168
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,810
That's why the packaging
should also be special.

169
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,380
I was thinking,
what if we incorporated works of art?

170
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,020
I recently went to an exhibition
for an artist named Taylor Han.

171
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,090
Taylor Han?

172
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,590
I like that artist too.

173
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,690
No way!

174
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,430
You go to art exhibitions, Da Hae?

175
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,430
Why are you only asking me that
and not Da Hee?

176
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,940
Oh, I didn't mean anything by it.
I was just surprised, that's all.

177
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,210
Go ahead.

178
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,440
Nice work.

179
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,810
Good work, everyone.

180
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,280
Good work.

181
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,050
Hey, Da Hae.

182
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,620
You're on a roll lately.

183
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,290
- Thanks.
- Yes, for real.

184
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,960
That was a great idea today.

185
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,620
Good work!

186
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,460
Mr. Ko was totally blown away.

187
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,710
What's that?

188
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,050
It's nothing.

189
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,780
Da Hee, could I get
the Cocomishu proposal?

190
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,420
Sure.

191
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,590
(Jung Da Hae)

192
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,670
Hey, Eun Sang. What brings you here?

193
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,110
- The copier on our floor is broken.
- I see.

194
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,440
What? Is she broken too?

195
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,440
Gosh, she scared me!

196
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,710
What's she doing?

197
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,920
What are you doing?

198
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,390
Getting some coffee.

199
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,690
Two cups.

200
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,360
Two cups?

201
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,100
Looks more like 20 cups to me.

202
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,630
What?

203
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,140
What? When did all this...

204
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,440
What's with you guys?

205
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,780
Did you multiply or something?

206
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,580
For crying out loud.

207
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,510
Nurse Jung, handle this.

208
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,280
Yes, ma'am!

209
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,550
Ma'am?
I need you to look right here.

210
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,320
Look at these crypto gains, okay?

211
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,290
Our day has finally come.

212
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,930
- You can't lose it now.
- What?

213
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,530
It's going up!

214
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,930
I have to call Wei Lin...

215
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,040
No, wait.

216
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,000
I shouldn't do that, right?

217
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,940
I can't.

218
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,470
I can't.

219
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,810
I shouldn't do it.
Why would I make that call?

220
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,350
No, I can't. I shouldn't do it.

221
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,380
I shouldn't do it.

222
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,890
Hey!

223
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,590
You're going to fall!

224
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,890
She's completely lost it.

225
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,630
How long do you think
she'll be like this?

226
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,130
That relationship she made
such a huge deal about just ended.

227
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,070
So, for a while, I'd guess?

228
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,010
Anyway, where are you off to?
And what's that you've got?

229
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,010
Actually, I'm about to make
a big deal out of something myself.

230
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,410
Get out of here.

231
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,700
What?

232
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,630
He's not here.

233
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,170
There.

234
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,850
A surprise like this is
what makes dating fun, right?

235
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,790
We need to nail down the ad concept
for this season.

236
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,990
Yes, go ahead.

237
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,230
We need to check
consumer feedback beforehand...

238
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,730
so our marketing team...

239
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,770
can accurately define
our target audience.

240
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,940
So you're saying you need the data.

241
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,240
So we can align our strategy.

242
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,110
Right, of course.

243
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,210
So, what's the deadline
for the consumer review data?

244
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,110
To make the fall season deadline,
we need it by October at the latest.

245
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,380
Really? October...

246
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,620
October?

247
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,990
- Gosh! October!
- What? Why?

248
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,620
- October.
- What is it?

249
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,360
What's wrong?

250
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,800
Are you all right?

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,000
No! It's just that...

252
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,500
I just mean that October
might be a little tight.

253
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,070
I see.

254
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,470
Our rivals...

255
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,470
- are releasing products too,
- Get him to leave.

256
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,280
so delays put us in a tough spot.

257
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,740
Okay, let's take
all the time we can...

258
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,310
to prepare and get things in order.

259
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,180
- Thanks for coming.
- Okay. Are you sure you're okay?

260
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,580
Yes, I'm fine.

261
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,420
Wait a minute.

262
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,590
Goodness.

263
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,790
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

264
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,360
- One worry leads...
- What are you doing?

265
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,570
- to another.
- Get him to leave.

266
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,930
- And then another, and another.
- Make him leave.

267
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
How should I put this?

268
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,840
Look, whatever it is,
just go with your gut.

269
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,940
It's like taking a test.

270
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,840
Your first guess is
usually the right answer.

271
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,350
Dr. Ham, you're absolutely right.

272
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,380
Just like my gut instinct,

273
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,880
I'll grind my team...

274
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,690
- into the ground.
- What?

275
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,390
No, I didn't mean grind...
What am I talking about?

276
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,620
I need to change the system.

277
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,060
I'll have them write
20 reports a day,

278
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
and make them...

279
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,160
- brainstorm ideas nonstop.
- Tell him no.

280
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,230
Making them work overtime
like crazy.

281
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,300
That was my gut instinct.

282
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,300
Just like making soup stock,
I'll keep simmering them down...

283
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,640
- for those rich, savory ideas...
- Maybe you should...

284
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,540
rethink that.

285
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,880
That "first guess is right" thing...

286
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,610
What's wrong? Are you hurt?
What's the matter?

287
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,510
Where does it hurt? Let me help you.

288
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,850
Mr. Ko, just a second.

289
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,660
Wait, hold on.
Mr. Ko, just give me a second.

290
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,890
- I hit my knee.
- Let me just...

291
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,190
- It's Jung Da Hee.
- I think...

292
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,930
No, wait. Just a second.

293
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm fine. It'll just take a second.

294
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,870
Just a second. Wait.

295
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,900
- Just a second.
- I heard you called for me, so I...

296
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,970
Oh, my, what in the world...

297
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,980
Dr. Ham, what are you doing?

298
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,910
You're confusing me.

299
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,320
- Gosh.
- Oh, dear.

300
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,890
I got dizzy all of a sudden.
Maybe it's anemia?

301
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,990
Anemia? Oh, dear.

302
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,360
So it was your anemia all along.
Of course. The anemia.

303
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,660
Da Hee, come over here.

304
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,840
She's the one in charge
of our new Cocomishu project.

305
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,480
I thought it'd be better
to discuss this in person.

306
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,350
You really didn't have to come
all this way.

307
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,750
This is the new Cocomishu proposal.

308
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,220
Please take a look.

309
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Oh, no.

310
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,430
Da Hee.
You overworked and skipped meals.

311
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,630
Goodness, you must be starving...

312
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,070
What?

313
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,840
What's this?

314
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,040
- That's...
- You prepared snacks for us.

315
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,250
Thank you so much.
That's so thoughtful of you.

316
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,780
- Oh, gosh.
- Da Hee, here, eat this for now.

317
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,220
Thank you.

318
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,050
Da Hee!

319
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,690
Eat it right there.

320
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,560
You need to eat quickly
so you can get back to work.

321
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,090
Okay. Thank you.

322
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,130
Take your time. Eat slowly.

323
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,530
- Sure.
- Now,

324
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,460
about our new product proposal...

325
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,730
I'll explain it in detail.

326
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,170
Da Hee?

327
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,610
Da Hee!

328
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,280
Yes.

329
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,210
Yes. Understood.

330
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,850
What did they say? What happened?

331
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,220
Well, for now,
someone from the distributor...

332
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,550
has agreed to visit tomorrow.

333
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,690
Darn it.

334
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,760
I heard their MD was replaced,

335
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,330
but I never imagined they'd refuse
to carry our new product.

336
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,530
We must get it on their shelves.
Our bonuses are on the line.

337
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,330
Let's propose a joint NPB deal
so they have to carry our product.

338
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,040
I have to make this a success
so I can buy more crypto...

339
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,110
- What did you just say?
- What?

340
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,870
Nothing.

341
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,010
So, how's that NPB product strategy
report coming along?

342
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,980
Gosh! Eun Sang!

343
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,480
Do you have any idea how long
we've been in this business?

344
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,350
Eun Sang, we're experts at this.

345
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,990
- Just trust us on this.
- Sure.

346
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,790
Well done.

347
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,730
You got the product identity...

348
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,900
- and production schedule right,
- Yes.

349
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,600
but you put down the wrong product
for the presentation.

350
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,510
We talked about Butter Cracker,
not granola bars.

351
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,610
Right. It was crackers.

352
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,250
I guess I have to do everything
around here.

353
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,990
- What on earth did you do?
- Sorry?

354
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,660
What did you do to the cookies?

355
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,230
What did you put in them?

356
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,660
What do you mean?
I didn't put anything in them.

357
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,200
It was just cake flour
and peanut butter.

358
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,270
I followed a YouTube video exactly.

359
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,400
And you didn't add a little love?

360
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,610
- I'm so disappointed.
- Are you kidding me right now?

361
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,710
How's Da Hee doing?

362
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,910
She seems to be okay
after the IV drip.

363
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,080
The real problem is Mr. Ko.

364
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,420
Mr. Ko? Why?

365
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,120
This is a crime!

366
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,890
No matter how I look at it,

367
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,230
Da Hee just got caught
in the middle.

368
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,400
It's a premeditated crime
against Dr. Ham.

369
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,930
It's hardly a crime.

370
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,300
- That's right.
- It's a crime.

371
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,670
A perfect, premeditated crime.

372
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,870
We can't let them get away with it.

373
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,340
What's with this sudden teamwork?

374
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,840
Let's go to the security office.

375
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,610
Pull up all the CCTV footage,

376
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,750
and plaster
that criminal's face everywhere.

377
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,580
They need to be thrown in jail.

378
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,220
- Mr. Ko!
- Gosh, you scared me. What?

379
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,320
- What is it?
- Well...

380
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,490
How about we all get a snack?

381
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,060
- Out of the blue?
- I've been meaning...

382
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,730
to treat everyone to something,

383
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,930
but I haven't had the chance.

384
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,130
And as it happens,
a new cafe just opened up nearby.

385
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,700
You know the one, right?
Bread High, that new hot spot.

386
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,340
You mean that Bread High?

387
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,810
How about some iced Americanos
and macadamia cookies for everyone?

388
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,010
I'm in.

389
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,980
- Me too.
- Sounds delicious.

390
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,550
And for you, Mr. Ko,
I'll get you a special custom order.

391
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,990
An espresso shot
with a splash of low-fat milk...

392
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,090
and a single drop of vanilla syrup.

393
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,990
The Ko Dae Young Special.

394
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,100
- A special?
- Yes.

395
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,630
All right then,

396
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,700
let's grab some coffee first.

397
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Let's go.

398
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,940
- Come on, grab your stuff.
- Alright.

399
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,010
But Da Hee, I don't think
they deliver. Is that okay?

400
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,250
- And it looks like it might rain.
- What?

401
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,250
They don't deliver?

402
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,990
Darn it!

403
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,290
I can't believe one relationship
is causing all this trouble.

404
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,820
Gosh!

405
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,920
Are you awake?

406
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,250
Dr. Ham.

407
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,590
They said they needed to run
a few more tests.

408
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,760
I feel fine.

409
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,730
Have you been here this whole time?

410
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,960
It happened in my office,

411
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,400
so I should take
some responsibility.

412
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,070
No. Whoever left the cookies
is to blame.

413
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,070
What?

414
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,640
(Byeon Ju Man)

415
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,910
You should get that. I'll be quiet.

416
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,310
No, it's fine.

417
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,920
Is that your girlfriend?

418
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,550
I'd hate for her to hear my voice
and get the wrong idea.

419
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,360
I do have a girlfriend,

420
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,590
but this is just
one of my guy friends.

421
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,970
I knew it.
You give off the vibe you're taken.

422
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,940
What? What are you smiling about?

423
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,910
To be honest,

424
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,880
I secretly thought you and Da Hae
would make a great couple.

425
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,520
But now that you've told me
you have a girlfriend,

426
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,290
I feel a little silly
for thinking that.

427
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,260
Why? Do we
really look good together?

428
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,430
You do to me.

429
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,500
I'll just have to set Da Hae up
with someone even better, then.

430
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,900
Why set her up with a guy?

431
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,940
Why do you worry about
every little thing like that?

432
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,810
Because I enjoy looking out
for people like that.

433
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,480
That's just how I am.

434
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,280
I figured Ms. Jung
probably has a boyfriend.

435
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,650
No.

436
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,980
Da Hae told me
she wasn't seeing anyone.

437
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,350
Come on, that could just be
what she says. Just words.

438
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,760
If she were, you'd be able to tell,

439
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,560
but I haven't seen any signs.

440
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,360
It's not that obvious?

441
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
No. Don't you think?

442
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,410
Da Hae told me
she's not seeing anyone.

443
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,310
If she were, you'd be able to tell,

444
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,050
but I haven't seen any signs.

445
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,690
Hey, it's me.

446
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,690
Where are you?

447
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,190
I'm still at the office.

448
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
The office?

449
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,870
I have a lot of work to do
covering for Da Hee.

450
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,270
I have to rewrite the report too.

451
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,900
Wait, why are you doing that?

452
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,540
She's in this mess because of me.
Should I just look the other way?

453
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,310
I told you not to call me at work.
What if we get caught?

454
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,850
Hold on.

455
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,920
Let me just ask you one thing.

456
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
What is it?

457
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,920
Now that things are like this,

458
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,090
will you ever...

459
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,960
- tell people about us?
- Da Hae!

460
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,030
I'm hanging up.

461
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,260
(Call ended)

462
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,040
Here's the data on the Cocomishu.
Could you make a PowerPoint summary?

463
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,010
- All of this?
- It can't be helped.

464
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,670
I was worried with Da Hee being out,

465
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,940
but you're a real lifesaver, Da Hae.
Thanks.

466
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,910
Wait, this one's mine.

467
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,680
You're welcome.

468
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,620
I'm just reaping what I sowed.

469
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,460
All right, let's wrap this up first.

470
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Cocomishu...

471
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,990
Welcome. How many are in your party?

472
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,990
This way to table three, please.

473
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,060
Welcome. How many are in your party?

474
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,190
Have a reservation? Name, please?

475
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,200
What are you doing?

476
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,300
I'm about to unleash
this train wreck.

477
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,670
What choice do I have?

478
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,500
I'm trying for a job
at the BBQ place.

479
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,640
So I'm practicing just in case.

480
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,740
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

481
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,040
Your song was way more grating.

482
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,680
I've got a problem.
I need your advice.

483
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,010
Call a helpline.
Try the city's complaint line.

484
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,850
- It's about a secret relationship.
- Break up.

485
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,250
- But they have their reasons.
- Split up.

486
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,060
They work at the same company.
The guy's in a higher position.

487
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,460
- She feels pressured by that.
- Just give up already!

488
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,560
If you can't beat it with effort,
you have to know when to give up.

489
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,530
Do you feel better holding on,
making all these excuses?

490
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,430
Is this about my relationship
or music?

491
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,870
It's all an obsession, you punk.

492
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,640
Things that are pointless,
things that are meaningless...

493
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,310
You'll destroy yourself
clinging to things like that.

494
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,610
She likes me too, you know.

495
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,540
It's not some
pointless relationship.

496
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,950
She even baked me cookies
and wrote me a letter.

497
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,250
A letter?

498
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,690
Right. The letter.

499
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,420
Yes, I'm at the Sano Building.

500
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,660
I'll have
a small tuna sashimi and...

501
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,090
Hold on a second.

502
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,300
You want a drink now, don't you?

503
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,830
Should I get a large tuna
and a bottle of kaoliang?

504
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,400
You jerk. You got a death wish?

505
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,640
Sorry, I'll order next time.

506
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,700
- The letter. Where did I put it?
- Thank you.

507
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,910
Oh, it's at the office.

508
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,980

where's the NPB planning list?

00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,600

At least turn off the TV...

521

Sir, if you'll permit me,
I have a proposal for our team.

531
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,510
Permission granted.

532
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,570
What we need...

533
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,010
is the spirit of a soldier, sir!

534
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,210
- What?
- What?

535
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,150
To focus on our objective
and waste no time,

536
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,850
for maximum efficiency and teamwork,
we need the spirit of a soldier!

537
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,620
We all need to approach our work...

538
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,950
with the discipline
of soldiers, sir.

539
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,690
On that note, I will now commence
the mission briefing, sir.

540
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,660
Hold on. Isn't this military act
going too far?

541
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,090
Our team leader is right here too.

542
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,100
This company commander
is deeply moved.

543
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,670
Mr. Cheon?

544
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,030
I love the military style!

545
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,440
It brings back memories!

546
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,200
That's right. You were in the ROTC,
weren't you?

547
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,510
The market analysis is insufficient!

548
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,780
By 3:05 p.m. today,

549
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,780
you will each research
five case studies.

550
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,380
If we don't come up with
a proper response,

551
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,880
we will not secure
this contract, sir!

552
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,720
How are we supposed to get that done
by 3 p.m.?

553
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,090
Roll to the left.

554
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,420
Why is my body moving on its own?
Oh, my.

555
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,190
- Roll to the right!
- Roll to the right.

556
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,260
Can't you do it properly?

557
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,730
Why aren't you joining him?

558
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,030
- My gosh, I...
- Roll to the left.

559
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,600
- Roll to the left.
- Roll to the left.

560
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,200
- Left.
- Left is this way.

561
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,530
Right. Roll to the left.

562
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,670
Roll to the right!

563
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,870
Roll to the right.

564
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,770
Darn it!

565
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,340
Our performance bonuses
are on the line.

566
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,510
We'll do this with grit and guts.
Understood?

567
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,120
- Yes, ma'am!
- I can't hear you! Understood?

568
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,990
- Yes!
- Yes!

569
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,920
Are you sure you're all right?

570
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,190
I'm really fine, so you don't need
to worry about me.

571
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,660
- I'm sorry for worrying you.
- Don't be.

572
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,100
Did you finish organizing
the Cocomishu data?

573
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,130
I'll go get it for you right now.

574
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,670
Get some rest.

575
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Da Hee?

576
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,140
Da Hae.

577
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,910
Are you feeling any better?

578
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,080
I'm totally fine.

579
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,620
By the way, I heard you covered
for me yesterday.

580
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,690
I'm so sorry about that.

581
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,220
- It's no big deal. I was fine.
- Today, I was going to...

582
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,960
No, never mind.

583
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,190
Let me buy you lunch tomorrow.

584
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,660
I have to stop
by the security office at lunch.

585
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,460
The security office? Why?

586
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,270
Dr. Ham's office...

587
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,540
isn't a place
just anyone can get into,

588
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,310
and we don't even know
who left those cookies.

589
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,680
To just end up
on his desk like that...

590
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,750
It just seems like a security risk
for the company.

591
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,050
I think I need to look into it.

592
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,920
Is all that really necessary?

593
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
What was that?

594
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,820
It was nothing.

595
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,860
Hey, should I go for you?

596
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,430
Since you're still not feeling...

597
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,660
That's perfect.

598
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,470
It'd be even better
if you came with me.

599
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,000
I was a little scared to go alone.

600
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,040
What?

601
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Together?

602
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,250
Ji Song, did you send that fax?

603
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,810
Yes.

604
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,080
You didn't send 20 pages at once
like yesterday, did you?

605
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,550
Of course not.

606
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,090
I scheduled it to send
just the pages you asked for.

607
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,630
We're all out of paper.
I need to refill the printer paper.

608
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,000
I'll be right back.

609
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,100
Hey... Ji Song.

610
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,110
Hey, Ji Song!

611
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,540
Why does she keep...

612
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,450
You must be thrilled, Mr. Oh.

613
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Sorry?

614
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,720
Ji Song is obviously avoiding you.

615
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,150
Why would I be happy about that?

616
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,960
You really don't get women at all.

617
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,360
Don't you see?

618
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,860
Now that you've gotten so handsome,

619
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,000
Ji Song is just being shy
around you.

620
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,430
And she has a particular weakness
for handsome men.

621
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,570
Really?

622
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,040
Seems like it.

623
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,940
I guess your crush...

624
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,140
isn't one-sided anymore.

625
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,410
What? No way.

626
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,320
Gosh, it's exhausting trying
to avoid him all the time.

627
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,190
I might as well just disappear.

628
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,430
What? No way.

629
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,360
She wants to watch
the security footage with you?

630
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,000
- What do I do?
- Gosh.

631
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,340
How about getting your story
straight with Dr. Ham?

632
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,140
Say he ordered cookies and forgot.

633
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,170
Just say you ran an errand for him.

634
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,510
- I can't.
- Why not?

635
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,540
Because I didn't just go there
once or twice.

636
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,850
If she goes back a few days
on the CCTV footage,

637
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,320
she'll even see us
holding hands in the hall.

638
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,990
- What if she sees that?
- Gosh.

639
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,560
Just say your hand was heavy,
so Dr. Ham was helping you carry it.

640
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,290
But I even had my arm around him.

641
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,460
Your arms were heavy,

642
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,800
so you just rested them
on his shoulder.

643
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,100
Just say you rested them there
like this.

644
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,900
We kissed too.

645
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,770
Because your lips were heavy...

646
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,170
No, wait. Never mind.

647
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,340
Seriously? Messing around at work?

648
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,470
Even I don't do that anymore.

649
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,480
What am I going to do?

650
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,410
Wait a second.

651
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,310
(Marketing Team Jung Da Hee)

652
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,080
Oh, no. It's Da Hee calling.

653
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,480
- Just go.
- Go on.

654
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,780
- Da Hae.
- Go on.

655
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,820
You're coming with me.

656
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,860
Where?

657
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,220
- Failure is not an option! Yes?
- What?

658
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,360
- Yes?
- Come!

659
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,860
Where? Where are you taking me?

660
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes.

661
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,100
But we can't check the CCTV footage
for every single day.

662
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,640
We just need yesterday's footage...

663
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,340
from the 18th-floor hallway.

664
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,970
But you know,

665
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,080
we don't actually know how long
those cookies were sitting there.

666
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,950
I don't think we can just assume
it was yesterday.

667
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,020
- That's a good point.
- Right.

668
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,780
In that case, what if we...

669
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,420
fast-forward through
last week's footage?

670
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,320
What? The entire week?

671
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,520
Yes. Let's start with Monday...

672
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,460
No. On Monday,
we had sushi in his office.

673
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,100
- Should I pull up Monday's footage?
- On Monday,

674
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,700
didn't Dr. Ham have
an off-site meeting that day?

675
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,670
He even came to our team to pick up
the materials for it.

676
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,640
I doubt we'll find anything useful
on that day.

677
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,210
That's right.

678
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,640
Okay, then should we start
with Tuesday?

679
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,980
I used a work report as an excuse
and stayed for an entire hour.

680
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,220
Shall I pull up Tuesday's footage?

681
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,650
There was electrical work being done
on the 18th floor on Tuesday.

682
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,360
So many people
were coming and going.

683
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,260
It'd be hard to spot a stranger.

684
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,860
And Dr. Ham's assistant also said...

685
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,230
they didn't see
who brought the cookies in...

686
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,340
- and when.
- I see.

687
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,970
Right, so...

688
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,710
maybe we should just give up
on the CCTV footage.

689
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,810
Still, I think we should at least
take a look at yesterday's footage.

690
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,310
Could you please show us the footage
from the morning?

691
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
Yes, of course.

692
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Oh, no.

693
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,230
Darn it.

694
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,300
When those elevator doors open,

695
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,560
I'll walk out
holding that cookie box.

696
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,600
Darn. What do I do?

697
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,410
Hey, what are those people doing?

698
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,180
Are they dancing?

699
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,920
- What?
- What is wrong with them?

700
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,820
What's this?

701
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,090
Hey, number one.

702
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,420
Number five.

703
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,620
- Over there.
- There.

704
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,260
- Hey, over there.
- There!

705
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,870
- Eun Sang.
- What?

706
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,910
It's so embarrassing!

707
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,420
Da Hae better treat us
to something amazing for this.

708
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,620
Are they doing a magic trick?

709
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,430
- Over there.
- There.

710
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,060
(Playback speed settings)

711
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,300
I'm getting dizzy.

712
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Let's just watch it quickly, okay?

713
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,070
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

714
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,980
See? It doesn't look like
anyone was there.

715
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,610
You're right.

716
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,720
That's too bad.

717
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,050
Since it's come to this,

718
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,990
- just chalk it up to bad luck...
- I knew it.

719
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,490
I guess I have no choice
but to read the letter.

720
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,760
Excuse me?

721
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,530
Wait, what did you mean by a letter?

722
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,430
It must have been
next to the cookie box.

723
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,870
I didn't notice it then.
It got swept up with my documents.

724
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,670
I only found out this morning
when Mr. Ko sorted my papers.

725
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,510
I see.

726
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,280
So, have you read it?

727
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,910
Not yet.

728
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,850
There's the privacy issue,
for one thing.

729
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,490
But if someone went to the trouble
of avoiding the CCTV...

730
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,490
for them to be that meticulous,

731
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,160
this person might be dangerous.

732
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,230
I think I should take this letter
to the police.

733
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,930
The police?

734
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,800
Good thing it was just me yesterday,

735
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,100
but someone
could've been badly hurt.

736
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,800
I don't even want to think about it.

737
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
I don't know about that.

738
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,810
I really don't think
it's that big of a deal.

739
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,080
So, where's the letter now?

740
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,520
It's in my break room locker.

741
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,690
I'll take it to them
after the meeting.

742
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,190
I see.

743
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,620
The break room?

744
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,660
Aren't you going up?

745
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,500
I'm just going to stop
by the restroom.

746
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,100
- You go on ahead.
- Okay.

747
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,670
This is driving me crazy.

748
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,810
The break room.

749
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,050
Where is it?

750
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,350
(Jung Da Hee)

751
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,990
Darn it.

752
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,870
Okay. Hair dryer.

753
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,770
(Employee Kang Eun Sang)

754
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,420
Is the sales analysis report ready?

755
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,250
- Ready, ma'am!
- Ready, ma'am!

756
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,820
Did you add the supplementary data?

757
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,990
Yes, ma'am!

758
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,000
This instructor is deeply moved.

759
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,330
See? We can do this!

760
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,540
We can get those bonuses!

761
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,540
- Yes!
- Yes!

762
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,610
- Right this way, please.
- The clients are here.

763
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,680
Hello.

764
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,620
- I'm sorry.
- Ji Song.

765
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,750
Yes?

766
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,790
Are you crazy?

767
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,960
Since when is a work document
your personal diary?

768
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,490
What? What's wrong?

769
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,490
Every department is freaking out
because they all got the wrong fax.

770
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,430
Mr. Song just took that
into the meeting.

771
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,530
With this?

772
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,040
I will now present the proposal
on revising our expense management.

773
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,310
To achieve
more efficient expense management,

774
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,640
we will regularly review and improve
our expenditure process.

775
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,550
First, prevent waste
on non-essential trips.

776
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,780
- Okay.
- "Prevent unnecessary tears."

777
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,220
"A new, exciting feeling
has found me."

778
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,050
"My heart is bouncing.
I'm just going with this feeling."

779
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,120
"Hmph, hmph."

780
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,990
(I'm just going with this feeling.
Hmph, hmph.)

781
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,000
No, this is...

782
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,630
What is it?

783
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,300
- What is this?
- Ji Song, are you insane?

784
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,770
Why are you eating that?

785
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:35,180
I'm sorry!

786
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,610
- What's going on?
- I...

787
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Assistant Manager Oh,
I believe you're up next.

788
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,150
Yes. Regarding
each department's budget...

789
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,220
Gosh, that startled me.

790
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,020
- I'm sorry. Just a moment.
- Where are you going?

791
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,020
- Can you take over for me?
- Where are you going?

792
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,520
- Sorry, excuse me!
- Hey!

793
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,030
Ji Song.

794
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,570
Hey, are you okay?

795
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,570
Gosh.

796
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,440
Oh, gosh.

797
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,010
We've looked into this
from a few angles,

798
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,650
and I'm afraid it will be difficult
for us to carry this new product.

799
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,250
We know!

800
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,750
Okay, there's no need to shout.

801
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,020
That's why we...

802
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,460
"are using the Marron Confectionery
brand image..."

803
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,560
"to propose the creation
of an NPB product!"

804
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,830
The thing is,
that's not what we need right now.

805
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,000
Fine, go on. Let's hear it.

806
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:37,470
"So, along with a reliable
Marron Confectionery NPB product,"

807
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,440
"we prepared a sales strategy
for the new product launch..."

808
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:42,940
"for you!"

809
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,680
If you want it in stores so badly,

810
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,280
why not work
with another distributor...

811
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,520
and offer them
a different kind of promotion?

812
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:51,650
That would create a fairness issue.

813
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,550
We...

814
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,920
"Instead, by producing our
Butter Cracker as an NPB product,"

815
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,960
- "we can drive up sales!"
- Excuse me.

816
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,030
Yes?

817
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,800
- Can't you answer without reading?
- Excuse me?

818
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,340
I mean, you've just been reading
from that paper this whole time.

819
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,540
- Can't you answer me without that?
- No, it's just...

820
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,570
It's not that, it's just...

821
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,740
Oh, that was a close call. Darn.

822
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,840
Why did she take this?

823
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,620
Hey.

824
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,030
- Oh, my!
- What's that?

825
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,090
What's happening?

826
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,660
What's going on?

827
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,860
No!

828
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,500
- Oh, my gosh, what do we do?
- What's going on?

829
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,570
Hey!

830
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,140
Regarding the issue you raised,
first...

831
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,970
- What?
- What's going on?

832
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,180
Hey, this thing...

833
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,610
A blackout.

834
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,510
I think we have a blackout!

835
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,150
You've got to be kidding me.

836
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
What do we do?

837
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,350
What do we do?

838
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,220
Say something.

839
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,860
Could you...

840
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,790
please give us a moment?

841
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,100
Why isn't this working?

842
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,460
I think we're trapped.

843
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,000
What do we do?

844
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,430
What?

845
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,300
- It's really not opening?
- No.

846
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,180
The letter.

847
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,680
- I found it.
- You what? Found what?

848
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,760
Yes, hello?
Sir, this is Jung Da Hae.

849
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,830
Yes?

850
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,160
It's about our cookie project.

851
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,230
There was something
I forgot to report.

852
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,600
The letter...

853
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,470
I mean, there was a document,
and I completely forgot about it.

854
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,740
What document?

855
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,850
- A confidential one.
- Confidential?

856
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,410
Yes. It's sort of...

857
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,720
a log of internal communications...

858
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:10,790
This one.

859
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,760
I left this there with the cookies,

860
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,360
but I totally forgot about it.

861
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,070
Thank goodness I found it.

862
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:21,030
Oh, no.

863
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:22,340
What?

864
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:23,970
Where did it go?

865
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,870
If this is what you're looking for,

866
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,780
I have it.

867
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,250
(Oh Dong Gyu)

868
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,390
I'm telling you, I'm fine.
I just twisted my ankle a little.

869
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,690
I know, but still.

870
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,960
I enjoyed your diary, Ji Song.

871
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,330
I wonder who makes
your heart bounce.

872
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,000
Assistant Manager Oh?

873
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,270
Of course not!

874
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,040
Please just put me down.

875
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,470
Come on, you could barely walk.

876
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,980
The elevator's out
due to the blackout,

877
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,740
so let me at least get you to
the nurse's office.

878
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,680
No, I'm fine.
Just put me down, please.

879
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,320
- Put me down.
- Wait...

880
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,090
- Wait, Ji Song.
- Please.

881
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,460
- Hey, Ji Song.
- Gosh.

882
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,730
Ji Song, what's wrong?
Why are you crying?

883
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,800
Is it your ankle?
Does it hurt that much?

884
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,170
It's not that.

885
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,000
It's because of you,
Assistant Manager Oh.

886
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,310
I just feel so bad.

887
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,740
What? What for? Why?

888
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,120
I don't feel any butterflies.

889
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,790
How did you...

890
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,420
Your hand. It's bleeding.

891
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,830
I found it in the trash can
at the convenience store.

892
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,200
(Flammable waste)

893
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,240
Oh, gosh.

894
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,650
What?

895
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,490
(To Dr. Ham)

896
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,700
I think this smell has seeped
into my very bones.

897
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,130
Still,

898
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,500
you didn't have to go
digging through the trash.

899
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,040
You usually pretend not to know me
when other people are around.

900
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,010
A letter from someone like that...

901
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,440
How could I throw away
a top-secret document like this?

902
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,650
- But still...
- It's okay.

903
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,180
It's a sickness of mine.
I'm drawn to things that are futile.

904
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,690
I never meant to fall this hard.

905
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,690
But what can you do?

906
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,160
If this is really my sickness,

907
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,290
I'll just suffer through it,

908
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,030
and I don't care if it kills me.

909
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,130
I...

910
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:08,570
I...

911
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,540
(Ham Ji Woo)

912
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,740
(Ham Ji Woo)

913
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,180
It's not pointless.

914
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,880
It means something. Darn it.

915
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,150
- What's going on? What's wrong?
- What's she doing?

916
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,560
What are you doing?

917
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,190
We can't just stay trapped in here.
Dr. Ham is hurt.

918
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,830
Gosh. You're hurt?

919
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,260
Then let us help you push.

920
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,330
No.

921
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:14,470
You make it sound like an emergency.
Just stay put.

922
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,700
No! I'm taking you to the hospital.

923
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,110
It's not designed to move like that.

924
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,540
Da Hae, you'll get hurt. Stay put.

925
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,380
I don't care if I get hurt!
I'm telling you, we have to get out.

926
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,080
I'm telling you, it won't open.
Da Hae, you'll get seriously hurt.

927
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,980
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't solve this with force.

928
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,550
For crying out loud.

929
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,490
It just opened.

930
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,700
Are you all right?

931
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,400
Da Hae, are you okay?

932
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,530
I'll take her to the hospital.
You guys go on ahead.

933
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,600
Okay.

934
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,270
My gosh.

935
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,980
Just so you know,
I can't help it if people see us.

936
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,950
I can't just leave
an injured person, so...

937
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,010
I like you.

938
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,020
What?

939
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,260
Dr. Ham, I like you.

940
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,220
I really like you.

941
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,100
From now on, I won't hide it
and say it out loud.

942
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,400
And if words aren't enough...

943
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,870
If they're not enough?

944
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,640
If they aren't enough...

945
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,310
Then keep saying it until they are.

946
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,170
What was that? You like me?

947
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,210
- That's what I said.
- What was that? You like me?

948
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,110
- I said I like you.
- What was that? You like me?

949
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,080
- What's wrong with you?
- Say it again.

950
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,420
I think...

951
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,320
I don't...

952
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,890
get butterflies over
handsome guys anymore.

953
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,230
Even after breaking up with someone
as handsome as Wei Lin,

954
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,600
I'm still eating just fine.

955
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,070
What are you doing?

956
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,280
And even when I start to cry,
it doesn't last very long.

957
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,420
Are you crying?

958
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,890
What's so great about love anyway?

959
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,420
I'm going to bed.

960
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,690
And, more than anything,

961
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,500
even when I see the prettiest ring
in the world,

962
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,730
something else catches my eye first.

963
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,070
Hey, you got a field jacket?
Something like a military uniform.

964
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,170
- What are you doing?
- Eun Sang.

965
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,270
It says you can buy that
with an interest-free plan.

966
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:37,080
There you go.

967
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,410
That's more like it.

968
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,980
You really never change, do you?

969
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,150
Do all your relationships
end by splurging?

970
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,390
No, that's not it.

971
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,020
"Interest-free" is
just a sales tactic.

972
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,820
The retailer pays the commission,

973
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,990
and that cost is included
in the price.

974
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,230
So it's nothing
to get excited about.

975
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,460
What's with you?

976
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,960
I've been taking
an economics course online.

977
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,300
What?

978
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,900
Eun Sang.

979
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,640
I'm honestly really sad.

980
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,100
Breaking up with him hurts so much.

981
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,870
But it's weird.

982
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:09,510
It doesn't feel like
my world's ended.

983
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,380
And that's kind of bittersweet,
you know?

984
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,550
I guess I'm changing too. Right?

985
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:18,420
Assistant Manager Oh,
you've gotten so handsome.

986
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,450
Even the back of your head...

987
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:23,290
It's like your face was re-sculpted.
You look amazing.

988
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,160
But I'm not getting any butterflies.

989
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,500
I know I should feel butterflies,
if only out of common decency.

990
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,130
I feel so bad about it.
I really should be.

991
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,600
Especially after I said
handsome guys are my type.

992
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,140
I don't even get butterflies,

993
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,280
and I feel so bad about that...

994
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,680
That's why I couldn't face you.

995
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:52,320
Then what gives you butterflies now?

996
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,160
Money!

997
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:03,060
Watching the money pile up
in my crypto account is just...

998
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,830
so thrilling. It's a total rush.

999
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,400
Wait, what about Gang Dong Won?

1000
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:10,570
Sorry?

1001
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,010
You wouldn't get butterflies
even for Gang Dong Won?

1002
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,340
He's an exception, of course.

1003
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,080
Gang Dong Won is in a league
of his own.

1004
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,020
Wait, your taste didn't change.

1005
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,050
It just expanded.

1006
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,950
Gosh, and here I was...

1007
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,090
thinking it was something serious.

1008
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,560
What?

1009
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,960
Ji Song,
you should just follow your heart.

1010
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,830
You don't have to worry about me.

1011
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,370
But still...

1012
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,500
Come on. Let's get going.

1013
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,200
Okay.

1014
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,140
Careful.

1015
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,710
Are you okay?

1016
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,650
Let me piggyback you
just to the nurse's office.

1017
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,580
- What?
- Come on, hurry.

1018
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,050
- But...
- Come on, quickly.

1019
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,660
I'm sorry.

1020
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,800
Just don't avoid me so much, okay?

1021
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,040
Then I'll just...

1022
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,970
be fine on my own.

1023
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,340
I won't ask for anything more.

1024
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,910
What kind of thing is that to say?

1025
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,720
That just makes me feel worse.

1026
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,020
Stop crying, all right?

1027
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,120
(Marron Confectionery)

1028
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,370
Oh, you're still here?

1029
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,140
How could we leave before you?

1030
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,780
Eun Sang, I'm sorry.

1031
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,710
You worked so hard on that meeting,
and I ruined it.

1032
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,880
No, it's not your fault.

1033
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,120
Do you guys want to get a drink
with me tonight?

1034
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,630
- With us?
- With us?

1035
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,700
When I think about it,
this is all my fault.

1036
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,530
No!

1037
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,340
It's my fault, okay?

1038
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:24,870
Come on.

1039
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,010
What's done is done. Why rehash it?

1040
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,480
You've been doing so well.
Why are you acting like this now?

1041
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,680
Can you nail
this presentation or not?

1042
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,650
Your discipline is completely shot!

1043
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,020
Saet Byul, are you okay?

1044
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,420
No, it's just the power
went out at Daddy's office,

1045
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,590
so I got worried and wanted to check
if you lost power too.

1046
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,860
Don't worry, Daddy's fine.
Daddy's a Superman, right?

1047
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,230
Nothing in the world can scare me.

1048
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,260
I'll call you back in a bit, okay?

1049
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,570
Sorry about that.

1050
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,440
I was worried because
my daughter was home alone.

1051
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,540
Eun Sang.

1052
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,310
I'm sorry.

1053
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,610
I ruined everything.

1054
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,680
Come on.

1055
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:08,580
I'm a team leader now,
so why can't I pull my own weight?

1056
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,020
Earlier, that guy...

1057
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,890
just glared at me and scoffed,

1058
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,220
so I just got intimidated.

1059
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,160
My mind went completely blank.

1060
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,230
Look.

1061
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,070
Why are you beating yourself up
so much over it?

1062
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,220
Eun Sang, are you really upset?

1063
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,960
Your eyes are all red.

1064
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,530
No. I'm not.

1065
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,840
But Eun Sang.

1066
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,370
Earlier,

1067
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,880
you were crying, weren't you?

1068
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,350
Well...

1069
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,810
No, it's not that.

1070
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:21,690
It's just that a man
who's a superhero at home...

1071
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,760
has to constantly bow his head
to other people.

1072
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:33,100
For a man his age to be disrespected
while he's trying to work...

1073
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,170
I just wondered
if that's how it really has to be.

1074
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,640
Hey, that's just part of the job.
It happens.

1075
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,640
No.

1076
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,980
Work is tough enough as it is,

1077
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,190
so I shouldn't have made it
even harder for you.

1078
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,760
I'm sorry.

1079
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,960
I neglected my actual duties,

1080
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,670
and at some point,

1081
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,270
I started to see you both...

1082
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,900
as just another problem
that I had to solve.

1083
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,310
Well...

1084
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,840
We can be a bit of a handful.

1085
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:22,580
From now on, I'm going to do better.
I swear.

1086
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,820
You've always tried your best.

1087
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,020
And you're doing a great job now.

1088
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,990
Eun Sang.

1089
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,760
You've really changed.

1090
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,860
I have?

1091
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,160
For guys like us, who are nothing,

1092
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:42,170
you care so much
and even cry for us.

1093
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,540
I told you I wasn't crying.

1094
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:47,710
I never thought you'd agree
to have a drink with us.

1095
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,940
- Now you're treating us to drinks.
- I never said I was paying.

1096
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,850
Do you remember how badly
we wanted to grab a drink...

1097
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,250
with her after work?

1098
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,650
- That's right!
- Right?

1099
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:02,520
- Hey.
- Always.

1100
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,930
Work might have been a bust,
but I'm feeling great tonight.

1101
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:11,360
So to celebrate,
drinks are on me tonight!

1102
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,700
- I'll drink to that!
- Cheers.

1103
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,300
- Cheers.
- I can't hear you.

1104
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,010
- Yes!
- Yes!

1105
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,840
- With grit!
- With guts!

1106
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,340
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1107
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,280
Eun Sang,
were you really in the military?

1108
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,580
You're a total natural.

1109
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:31,450
Row the boat!

1110
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,550
Row the boat!

1111
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:34,590
It's fine, let's go.

1112
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,360
My bad. Sorry about that.

1113
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,160
(Marron Confectionery)

1114
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,500
Mr. Ko.

1115
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,730
- I have something to tell you.
- That marketing proposal.

1116
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,940
I submitted your proposal.
Just so you know.

1117
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,910
What? For real?

1118
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:57,240
The personalized
snack subscription service...

1119
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,880
that's tailored to customer tastes.

1120
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,710
It was a fantastic idea.

1121
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,650
Just so there's no misunderstanding,

1122
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,420
it was a completely fair evaluation.

1123
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,220
I didn't give it a push...

1124
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,760
just because you
and Dr. Ham are dating.

1125
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,930
- So don't get me wrong.
- Right.

1126
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,930
Wait, what?

1127
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,700
What?

1128
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,670
How did you know?

1129
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,140
The CCTV footage.

1130
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,810
But still,

1131
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,780
kissing in the company hallway
is a bit much, don't you think?

1132
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,520
You saw that?

1133
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:42,990
But then,

1134
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:44,990
why are you covering for me?

1135
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,960
You're not the only ones in love.

1136
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,530
My wife and I keep romance alive.

1137
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,600
Besides, nothing good comes
from it getting exposed at work.

1138
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,500
And you also turned a blind eye
for me once.

1139
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,910
That money I took before?
I gave it all back.

1140
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:03,540
I didn't keep a single cent.

1141
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:05,810
I see.

1142
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,580
Right.

1143
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:09,680
Ms. Round.

1144
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,350
No, I mean, Ms. Jung Da Hae.

1145
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,720
Hold your head up high.

1146
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,720
You were always so timid,

1147
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,190
it made me want to push you around.

1148
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,660
But it's been great to see
the change in you lately.

1149
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,500
Your taste seems more refined,

1150
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,600
and you've broadened your horizons.

1151
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,300
And best of all,

1152
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,370
I love seeing how confident you are
at work.

1153
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,580
Right. Thank you.

1154
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,050
I'm really going to try...

1155
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,690
to hold my head high from now on.

1156
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,060
Right. Hold your head high
and just focus on your work.

1157
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,830
Yes, sir.

1158
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,960
All right, enough of this.

1159
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,330
Come on, let's get to work.

1160
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,800
Breaking news, everyone!
This is huge.

1161
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,770
Dr. Ham put in his resignation.

1162
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,780
Hoppang Bite posted it
on the message board.

1163
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,810
What do you mean?

1164
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:11,940
What did you say?

1165
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,520
(Epilogue)

1166
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,620
Excuse me?

1167
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,760
What did you just ask?

1168
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,190
I asked why you ate the cookie.

1169
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,930
- That's because you told me...
- Don't you have a peanut allergy?

1170
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,600
I'm sorry?

1171
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,100
That's what they said
at the hospital.

1172
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:35,600
That it was
a typical allergy symptom.

1173
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,300
You must have known
you were allergic.

1174
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,910
But anyone could see it was full
of almonds and peanuts,

1175
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:44,240
so I'm wondering why you ate
something full of them.

1176
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:49,050
I guess I didn't look that closely.
I had no idea.

1177
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:50,120
You had no idea?

1178
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,820
Fine, let's say that's true.

1179
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,120
- What about the letter?
- The letter?

1180
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,660
Didn't you see the letter
next to the box of cookies that day?

1181
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,730
Yes, I saw it.

1182
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:04,460
Mr. Ko thought it was for me
and put it on my desk.

1183
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,870
So where is it now?

1184
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:07,370
I threw it out.

1185
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:15,740
It didn't seem important.

1186
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,010
What did you say?

1187
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:22,620
Was it something really important?

1188
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,620
What should I do?
I swear I didn't mean any harm.

1189
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:30,690
Even if you didn't mean any harm,

1190
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,290
I'd say there was a hidden agenda,
wouldn't you?

1191
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:36,830
Looking at you now, Da Hee...

1192
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,400
You have a peculiar personality.

1193
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:43,500
What's your deal?

1194
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,370
Are you just born that way?

1195
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:51,910
(To the Moon)

1196
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,700
(Special thanks to Zhang Hao
for his cameo)

1197
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,630
What's going on?

1198
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,970
Enderion has plummeted...

1199
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:17,200
- by nearly 30 percent.
- Hurry, run!

1200
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,570
Shouldn't we pull our money out?

1201
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,240
Are you crazy?
If we sell now, we'll be real fools.

1202
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,180
We're all going to get wiped out.

1203
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,640
We should stay out of crypto
for now.

1204
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,150
I heard someone at our company
made a million dollars.

1205
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:30,150
Weren't you investing too, Da Hae?

1206
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,480
Or was it just Eun Sang
who profited?

1207
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,850
Everyone at work is saying
Eun Sang is going to quit.

1208
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:36,920
Then why hasn't she
told us anything?

1209
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:41,190
