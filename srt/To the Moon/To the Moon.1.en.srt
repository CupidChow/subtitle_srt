Welcome, passengers.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,350
Thank you for riding
with us again today.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,120
Our train is departing
from the wretched reality...

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,260
where the value of labor
is not respected,

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,060
bound for its final destination,
the Moon.

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,000
However, we cannot guarantee...

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,510
your safe arrival.

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,780
Along the way,
you will face numerous hardships, trials,

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,450
and some rather cringey situations.

15
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,020
Nevertheless, for those of you
with unrealized dreams and hopes,

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,490
we urge you
to please board promptly.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,660

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,120
I can do this.

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,090
I can get...

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,760
a permanent position.

26
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,730
(Honey)

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,330
Honey, did you get there okay?

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,200
Don't be nervous. You got this!
You'll definitely get the position.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
I love you!

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,210
(New hire and temp-to-perm

31
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,440
Ms. Jung Da Hae?

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,540
- Come in.
- Okay.

33
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,880
I see you've interned
with us before.

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,680
Yes. It wasn't a standard program,

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,690
but they gave me
a great opportunity,

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,320
and I spent the last year interning here
at Marron Confectionery.

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,590
If we hire you,

38
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,760
are there any products
you'd like to develop?

39
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,930
Marron Confectionery is
very popular with consumers,

40
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,800
but its market share in
the pie category is relatively low.

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,670
That's why I'd like to launch
an original pie product.

42
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,370
All right, then. What is this?

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,940
Why don't you explain the key points
for the Kong Kong Chip?

44
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,850
I believe the key marketing point
is childhood nostalgia.

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,450
The first color TV ad concept
won over people...

46
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,620
in their 30s and 40s,

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,890
and I believe
it resonated strongly with them.

48
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,490
Do you have any final remarks?

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,660
Yes.

50
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,370
I am truly eager to
officially join your company.

51
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,370
If you give me the opportunity
to work here permanently...

52
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,740
Was she stung by a bee?
Was she stung?

53
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
Are you okay? Ms. Jung?

54
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
- What should we do?
- Ms. Jung?

55
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,060
Are you with me?

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,490
What?

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,130
Why is my face over there?

58
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,730
Just calm down.

59
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,970
Wait a minute. Is this a dream?

60
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,030
Or am I dead?

61
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,770
- Are you the Grim Reaper?
- No, it's not like that.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,340
You just passed out for a second.
I'm your future self, Jung Da Hae.

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,840
What?

64
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,310
Me from the future?

65
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,150
There's no need to stare.

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,680
Sadly, the diet was a bust.

67
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,250
You must've eaten
something really good.

68
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,790
But what's with your appearance?

69
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,330
What happened?
Is there a war in the future?

70
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,690
Are you a refugee?

71
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,060
I'm not sure.

72
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,330
Even if so, you've got nowhere
to seek refuge, right?

73
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,970
- What?
- Whatever.

74
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,330
I'll get straight to the point.

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,770
You cannot join this company.

76
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,540
- That's why I came here.
- What are you talking about?

77
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,940
Hey! Do you know how hard
I worked to be an employee here?

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,380
If I just ace this interview today,
I'll become a permanent employee.

79
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,520
You don't know what you're saying.

80
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,880
Not all permanent jobs are equal.

81
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,550
You're...

82
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,150
You're...

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,290
You're just a loner.

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,230
You'll always live like a loner.

85
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,460
Nothing will ever go your way,
and you'll be poor year-round.

86
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,430
Your fate is to end up like this.

87
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,070
You'll be consistently miserable.

88
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,000
And you still want to work here?

89
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,310
Gosh.

90
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,280
Yes! I have to get this job.

91
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,910
If I don't get a desk job at my age,
should I go be an idol star?

92
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,680
You think talk like that
will stop me?

93
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,050
You're right.

94
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,050
Talk isn't going to cut it.

95
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,150
Then I'll just have to...

96
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,350
Just die!

97
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,320
What's gotten into you?

98
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,230
No good will come of living anyway.

99
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,530
End it now for a better next life.

100
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,630
Just die!

101
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,200
No!
I have to get a job, even if I die.

102
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,200
No one shows up to
a broke person's funeral.

103
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,240
I don't want to die!

104
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,610
Ms. Jung Da Hae, are you okay?

105
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,610
Ms. Jung, you fainted.

106
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,150
I... I just had this dream...

107
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,520
Goodness,
we need to get you to a hospital.

108
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Your eye is all swollen up
from that bee sting.

109
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,760
No, I'm fine.

110
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,530
I'd like to continue the interview.

111
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,760
No, you really shouldn't.

112
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm telling you, I'm really fine.

113
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,340
A bee sting won't crush my dream
of getting a permanent position.

114
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,070
Please, believe in me.
I'm confident I can do a great job.

115
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,840
They say desperation works miracles,
don't they?

116
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,710
Unemployment rates are hitting
a new all-time high every year.

117
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,110
I miraculously landed
this interview.

118
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,150
Just give me the chance.

119
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,120
I'll be a dedicated Marron employee.

120
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,420
And then...

121
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,460
Miracle, my foot.

122
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,430
That looks so good.

123
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,200
Gosh, look at all the pastries.

124
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,960
Looks delicious.

125
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,770
Why is the line so long?

126
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,870
That looks amazing.

127
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,910
Why aren't you answering?
Is something wrong?

128
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm worried. Please text me back.

129
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,460
Mr. Ko.
Our meeting is about to start.

130
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,860
It's fine. It's just up ahead.

131
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,830
But we only have ten minutes left.

132
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,760
They say this place is even better
than the Gangnam branch.

133
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,430
We're in the sweets business,
so think of this as market research.

134
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,540
My mouth's watering.

135
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,540
Come on.

136
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,440
We're only selling ten more today!

137
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,780
Sorry, everyone!

138
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,680
What? That should be mine.

139
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,650
- Go to the front!
- What?

140
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Gosh, hold on!

141
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,650
Stop pushing!

142
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,690
Wait a minute!

143
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,250
Wait! Gosh, my phone!

144
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,320
My phone! Wait, excuse me!

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,530
My phone.

146
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,060
Wait. No. Hey, don't step on it!

147
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,970
Don't step on it! No. Don't...

148
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,640
Darn it.

149
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,880
That jerk. He's got some luck.

150
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,280
This is great. So decadent.

151
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,120
We're late. Run!

152
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,050
Darn it.

153
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,120
Mr. Ko!

154
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,240
Come on, hurry up!

155
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,980
Yes, I'm coming!
Why did you have to order coffee?

156
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,240
Coffee is important to me.

157
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,350
If I bomb my presentation
without it,

158
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,450
will you take responsibility?

159
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,880
Why would it be my fault?

160
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,080
- Darn it.
- "Darn it?"

161
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,490
Are you okay?

162
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,930
Yes. I'm fine.

163
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,100
I meant, is the laptop okay?
All of our data is on here.

164
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,230
Seriously... Please be okay.

165
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,370
This better not be broken.
It's fine.

166
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,600
Let's go. Hurry up.

167
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,550
Bear with it.

168
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,020
Wait, hold the elevator!

169
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,580
Thank you for waiting.

170
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,620
- I'm so sorry.
- Hurry up!

171
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,850
Sorry about that.

172
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,690
Well...

173
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,490
We've to get off.

174
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,430
Round, you got off?

175
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,730
Good. Take the stairs.

176
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,970
What? All the way to the 14th floor?
But we only have 5 minutes left!

177
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,040
I'll go on ahead and get set up.
Now hurry.

178
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,940
Mr. Ko!

179
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,180
Darn it.

180
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,880
I have to suck it up.
I've no choice.

181
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,950
My performance review is coming up.

182
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,420
I can't exactly kill Mr. Ko.

183
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,790
Hold on.

184
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,790
Darn it.

185
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm going to kill him!

186
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,770
It's 10:59 a.m. and 55 seconds.

187
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,210
Fifty-six seconds.

188
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,340
Fifty-seven seconds.
Fifty-eight seconds.

189
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,080
Fifty-nine seconds.

190
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,150
(Conference Room)

191
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,120
(Marron Confectionery)

192
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,790
As you can see, our new product,

193
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,490
My Grape Glucose, has been
in the planning stage for a while,

194
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,130
but the launch has been delayed
due to the high cost of ingredients.

195
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Meanwhile, our competitor,
Company B,

196
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,940
had a bestseller with grapes
early on,

197
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,840
and they've already moved on
to mango and cherry flavors.

198
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,280
So, after meeting with
both the RnD and Marketing teams,

199
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,650
we decided to develop a new product
using Shine Muscat grapes.

200
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,950
- Hold on.
- Yes?

201
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,950
Shine Muscat?

202
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,760
Isn't that a Japanese variety?

203
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,960
It's from Japan?

204
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,890
What? It's from Japan?

205
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,330
You didn't know?

206
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,530
What do you mean you didn't know?

207
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,030
So what's your plan
for dealing with sentiment...

208
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,230
on the ingredient's source?

209
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,400
A plan?

210
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,900
- Our plan is...
- Do you have one?

211
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,040
A plan?

212
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,710
It'd certainly be nice to have one.

213
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,140
What? "It'd be nice to have one?"

214
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,710
- Well...
- Right, so,

215
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,450
do you have
this "nice-to-have" plan, or not?

216
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,450
Well, our plan is...

217
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,720
What am I going to do?

218
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,190
I've got nothing... What do I do?

219
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,330
Listen up!

220
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,500
Order up!
One big bowl of national pride!

221
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,550
That's the "patriotic marketing"
you've stressed, right, Mr. Cheon?

222
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,150
Yes, that's absolutely right.

223
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,820
You wanted to make a point
of using domestic produce,

224
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,960
so you even analyzed the status of
Shine Muscat grapes grown in Korea.

225
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,290
That's right.
That's absolutely right!

226
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,230
In fact, here in Korea,
ever since 2006,

227
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,000
- we've grown our own Shine Muscats.
- Local is best!

228
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,670
You can't beat homegrown!

229
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,310
Korea!

230
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,680
- Korea!
- Korea!

231
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,780
- Korea!
- Korea!

232
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,420
Ko...

233
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,290
Well, that's not a bad idea.

234
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,100
When the samples are ready,
bring them to us.

235
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,830
Good work.

236
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,230
Thank you, Mr. Vice President!
We'll do our very best!

237
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,230
Thank you!

238
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,340
Thank you, General Affairs Manager!
Thank you, Managing Director!

239
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,010
Thank you, everyone!
We'll work hard.

240
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,740
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

241
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,880
Are you okay, sir?

242
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,320
Sorry, everyone.

243
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,520
If I ever drink that much again,

244
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,090
I'm an animal. A total animal.

245
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,220
Seriously, without Eun Sang,
that would've been a total disaster.

246
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,190
You saved my skin again, Eun Sang.

247
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,590
Thank you.

248
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,030
- Hey, let's get some hangover food.
- Again?

249
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,100
Just how much did you drink
last night, sir?

250
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,180
How was the off-site meeting?

251
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,410
Perfect.

252
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,320
That's our team leader for you.

253
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,150
See? What did I tell you?
We had plenty of time.

254
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,730
You're right.
You're the best, Mr. Ko.

255
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,560
You're the man.

256
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,970
Thanks, Da Hee.

257
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,740
So you have some decency after all.

258
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,870
At least you know to say thank you.

259
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,940
It was nothing. Really, I'm fine.

260
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,280
Check this out, Da Hee.
Look how good this looks.

261
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,050
- This is killer.
- I bought it in Japan this weekend.

262
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,650
It's a top-quality product
by an artisan, sold only in Japan.

263
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,020
I thought it'd be nice
for everyone to try some.

264
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,620
You're why I love coming to work, Da Hee.
You know that?

265
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,030
The meeting went well thanks to you.

266
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,230
Thank you!

267
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,760
- You don't have to say that.
- That jerk.

268
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,800
Here, Round. You have one too.

269
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,400
That darn name, Round.

270
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,140
- Da Hee.
- Yes?

271
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,840
No. I meant Hee, not Hae.

272
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,910
- Da Hee.
- Right.

273
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,650
See me for a second.

274
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,550
(Employee Jung Da Hae)

275
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,890
- Ms. Da Hae?
- Yes?

276
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,090
No, Da Hee. "Hae" as in "sun."

277
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,200
- Da Hae.
- Yes.

278
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,970
I keep mixing up your names.
This is going to be a real problem.

279
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,270
Da Hae, from now on,
I'll just call you Round.

280
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,170
What? Why "Round?"

281
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,440
Do I look round to you or something?

282
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,010
It's not about how you look.
It's just the vibe you give off.

283
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,650
A vibe? What does that even...

284
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,320
Besides, I'm just more used to
saying Da Hae's name.

285
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,550
She started six months before you,
and it's a work thing.

286
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,690
- Da Hee?
- Yes.

287
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,920
Round?

288
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,760
Round?

289
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,860
- Yes, I'm here.
- See? That's better.

290
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,400
And the name problem is solved.

291
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,070
Round.

292
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,510
No, I'm fine.

293
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,470
Give me a piece.

294
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
Come on, just have one.

295
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,210
You worked so hard today.

296
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,750
Well...

297
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,720
Okay, then.
I guess I'll have just one.

298
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,630
Don't eat it!

299
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,730
Wait a second! Just hold it for me.

300
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Let's give these to the execs.
It'll make our lives easier, right?

301
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,600
So I'm just going to run up
to the 18th floor...

302
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,600
What's wrong?

303
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,540
I chugged coffee without eating.
My stomach is really acting up.

304
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,840
Just tell them it's from our team...

305
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,480
Move, get out of my way.

306
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,750
- I'll be right back.
- Mr. Ko, are you okay?

307
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,050
- I'll take this up for you then?
- Yes.

308
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,050
Da Hee.

309
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,850
The Accounting Team wants to see
the Q1 performance report.

310
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,190
Right.
I was going to do that in a bit...

311
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,260
They need it now for their meeting.

312
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,860
Can't you just get someone...

313
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,330
Right.

314
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,400
Da Hae.

315
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,910
Come on.

316
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,780
This is so irritating.
They dump everything on me.

317
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,790
The 18th floor.
The room at the end of the hall?

318
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,920
Which one is the last room?

319
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,500
Excuse me.

320
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,400
What?

321
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,170
Is anybody here?

322
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,640
Goodness.

323
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,010
What is this place?

324
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,350
Gosh, it's like a palace in here.

325
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,950
Goodness.

326
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,750
What?

327
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,990
No way!
I've seen this in commercials.

328
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,730
Goodness.
This is more than three months' pay.

329
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,170
So, what's something this fancy
doing in here?

330
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,100
Maybe they're building
a new staff lounge?

331
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,040
What? Maybe just for a second.

332
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,190
This is nice.

333
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,520
My goodness.

334
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,390
Gosh.

335
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,930
Gosh, that hits the spot.

336
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,500
Goodness.

337
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,200
I see why this is so expensive.

338
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
My gosh.

339
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,370
It's really getting in there...

340
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,580
What's going on?

341
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,250
What?

342
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,550
Why did it stop?

343
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,650
What on earth?

344
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,550
What?

345
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,750
Yes, the remodeling in my office
turned out great.

346
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,190
You really didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

347
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,160
What was that?

348
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,660
But the nameplate was a bit much,
so I just had that replaced.

349
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,200
Wasn't this the staff lounge?

350
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,770
Right.

351
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,340
Gosh, what do I do?
What am I going to do?

352
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,210
First, I'll just get up naturally.

353
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,550
Darn it, it won't move an inch.

354
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,090

What is this?

357
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,730
Where is it going? Is it this one?

358
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,230
Oh, no.

360
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,530
Ta-da! Surprise!

361
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,060
Surprised, right?
You're totally shocked, aren't you?

362
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,900
Right. You can go now.

363
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,800

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,050
Where have I seen her before?

366
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:58,290
You idiot.
Why did you have to sit there?

367
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,220
Why won't this come off? Darn it.

368
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,010
Excuse me.
What's wrong? Are you okay?

369
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,640
The evaluation forms are out.

370
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,650
And just like that,
it was evaluation season.

371
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,790
The company used a five-tier scale
to grade last year's performance.

372
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,060
Congrats. Looks like you'll be
the first of us to get promoted.

373
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,630
No way.

374
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,930
You're always so humble, Da Hee.

375
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,570
Is everyone free for lunch today?
My treat.

376
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,900
Simply put, this one means,
"You did an awesome job."

377
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,540
In that case, I'll get coffee.

378
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,010
This one means,
"Hey, not bad. We see you."

379
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,280
You're coming, right?

380
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm busy today, so I can't make it.

381
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,650
Enjoy.

382
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,720
This means,

383
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,290
"Good start, but you aren't
stopping now, are you?"

384
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,930
And then...

385
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,600
The rest need no explanation.

Deliciously tasty?

396
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,460
Yes. I ate a lot.

397
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,730
So you're all powered up now.

398
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,000
Are your muscles popping?

399

They're popping!

400
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,940
Awesome.

401
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,840
You must be causing global warming.

402
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,910
You're so hot. You're on fire.

403
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,780
You didn't forget our plans
for this weekend, right?

404
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,420
For our matching couple stuff,

405
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,960
I got a new board
and new sunglasses.

406
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,200
- Ji Song, behind you.
- I got new underwear too.

407
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,800
- Behind your back.
- What else am I buying?

408
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
Feel like saying bye
to the company too?

409
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,900
Gosh, Mr. Song!

410
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,510

411
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,940
Did you finish organizing
this month's expense reports?

412
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,310
Oh, I'm almost finished with it.

413
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,150
Funny, you said "almost done"
three days ago.

414
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,120
Oh, right. Well, three days ago,
they were almost done.

415
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,850
But now it's really almost done.

416
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,590
There is a subtle difference.

417
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
You can grab the handle right here.

418
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,500
Look, whether they're "almost"
or "really almost" done,

419
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,800
it means you're not done, right?

420
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,600
- Are you messing with me right now?
- No, of course not.

before you leave today.

422

Mr. Cheon, did Ms. Eun Sang get
"average" for her review again?

427
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,690
It wasn't my call.

428
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,760
The decision came from up.

429
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,860
At this rate, she's going to quit.

430
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,670
And they won't even give our team
more people.

431
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,970
Just imagine if Ms. Eun Sang quits.
She does the work of ten people.

What's with her?

433
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,450

that she finally snapped.

Same here.

440
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,580
Let's just go get something to eat.
I have something to tell you anyway.

441

We'll eat, but reveal yours first.

- What did you get?
- Do you even have to ask?

The price went up.

528
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,740
It's so expensive!

529
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,740
- The owner's so mean.
- That'll be 7.8 dollars.

530
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,840
By card, please.

531
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,580
- That'll be 3.7 dollars.
- Can I get a stamp, please?

532
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,950
- That'll be 4.5 dollars.
- Extra whipping cream, please.

533
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,120
Are you the same people
who said the soup was too expensive?

534
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,320
You spend more than a meal on this
without a second thought.

535
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,900
This is our lifeblood.
We need this to survive the workday.

536
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,270
Come on. We don't do this every day.
It's just once or twice a week.

537
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,500
A little treat like this is fine.

538
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,100
What?

539
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,340
What's this? That's new, isn't it?

540
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,580
You noticed.

541
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,940
It's new this season. Cute, right?

542
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,950
Where do you get all that money?

543
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,650
New bags and shoes all the time.

544
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,120
- How do you afford it all?
- Well...

545
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,990
The bank is happy to lend it to me.
And Simin Bank helps out a lot.

546
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,390
Will you listen to her?

547
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,630
You've lost your mind.

548
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,500
I deserve a medal for not grabbing
Mr. Song's grubby hand...

549
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,770
and snapping it off.

550
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,440
That's why
I need sweets and to shop.

551
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,710
Or else I might slap my resignation
right on his forehead!

552
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,440
Right! Isn't today payday?

553
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,010
Right, I can't be quitting.
Not on payday.

554
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,050
(Salary has been deposited.)

555
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,180
(Paycheck, rent, Mom, loan,
cell phone, credit card, savings)

556
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,050
Darn it.

557
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,220
(Remaining balance:
Minus 764.470 dollars)

558
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,090
(Remaining balance:
Minus 1,410.32 dollars)

559
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,290
It's been a while.
Tell that jerk to come to our reunion.

560
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,030
Not pretty.

561
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,900
My bank balance
is not pretty at all.

562
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,070
I have to meet Wei Lin.

563
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,710
We were supposed to go snowboarding
in Pyeongchang.

564
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,450
You're still with Beijing Baby?
You haven't broken up?

565
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,710
Break up?

566
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,520
Our love is forever and ever, okay?

567
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,150
What do you know about love?

568
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,290
I don't know much about
unprofitable things like love,

569
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,120
but I do know about something else.

570
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,460
And what's that?

571
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,430
- It's called crypto.
- I know.

572
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,470
- You do?
- You mean like a karaoke booth?

573
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,140
- No, not a karaoke booth.
- Not a booth? Like a laundromat?

574
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,470
Not a coin laundromat.

575
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,580
That cryptocurrency stuff?

576
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,710
Cryptocurrency...

577
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,510
You mean like in-game money?

578
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,550
Seriously?
How can you compare it to game cash?

579
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,420
- Da Hae, what's wrong?
- Hey, I'm in the middle of talking.

580
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,660
Da Hae, what's up with you?

581
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,460
What?

582
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,430
It's nothing.

583
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,260
It's obviously not nothing.

584
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,030
So what's wrong?
What's on your mind?

585
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,270
No, it's not that.

586
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,040
Actually...

587
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,570
The truth is...

588
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,340
Byeong Jun...

589
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,080
Asked you to marry him?

590
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,250
- What?
- It's about that time, right?

591
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,710
Don't tell me he proposed.

592
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,420
- Oh, my gosh.
- No. Don't jump to conclusions.

593
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,690
Marriage? Are you kidding?

594
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,520
- It's not?
- I said, no.

595
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,730
And besides, I'm the type
who'd rather live together first.

596
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,400
So you're moving in together?

597
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,700
- Seriously. I said no.
- What is this?

598
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,740
- Why does she keep cutting me off?
- What?

599
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,840
- I have to go!
- What's going on?

600
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,610
- Hey, wait!
- What's gotten into her?

601
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,480
Come on!

602
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,210
- What is all this?
- Mr. Song.

603
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,920
- Is all of this yours, Ms. Kim?
- I meant to use my home address,

604
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,490
- but used the office address.
- What?

605
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,830
I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.

606
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,930
How could you be so...

607
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,800
Mr. Song! Are you okay?

608
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,770
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

609
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,770
Are you okay? Are you all right?

610
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,400
Ms. Kim Ji Song, seriously.

611
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,870
Oh, what am I going to do with you?

612
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,140
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

613
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,540
- What do I do?
- I'm leaving.

614
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,810
- Bye.
- Let me help you up.

615
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,180
A pain patch, Mr. Yoon.

616
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,550
- Does anyone have a patch?
- Gosh, my back.

617
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,750
Christmas is just around the corner,

618
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,850
and as we await the birth
of baby Jesus,

619
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,820
how about we all go grab a drink?
Let's go!

620
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,560
My parents are waiting for me.

621
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,960
My girlfriend's waiting for me.

622
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,090
My delivery driver is waiting.

623
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,700
I guess I'm the only one
waiting for baby Jesus.

624
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,600
If you don't want to go,
just say so.

625
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,040
Goodness.

626
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,000
Fine, then I'll go by myself.

627
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,410
See you all next week.

628
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,580
- Good work, everyone.
- Good work, everyone.

629
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,150
(My birthday)

630
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,090
Have a good weekend, Da Hae.

631
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,120
Oh, you too.

632
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,740
I'm out.

633
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,910
- I'm off?
- Okay. See you.

634
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,410
- Bye!
- Bye!

635
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,860
Is she gone?

636
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,860
- She's gone.
- She's gone. Let's go.

637
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,510
This is going to be fun.

638
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,840
The phone is turned off.

639
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,540
Please leave a message
after the tone.

640
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,310
You'll be charged after the tone.

641
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,250
(Honey)

642
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,030
Excuse me.

643
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,700
What?

644
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,770
It's my boyfriend.

645
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,640
He's gone missing.

646
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,440
Please, you have to find him.

647
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,850
It's fine. It's just one dish.

648
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,750
- You sure?
- Yes.

649
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,050
Hey, stop it.

650
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,060
What's with you? There you go again.

651
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,930
Hey! I'm trying to cook here!

652
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,460
I knew you'd do this.

653
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,090
No dinner for you.

654
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,860
Okay.

655
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,330
- Go open the wine, then.
- The wine?

656
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,900
- Yes.
- This one?

657
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,340
I'm almost done with this.

658
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,370
Where's the corkscrew?

659
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,580
Right. I forgot
I was supposed to buy one.

660
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,780
You can't open it
without one, can you?

661
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,280
I don't think so.
Hold on. I'll go get one real quick.

662
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,750
- Okay. See you soon.
- I'll be right back.

663
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,450
- Yes. Hurry back.
- Okay.

664
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,560
At first,

665
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,990
I thought
it was part of some surprise.

666
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,630
Tomorrow's my birthday.

667
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,330
I thought
if I just waited a little while,

668
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:30,570
he'd walk in with flowers and a cake
and go, "Ta-da! Surprise!"

669
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,710
But...

670
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,580
He didn't come back?

671
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,280
He didn't.
After an hour, he still wasn't back.

672
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,850
Then two hours,
and he still wasn't back.

673
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,750
That's when I got a bad feeling
that something was really wrong.

674
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,890
Excuse me, did you see a tall guy
come in to buy a corkscrew?

675
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,890
From then on,
I just kept looking for Byeong Jun.

676
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,760
The phone is turned off.

677
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,230
I went to the playground
where he'd go for smoke breaks,

678
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,570
and I even went to his place
to check, but...

679
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,330
Byeong Jun!

680
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,070
Lee Byeong Jun!

681
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,170
- Lee Byeong Jun!
- Gosh, it's so darn loud.

682
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,440
- Some of us are trying to sleep!
- Sorry.

683
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,150
But he wasn't there. Nowhere.

684
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,320
And then, my mind started going
to some pretty wild places.

685
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,620
Wild places? Like what?

686
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,030
It's not like he just shot up
into the sky,

687
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,960
so I thought maybe
he'd been swallowed by the earth.

688
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,060
Yes, like into a sinkhole.

689
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,040
You know in like disaster movies,

690
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,470
bridges collapse,
and people get trapped in buildings.

691
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,040
Disasters like that happen, right?

692
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,650
A sinkhole seems plausible,
don't you think?

693
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,580
(Screaming)

694
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,750
But I kept waiting,
and there was no word from MOLIT.

695
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,420
So you actually waited.

696
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,420
Then I even thought about calling
the Ministry of National Defense.

697
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,960
The Ministry of National Defense?
Why?

698
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,000
I figured it must be
their handiwork.

699
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,370
Aliens.

700
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,370
A UFO came down
and abducted Byeong Jun.

701
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,470
Help!

702
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,640
It's not completely impossible,
right?

703
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,280
I'm not so sure.

704
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,250
How about we stick to something
more plausible, shall we?

705
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,510
When he vanished,
did your boyfriend...

706
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,420
seem different than usual?

707
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,580
Was he going through a hard time?

708
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,450
Was there a situation
that might've upset him?

709
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,660
It was a pretty ordinary day.

710
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
That day...

711
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,390
That day...

712
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,600
If I have to pinpoint something,

713
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,570
when we were on our date
earlier that day,

714
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,670
I kept asking him
to turn on his hotspot.

715
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,340
I'm on a budget phone service,
and I'd used up all my data.

716
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,170
- Data. Got it.
- I was complaining about my boss...

717
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,740
I just kept trash-talking my boss.

718
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,380
So, I guess that might have
annoyed him a bit.

719
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,050
Also, after we ate,
I paid for our coffee, but...

720
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,990
I paid for it
with a handful of coins.

721
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,590
I didn't have enough
on my debit card.

722
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,460
What else?

723
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,630
There's more? All right.

724
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Well...

725
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,200
It's just that...

726
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,690
- What?
- What?

727
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,230
(Real Estate Monthly Rent Contract)

728
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,930
Oh, this?

729
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,630
It's almost time to renew my lease.

730
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,470
I should probably move.

731
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,700
And I should probably start thinking
about marriage too.

732
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,440
This lousy apartment.

733
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,080
And they have the nerve
to raise the rent.

734
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,420
The bathroom doesn't even have
a threshold.

735
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,350
Today, again,

736
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,820
I had to shower so fast,
worried the water would spill out.

737
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Why not use some waterproof tape?
Want me to do it?

738
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,200
No, it's fine.

739
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,730
It'll just peel right off anyway.

740
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,910
I'll just...

741
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,940
Gosh, I'm hungry.

742
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,310
Aren't you?

743
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,650
Should we grab a bite first?

744
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,580
Sure.

745
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,090
How about some wine?

746
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,490
Let's grill some eel to go with it.

747
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,560
It's cold, so we need a hearty meal.

748
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,160
Sounds good.

749
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,840
What's rent like
in your neighborhood?

750
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,440
It's whatever.

751
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,510
It seems like an easy commute
to work,

752
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,920
and with all the hospitals nearby,
it seems like a nice place to live.

753
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,290
You think so?

754
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,190
So,

755
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,230
I was wondering...

756
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,160
if I moved in with you...

757
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,530
I'm not proposing or anything.

758
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,800
It's just that if we lived together,

759
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,270
we could save on some expenses.

760
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,840
It doesn't have to be fancy
or anything.

761
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,880
We can keep it simple and low-key.

762
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,280
I mean, we can always get married
down the road.

763
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,580
What? There's no corkscrew.

764
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,220
Right. I forgot
I was supposed to buy one.

765
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,460
You can't open it without one,
can you?

766
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,630
I don't think so.

767
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,500
Hold on. I'll go get one real quick.

768
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,940
Oh, okay.

769
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,540
Hurry back.

770
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,090
He left,
and I never heard from him again.

771
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,190
As I was objectively laying out
my situation,

772
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,260
it dawned on me.

773
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,730
Byeong Jun was gone.

774
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,000
Because he didn't want to marry me.

775
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,640
That jerk.

776
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,740
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
That just slipped out.

777
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,510
No, it's okay.
That's actually comforting.

778
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,010
Oh, I shouldn't have...

779
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,750
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's just that...

780
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,990
You shouldn't waste valuable time
chasing after some deadbeat.

781
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,560
I'd like to withdraw my report.

782
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,330
Gosh. Wait. Miss.

783
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,770
Stay strong!

784
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,610
- Stay strong!
- Stay strong!

785
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,880
I will.

786
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,660
FYI, she likes whipped cream.

787
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,200
Sorry, my bad. Wrong chat.

788
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,530
I'm so sorry.

789
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,910
Thank you.

790
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,880
Hey. What if Da Hae finds out?

791
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,710
How could you post that
in the group chat?

792
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,350
No, I'm sure she didn't notice.
She's surprisingly oblivious.

793
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,820
Why'd you buy so much?

794
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:02,290
It was a buy two, get one free deal.
It'll be fun if we all use them!

795
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:07,030
- Come on, we're late. Let's go.
- Okay.

796
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:08,530
Give it here. I'll put it in my bag.

797
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,240
(My birthday)

798
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,790
(Happy birthday, Ms. Jung.
We'll give you a 20-percent discount...)

799
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,010
Gosh.

800
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
What?

801
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,520
- Da Hae.
- You...

802
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,300
What are you doing here?

803
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,210
I'm sorry, Da Hae. I was just...

804
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,840
too ashamed to face you.

805
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,280
Right.

806
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,310
You should be.

807
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,120
Showing up after what felt like
24 years.

808
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,980
No, that's not right.

809
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,390
- It's only been a day.
- Every hour felt like a year.

810
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,490
I'm so sorry. I'm really so sorry.

811
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,530
You should have said that yesterday.

812
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,870
You should have come back to me...

813
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:35,110
and said, "I don't love you enough
to marry you. I'm sorry."

814
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,710
You should've done all that
yesterday.

815
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,150
I'm sorry,
but please don't misunderstand me.

816
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,350
I do love you.

817
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,090
But the more I love you,

818
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,820
the more I'll just feel like
something's missing.

819
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:51,760
What?

820
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:53,730
I've thought about this a lot.

821
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,260
What would happen if we got married?

822
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,370
Would things still be this good?

823
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,300
Could we actually be happy?

824
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,600
But we're not going to make it.

825
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,040
And why wouldn't we?

826
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:09,140
We both came from nothing.

827
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,280
If we marry, we'll have to work
way harder just to get by.

828
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,420
- Do you think you can handle that?
- Hey!

829
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,480
Why not?

830
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,550
I have a job too.

831
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,620
You're a temp.

832
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,990
There's no room for advancement.

833
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,560
On your salary, can you even make
a dent in your student loans?

834
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,130
And what if you get pregnant
after we're married?

835
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,800
You'd be pressured into
quitting your job anyway.

836
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,370
How can we raise a kid on my income?

837
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,370
Stop it.

838
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,270
I'd have to kill myself working.

839
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,310
I said, stop it.

840
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,410
And even then,
we couldn't afford a place in Seoul.

841
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,480
Not even a decent home
where we could feel secure for once.

842
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,850
We'd just be scraping by,

843
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,650
slaving away like animals
until we retire.

844
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,090
Maybe that passes for
an "average" life to you.

845
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,750
Well, I'm so done with that life!

846
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,220
Gosh. Hey...

847
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,100
Goodness.

848
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,270
If you're going to say all that,

849
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,710
at least get me drunk first.

850
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,250
It's seriously hard to take in...

851
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,950
when I'm sober.

852
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:26,790
I'm really sorry, but...

853
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,130
Are you crying?

854
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,960
I'm not crying because of you.

855
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,860
I'm crying for me.

856
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,230
Because I'm so pathetic.

857
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,640
My life was so pitiful that I had
no choice but to fall for you.

858
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,210
Someone like you was the best
I could do.

859
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,750
My...

860
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,020
My life...

861
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,850
is just so pathetic.

862
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,260
Da Hae. Wait...

863
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,060
Move.

864
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,910
Surprise!

865
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,850
Happy birthday!

866
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,260
<i>- Happy birthday</i>
<i>- Happy birthday</i>

867
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,020
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

868
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,100
(Christmas Flea Market is Open!)

869
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,550
I've seen myself like this before.

870
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:43,820
Was it a dream?

871
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,330
Or was it a premonition
of this awful, repetitive reality?

872
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,530
Either way,

873
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,770
life is awful.

874
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,050
Come on out.

875
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:26,230
Gosh.

876
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,410
Gosh, stop smacking your lips.

877
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,250
You see,

878
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,290
- it's something I read somewhere.
- Yes?

879
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,690
I think they say a breakup is...

880
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,090
when it's time to part
and you just go your own way.

881
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,430
So as for who got the better deal...

882
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,700
I don't know, Jesus? Buddha?

883
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:01,170
Anyway, they say only
the Almighty knows. That...

884
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,740
Socrates, or was it Pilates?

885
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,870
- Anyway, one of them said it.
- What are you even talking about?

886
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,010
Hey.

887
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,840
How can you not recall a short line
and just stumble through it?

888
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,710
I just wanted to say
something to help.

889
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,420
She's crying so hard.

890
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,460
Da Hae.

891
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,030
Stop crying already!

892
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,560
Is this really worth crying over?

893
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,440
Should I do a happy dance
because it's all-out mayhem?

894
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,770
Don't waste your tears on that jerk.

895
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:40,470
Focus on something more productive.

896
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,540
Something that'll actually help you
in life.

897
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,110
Something more ambitious, you know?
Forward-thinking.

898
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,110
For example,
something like crypto...

899
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,450
This isn't right, Eun Sang.

900
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,450
Why do you keep interrupting me?

901
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,720
I just really feel like
I have to say this.

902
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,030
Are you serious?

903
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,670
Hey, honey. Yes, I just got done.

904
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:17,140
Well, it was a bit of a headache,

905
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,180
but I took care of it.

906
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,110
Should I meet you there?

907
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,120
See you in a bit. Love you.

908
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,120
That son of a...

909
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,490
I'm going to grab that jerk,

910
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:34,260
dunk him in the Han River
head, shoulders, knees, and toes...

911
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,000
and make suyuk out of him!
That jerk!

912
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,030
You jerk!

913
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,900
Gosh, why are you being so vicious?

914
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,540
Hey,
You share locations with him, right?

915
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,140
Track him down right now.

916
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,610
Well, he's had his phone turned off
this whole time.

917
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:55,720
But why?

918
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,120
Since everything's
all-out mayhem anyway,

919
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,760
let's go
do that happy dance for real.

920
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,420
What?

921
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,370
You know what?

922
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:17,440
The walk signal here stays on
for way more than a minute.

923
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,940
Really?

924
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,240
So?

925
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,910
What can we do with all that time?

926
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,220
What are you getting at?

927
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,490
What?

928
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,290
Your hair is so soft.

929
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,800
- What?
- And it smells really good.

930
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,770
- Hey, what is that?
- What? What's the problem?

931
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,830
Look over there.

932
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,920
("Red Flavor,"
sung and adapted by Averages)

933
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,430
(Lee Byeong Jun,
you're just so awful)

934
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,670
(You're all talk,
but you just keep showing off)

935
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,440
(Being with you is absolute torture)

936
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:27,310
(What makes you so cocky
when you've got nothing to show for it?)

937
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:30,980
(Your face looks like
a wad of chewed-up gum)

938
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,880
(No, that's an insult to the gum)

939
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,910
Change it.

940
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:38,650
(Then you should at least have
a good personality)

941
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,690
(Or be loaded, like you always say)

942
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,790
Money!

you're just so awful)

(You're totally awful
when you've got nothing to show for it)

947
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,440
You good-for-nothing!

948
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:06,910
Isn't that your name?

949
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,850
Yes, that's my name.

950
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,960
- Gosh!
- Hey!

951
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,170
The guy who hated
subway transfers...

952
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,440
- is quick with this transfer.
- Transfer?

953
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,370
- Hey, am I your rebound?
- No, that's not what this is.

954
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,640
- No, not even close.
- What?

955
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,280
A guy who couldn't get it up.
Do you call that a relationship?

956
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,520
- It was charity.
- Jung Da Hae! What did you say?

957
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,850
Speaking of which,

958
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,450
you know
the special meal you missed?

959
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,120
- What?
- I'll give it to you now.

960
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,190
Eat this!

961
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,330
- Sun Hwa!
- Hey!

962
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,670
- Gosh, that's cold.
- You think I'm the one losing out?

963
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,870
You weren't good enough
for me either, you jerk!

964
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:09,540
You go, girl! You go!
That was awesome.

965
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,120
Darn it...

966
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,490
Darn it!

967
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,400
No way.

968
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,370
(Bareun Snack's Sinsa Tteokbokki)

969
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,640
Is that the spicy flavor?

970
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,440
It was absurd.

971
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:44,880
What are you doing?
Now you just waltz in here...

972
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,450
and crash?

973
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,150
Just for tonight.

974
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:53,290
Why leave your fancy house
to cause trouble here all the time?

975
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,120
Where have I seen her before?

976
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,390
Who?

977
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:00,890
- A woman?
- A warrior.

978
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,530
With guts like that,
she's a total warrior.

979
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,830
What are you talking about?

980
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:14,810
Hey, did you guys see that?

981
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,850
- Hey.
- Darn, I should've recorded that.

982
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,120
That's hilarious.

983
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,120
Still, it's your birthday,
so we have to celebrate.

984
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,260
- Birthday party time.
- Yes!

985
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,130
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

986
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,130
Happy birthday.

987
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,600
Okay, make a wish.

988
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,140
A wish?
Just to live a normal, quiet life.

989
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,780
But my life is just so...

990
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,750
Why does it have to be so hard?

991
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:29,550
So, I'm not asking
for anything special.

992
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,780
This life is beyond saving.

993
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,750
It feels like a losing game already.

994
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,830
Let's all go home. It's cold.

995
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,030
Hey, wait!

996
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,730
- What about the cake?
- Wait for us.

997
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:47,370
- At least eat some before you go.
- Wait for us.

998
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,470
- Let's eat it before we go.
- Wait for us.

999
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,240
- Hey, we need to pack this up.
- Oh, the cake...

1000
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,370
Just put it all in here.

1001
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,990
You guys,
I need to tell you something.

1002
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,460
Oh, no. We're done for.

1003
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:13,230
What is it now?
Why do you always have to interrupt?

1004
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:16,700
No, look over there.
That's a shortcut.

1005
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,970
We have to go this way
if we want to catch the last train.

1006
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:23,970
Hey, wait up! Seriously.

1007
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:29,710
- Hey!
- Hey, be careful!

1008
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,010
Gosh, wait up!

1009
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,650
- Here, grab my hand.
- My gosh.

1010
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:37,220
Oh, my.

1011
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,250
Hold on!

1012
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:43,420
Hey! Ji Song! Gosh, seriously.

1013
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,460
Are you okay?

1014
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:50,930
Yes, I'm fine.
Why did you suddenly run off?

1015
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,900
- Gosh, seriously.
- Get up. Don't sit.

1016
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:56,800
- Hey...
- Careful.

1017
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:59,310
The last train. Hurry!

1018
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:08,610
Oh, no. The cake!

1019
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:12,150
Darn it! Nothing ever goes my way.

1020
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,220
Every single thing...

1021
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:17,890
is just completely ruined. Darn it!

1022
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,190
- It's not ruined!
- Gosh, you scared me!

1023
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,460
Why are you yelling?

1024
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,630
We have it too!

1025
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:27,500
What do you mean? What do we have?

1026
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,970
Something to turn this all around.

1027
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,670
Our ace in the hole!

1028
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,070
A shot?

1029
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:36,910
I've only ever been
on the receiving end.

1030
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:41,610
Even as this cruel world
kept knocking my teeth out,

1031
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:46,390
I believed this misery was my fate
because I had nothing.

1032
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,520
But now, Eun Sang is telling me...

1033
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:58,200
that we have a shot too.

1034
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:04,170
A knockout punch
to obliterate this painful reality.

1035
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,170
She's saying it's ours
for the taking.

1036
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,220
She's flying.

1037
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,860
She's flying?

1038
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,910
Guys, let's...

1039
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:49,080
Back then, I had no idea...

1040
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:50,880
that this moment...

1041
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,450
Let's get into crypto!

1042
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,820
would change our destinies.

1043
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,940
Just give me the chance.

1044
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,810
I'll be a dedicated Marron employee.

1045
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:17,180
Ms. Jung Da Hae.

1046
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,280
In three years,

1047
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,120
- how do you think you'll be living?
- Sorry?

1048
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,220
Your wish, so to speak?

1049
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:30,160
You have a vision
for your future, right?

1050
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:32,630
What do you think it'll be like
in three years?

1051
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,460
I just...

1052
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:39,130
want to live a normal, average life.

1053
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,970
Average...

1054
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:42,840
is boring.

1055
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:47,170
- I'm out of questions.
- What's "average" to you?

1056
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,140
Well, I'm not entirely sure,

1057
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:54,080
but a life
where you get immediate care...

1058
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:55,650
if you get stung by a bee?

1059
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,850
The truth is, right now,

1060
01:04:58,620 --> 01:04:59,990
I'm in a lot of pain.

1061
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:03,020
But I'm afraid that if I leave now,
I won't get the job.

1062
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,890
And if that happens,
starting next month,

1063
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,560
I'll be struggling to even pay
my health insurance.

1064
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,730
So, something that might seem
boringly obvious to someone else...

1065
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,600
is a matter of desperation for me.

1066
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,540
Right now,
my life feels pretty miserable.

1067
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:24,980
So, I hope that in three years,
I won't be like this anymore,

1068
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,350
so I can live that average life...

1069
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:30,550
where money
isn't making me miserable.

1070
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,290
So, couldn't you please
just hire me?

1071
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:35,450
So, if you just get the job,

1072
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,190
you think you'll be able
to live the life you want?

1073
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,330
Yes, of course.

1074
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,060
I'll be earning money.

1075
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:50,700
(To the Moon)

1076
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,630
Do you think I'm like you?
Blinded by a get-rich-quick fantasy?

1077
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:22,700
Do I look like the type of person
who'd get into crypto?

1078
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,770
I swore I wouldn't, but I bought it.

1079
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,710
Nothing ever goes my way.

1080
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,570
Not one single thing.

1081
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:29,940
Dr. Ham?

1082
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,680
Didn't you say you saw him
during your job interview?

1083
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,880
I doubt
he'd even remember me, though.

1084
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,920
I interviewed you
three years ago, right?

1085
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,490
So what if I like him?

1086
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,490
Is there some reason I can't?

1087
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,960
