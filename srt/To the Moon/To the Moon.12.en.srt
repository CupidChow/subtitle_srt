and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,980
What are you doing over there?

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,580
The view here is
absolutely incredible.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,420
Having some coffee with this view...

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,290
would be just perfect.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,130
Da Hee, you want to have coffee
with me at a time like this?

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,060
Why?

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,630
Don't you have any questions for me?

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,230
I just don't get it.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,770
Why on earth would Da Hee do that?

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,270
You know Assistant Manager Kwak
from the PR Team?

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,740
A friend of his used to work
at the same company as Da Hee.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,910
She also got caught
bashing people online back then.

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,950
It caused a huge uproar.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,780
I had no idea.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,150
I was saying no one's as tight-lipped
as our Da Hee,

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,350
and I told her all my secrets.

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,450
You think you're the only one,
Seung Jae?

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,820
Mr. Ko.

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,630
Why did she use "Hoppang" for an ID?

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,730
Not sliced, garlic, or pizza bread.
Why hoppang, of all things?

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,370
Is that what you're curious about?

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,340
You see, with hoppang,
a steamed bun,

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,810
you can't know its true flavor
with just one bite.

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,750
Because the red bean filling
is hidden deep inside.

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,850
I'm the same way.

29
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,650
If I smile and act all friendly
on the outside,

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,260
people just assume
that's all there is to me.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,120
Like a bunch of fools.

32
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,660
Are you calling those
who trusted you a fool right now?

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
That's just malicious.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,700
"Malicious?"

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,800
Then, since it's come to this,

36
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,110
how about I get truly malicious...

37
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,510
and tell you one more lie?

38
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,440
What?

39
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,810
I mean,

40
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,150
it's possible I had my own sob story
about why I had no other choice.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,760
For example, I'm a psychopath
who can't read people.

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,320
Shut it.

43
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,890
Or...

44
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,930
an alien who's here
to throw the world into chaos?

45
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,800
- Or if not that...
- Still talking, are we?

46
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,530
Or that I was abandoned
by my parents.

47
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,740
What?

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,240
- Does "sorry" fix everything?
- An abandoned kid.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,310
What will a child like that
amount to?

50
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,050
Who'd want a kid who wasn't sweet
and never smiled?

51
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,420
I was adopted
and sent back several times.

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,290
As I kept returning
to the orphanage,

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,360
I slowly started
to realize something.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,400
Oh, maybe...

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
the real me just wasn't good enough.

56
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,200
Who wears those these days?

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,510
I hoped things would be different
when I grew up, but...

58
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,010
- Seriously.
- I know, right?

59
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,210
Excuse me, I think that's my seat.

60
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,190
But it was exactly the same.

61
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,920
An office isn't
just a place for work.

62
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,160
You have to know how to get along
with people.

63
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,200
Especially a pretty girl like you.

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,930
Why are you like this?

65
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,330
That doubt I'd had
since I was a child...

66
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,570
- You got that, right?
- was confirmed...

67
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,100
when I started work.

68
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,970
- "So it's true."
- Yes.

69
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,840
"I shouldn't live as my true self."

70
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,040
From then on,

71
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,510
I lived my life as a Jung Da Hee
people would like.

72
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,680
Acting nice, acting sweet,
and always smiling.

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
- But at some point,
- Da Hee.

74
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,120
- it started to feel so unfair.
- About Mr. Lee...

75
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,830
He told people you two were a thing.

76
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,400
What? That's not true at all.

77
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,330
And you know Ji Min from
the Management Support Division?

78
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,130
Isn't she the worst?

79
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,400
- Did you see what she was wearing?
- I lived my life wearing a mask...

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,070
- She is so tactless.
- and hid who I was.

81
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,010
So when I see people living freely,
showing their true colors,

82
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,510
it's nauseating,
and it makes me angry.

83
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,290
So that's how I coped,
by letting off steam in my own way.

84
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,290
(What's wrong with that person
from the AE Team?)

85
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,660
It didn't actually
solve anything, though.

86
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,240
Besides, secrets don't stay secret
for long anyway.

87
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,880
When my cover was blown,
I'd just move to a new company,

88
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,010
over and over.

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,210
I repeated that same, tedious act.

90
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,280
Then one day, miraculously,
I met someone.

91
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,650
Someone just like me.

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,160
She was sitting
in a transparent chair,

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,630
and I was wearing
a transparent mask.

94
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,930
The way she tried so desperately
to fit in...

95
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,870
was so much like me.

96
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,670
I couldn't get her out of my head.

97
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,700
Da Hae.

98
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,870
But she just wouldn't
give me an opening.

99
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,610
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

100
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,780
I'd purposely get her Americanos,
knowing well she hated them.

101
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,250
Wait a minute.

102
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,510
You did that on purpose?

103
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,680
You knew I didn't like it,
and you did that on purpose?

104
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,890
Why?

105
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,560
So I'd have an excuse to apologize
and treat you to a meal.

106
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,760
Gosh, you're really messed up,
aren't you?

107
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,600
You should have just stayed
Ms. Round, a roly-poly, then.

108
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,130
What?

109
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,370
Just like what a roly-poly is
meant to do,

110
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,970
you should've rolled around
and gotten stuck in a corner.

111
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,710
Why did you
suddenly have to take flight?

112
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,110
When you do that,

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,980
it makes me want to lash out.

114
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,090
I feel like saying,
"You're no better than I am."

115
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,060
"Stop trying so hard
and just fall apart with me."

116
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,830
I just get this urge to rattle you.

117
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,100
Fall apart with you? How?

118
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,500
What was I supposed to do?
Post nasty comments with you online?

119
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,600
That would've been nice,

120
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,310
but do you think people
would've let you get away with it?

121
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,510
All those people who genuinely care
about you and love you.

122
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,410
Do you think they'd have stood by
and watched you fall apart?

123
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,650
Okay, I get it.

124
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,430
- I get it, okay? So come down...
- No.

125
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,900
If I go down now,

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,730
I'll have to smile...

127
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,100
and say it was all
a misunderstanding...

128
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,470
and lie all over again.

129
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,970
I don't want to do that anymore.

130
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,640
And I have no reason to.

00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,150

- What are you doing?

135
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,030
Let go of me!

136
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,830
Do you really need me to give you
a reason not to die?

Are you out of your mind?

144
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,440
I'd have to get my black clothes
dry-cleaned, just for you!

145

- Exactly!

146

By the way, Ji Hye,
did you check the delivery?

155
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,920
Yes, I checked it first thing
when I got in.

156
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,360
But I heard some items were missing.

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,510
Ji Song. About those copies
we talked about...

177
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,080
(Annual Leave Request Form)

178
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,680
Are you taking time off?

179
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,150
- Are you going somewhere?
- To China.

180
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,490
I have to do some field research.

181
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,230
Time off? Are you kidding?
We're slammed.

182
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,160
- What? But I...
- "But?"

183
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,960
Are you getting back
with your foreign boyfriend?

184
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,840
Why? Going to China
to get up to something again?

185
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
That's not it.
I have my own personal reasons...

186
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,970
Exactly!

187
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,710
We're busy right now,
so put in your request another time.

188
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,210
Yes, I understand.

189
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,590
So Ji Song didn't get
her time off, then?

190
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,630
Yes, she wanted to go to China
to learn to make tanghulu herself.

191
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,630
Since she couldn't go, she's decided
to practice on her own today.

192
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,730
Wait, but why on earth
is she practicing at the office?

193
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,900
Oh, my.

194
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,370
She said she burned a pot at home,
and you almost killed her.

195
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,580
Gosh, she completely scraped up
the bottom of the pot.

196
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,180
Goodness.

197
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,550
She's best buds with
the maintenance guy, you know.

198
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,350
He said it was fine
if she cleaned up afterward.

199
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,950
Gosh, she's got a long way to go.

200
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,560
Anyway, where are we going
right now?

201
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,720
We're not going far.

202
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,090
We're going to a karaoke bar.

203
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,000
- Karaoke?
- Yes.

204
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,670
<i>Oh, what a beautiful day</i>

205
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,880
<i>Even the sun and the moon</i>
<i>are on my side</i>

206
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,680
<i>Shining just for me</i>

207
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,250
<i>Oh, come...</i>

208
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,950
Hey, what's wrong?

209
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,290
Hey, we've only sung Dr. Ham's songs
for two hours.

210
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,820
Isn't that enough?

211
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,690
We got a perfect score 12 times!

212
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,830
Is that still not enough for you?

213
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,500
It's not enough.

214
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,930
It's not enough.

215
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,500
I need more of Dr. Ham.

216
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,510
Eun Sang,
I'm having such a hard time.

217
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,380
I miss Dr. Ham so much.

218
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,520
How do I get through this?
What do I do?

219
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,320
Do you...

220
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,260
want me to tell you
how to get over it?

221
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,720
Yes.

222
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,930
You have to accept it.

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,400
That you can't get over it.

224
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,370
What?

225
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,140
Did you think you could just skip
the pain and hardship,

226
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,010
like you're skipping an ad
on YouTube?

227
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,950
You have to take it all in,
with every fiber of your being.

228
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,650
You must endure that agonizing pain
and see it through.

229
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,820
And if you do that,
eventually, it might get a little...

230
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,830
Better?

231
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,000
I guess it gets better?

232
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,370
So does it get better or not?

233
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,970
I don't know.

234
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
Everyone says it'll get better.

235
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,610
But I'm not so sure.

236
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,810
I've never considered getting better
in the first place.

237
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,680
I've never even tried to,

238
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,480
so I'm still just...

239
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,020
living with one foot stuck
on the most painful day of my life.

240
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,100
What's that supposed to mean?

241
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,770
That's even more depressing!

242
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,670
Hey.

243
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,310
Fine. Go ahead and cry.

244
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,840
You need something left inside
to cry.

245
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,520
Let me know when you're done crying.

246
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,990
I'll brief you on our plan
for tomorrow.

247
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,760
A plan for tomorrow?

248
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,430
Why?

249
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,530
What are we doing?

250
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,230
Gosh, what is this piece of junk?

251
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,930
Stop calling it a piece of junk.

252
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,770
This thing cost me a pretty penny.

253
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,270
I think this is way worse
than the one we took to Namhae.

254
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,140
Come on!
Hey, the GPS works just fine.

255
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,350
Check this out.
The sunroof opens too!

256
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,250
Gosh, this is too much.
Close it already.

257
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,090
Come on, lighten up.

258
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,720
Isn't this a nice change of pace?

259
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,760
Did you see? Crypto's up again.

260
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,400
Yes. They updated the network,
and the price has been skyrocketing.

261
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,700
I'm going to sign the lease
for my shop right away.

262
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Hey, did you really do your research
on that shop?

263
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,870
I did, okay?

264
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,770
And I really want to quit my job.

265
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,740
I'm so sick of Mr. Song,
and Assistant Manager Oh...

266
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,280
- What about Assistant Manager Oh?
- What?

267
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,940
You know...

268
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,050
I've just got a lot on my mind.

269
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,450
So I figured
this was a good chance...

270
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,050
to get it together
and focus on work only.

271
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,150
Right, I believe in you, Ji Song.

272
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,960
You're a grown-up now, after all.

273
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,860
Come on. Of course.

274
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,430
I'm a grown-up, so dinner's on me.

275
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
So, where are we going anyway?

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,830
I told you I'd show you
the real deal...

277
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,030
when it came to country food,
didn't I?

278
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,740
A thistle rice set
with a view of the countryside.

279
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,770
- You have no idea how good it is.
- Thistle?

280
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,540
I wonder if thistle can really
cure my sorrow.

281
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,250
What? What's happening? Eun Sang!

282
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,280
- It's raining! Close it!
- Close the sunroof!

283
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,520
- What's wrong? Close it!
- Okay.

284
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,420
What? Why won't it work?

285
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,620
- Hurry!
- Why won't it close?

286
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,690
What? Hey, it's not working!

287
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,690
- Gosh!
- Eun Sang!

288
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Eun Sang!

289
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,030
Eun Sang!

290
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,670
What is going on with my hair?

291
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,470
- Help me see!
- Eun Sang, your hair!

292
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,870
Get my hair off my face!

293
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,040
What is all this?

294
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,210
I can't see, Ji Song!

295
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,040
Where are we even going?

296
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,360
- Eun Sang.
- Eun Sang, get in, quick.

297
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,200
- Goodness.
- How's the car?

298
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,970
I guess I can't do long deliveries
in this car.

299
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,430
- What do you mean? Deliveries?
- What?

300
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,770
The truth is,
I bought this car to earn money.

301
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,710
There's the errand center,
green juice delivery, or a taxi.

302
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,510
You can do so much with a car.

303
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,410
I can't just sit around idly
after quitting my job.

304
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,310
That figures.

305
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,020
You earn all that money
just to make even more money.

306
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,490
Good grief. What a mess.

307
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,490
- What?
- Eun Sang,

308
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,560
a fire truck's coming.

309
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,660
- What do I do? Should I back up?
- Yes.

310
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,470
What?

311
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,270
Oh, no, why aren't we moving?

312
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,710
- Why aren't we moving?
- It's not working?

313
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,480
- What are we going to do?
- We have a collision up ahead.

314
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,750
Please move your vehicle.

315
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,720
Yes, I'm trying to. Just a moment.

316
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,320
I'm having some trouble with it.

317
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,450
Hurry up!

318
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,960
Eun Sang!
Hey. Let's get out and push.

319
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,090
- Yes, go push with her.
- Okay, Eun Sang.

320
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Just a second!

321
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,600
- We're so sorry!
- Okay.

322
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,000
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

323
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,930
Push! Are you guys pushing?

324
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,470
Are you pushing?

325
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,710
Eun Sang, I don't think
this is going to work!

326
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,010
- What do you mean?
- What's wrong with this?

327
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
What is it?

328
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,220
- Hurry up!
- Did a wheel fall off or something?

329
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,290
- We're so sorry!
- One, two, three!

330
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,390
Command vehicle en route.
Eight kids in the overturned bus.

331
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,400
Eun Sang. I think children were
in an accident.

332
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,700
Mom.

333
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,070
A daycare shuttle bus
driving on a rainy road...

334
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,640
has crashed into a guardrail
on a street in Seoul.

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,270
Four people were injured
in the crash,

336
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,140
and a five-year-old girl has died.

337
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,250
The child was rushed to the hospital
in cardiac arrest after the crash,

338
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,580
but she tragically passed away.

339
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,660
- Just go.
- Excuse me?

340
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,030
Just strike my car and go.

341
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,750
What are we going to do, Eun Sang?

342
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,860
At 1 p.m. today in Gochon-eup,
Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province,

343
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,730
a daycare bus that was
on its way to an event...

344
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,960
tragically overturned.

345
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,300
Following the report,
firefighters...

346
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,430
were quickly dispatched to the scene
and began rescue operations.

347
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,970
Fortunately, all passengers
were rescued safely...

348
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,940
and taken to a nearby hospital.

349
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,880
Onboard the vehicle during the crash
were eight daycare children...

350
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,280
- Seems no one was seriously hurt.
- What a relief.

351
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,950
I almost had a heart attack.

352
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,050
The undercarriage is
totally wrecked.

353
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,820
The muffler's badly corroded too.

354
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,250
Nothing here is worth salvaging.

355
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,290
If you keep driving it,
it will be trouble on the highway.

356
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,160
So it's better to stop now...

357
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,390
than on the highway, right?

358
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,030
Let's junk it.

359
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,460
- Okay.
- What?

360
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,330
Are you serious?

361
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,770
Wait.
Didn't you spend a fortune on this?

362
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,770
Are you sure about this?

363
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,510
Of course I am.

364
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,480
Actually, it's better than okay.

365
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,380
Hey, guys.

366
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,420
I'm finally calling it quits.

367
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,850
- What?
- What?

368
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,250
Just like that car,

369
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,690
I think it's time for me
to stop too.

370
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,360
Just because I made money...

371
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,860
doesn't mean life
will only be full of joy, right?

372
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,170
There will still be times of sadness
and times of anger.

373
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,610
But what's important
is what we choose to focus on...

374
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,210
and the choices we make,
don't you think?

375
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,710
And rather than just keep going,

376
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,450
I'm choosing to stop here.

377
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,660
I want to rest now.
I think I've earned it.

378
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,460
What are you two going to do?

379
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,530
Ms. Kim Ji Song.

380
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,170
I told you not to take days off,
but I see you did it anyway.

381
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,410
Yes.

382
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,240
The Labor Standards Act guarantees
employees the right to annual leave.

383
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,420
What, "employees?" "Rights?"

384
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,080
Ms. Kim Ji Song,

385
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,520
what do you know?

386
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,690
You think you're a legal expert?

387
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,090
You think you know the law?

388
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,220
Keep it up.

389
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,190
I may not know the law,
but the lawyer I'll hire will.

390
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,360
What?

391
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,300
I've avoided you all this time.
Not out of fear, but out of disgust.

392
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,500
But after some thought,

393
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,710
scary or disgusting,
I shouldn't be avoiding it anymore.

394
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,410
If something is disgusting,

395
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,680
I should just throw it in the trash.

396
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,980
"Trash?"

397
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,920
"Trash?"

398
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,320
Are you calling me trash right now?

399
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,890
(Letter of resignation)

400
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,860
Oh, my. That was so cool.

401
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,370
Ms. Kim Ji Song.

402
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Are you crazy?

403
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,670
Me? Why do you ask?

404
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,640
You power-trip and deny me the leave
I'm entitled to, which is absurd.

405
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,510
You verbally abuse me with nonsense,

406
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,380
and you're always
disgustingly touchy.

407
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,650
Aren't you the crazy one, Mr. Song?

408
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,620
Now that I'm quitting,

409
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,190
I won't have to call you
Mr. Song anymore.

410
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,120
Mister.

411
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,130
"Mister?"

412
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,030
"Mister?"
You've really lost it, haven't you?

413
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,360
Mr. Song!

414
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,200
- Sir, please don't...
- That hurts! Let me go!

415
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,600
Hey, who do you think you are?

416
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,300
Are you crazy?

417
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,810
I go easy on you people,
and this is what I get. Darn it.

418
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,680
What was that?
Why are you interfering?

419
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,880
Ji Song, are you really quitting?

420
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,750
Was that your resignation letter
you threw at him?

421
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,750
You defended me without knowing?

422
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm fine since I'm quitting,
but what about you, Mr. Oh?

423
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,920
Don't worry about me.

424
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,590
And you deserved to be defended.

425
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,530
Why shouldn't you get your days off?

426
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,830
Plus, at the end of last month,
you pulled all-nighters by yourself.

427
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,400
And you were also the one who fixed
the accounting mistake yourself.

428
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,140
I really hate the thought
of you quitting.

429
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
But still, Ji Song,

430
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,250
you have every right
to do whatever you want.

431
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,350
Look down.

432
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,220
What? Okay.

433
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,630
I'm about to start a business
relying only on my gut feeling.

434
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,900
So what am I supposed to do
if my gut keeps being so wrong?

435
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,830
What do you mean,
your gut was wrong?

436
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,600
I didn't think I'd get butterflies!

437
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Never did I think...

438
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,080
I'd get butterflies for you, Mr. Oh.

439
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,850
But you keep making my heart race,
and acting like this...

440
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,420
What am I supposed to do?

441
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,730
(Jung Da Hee)

442
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,630
It's a shame
I have to leave so suddenly.

443
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,700
You're just giving us the creeps.

444
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,670
There was a bit
of an unfortunate incident,

445
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,910
and I regret leaving without
clearing up the misunderstanding.

446
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,310
But being able to work
with all of you...

447
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,110
was a true pleasure.

448
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,750
Well then, I'll be taking my leave.

449
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,770
Well, this is awkward.

450
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,110
I thought I gave...

451
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,740
a pretty moving speech back then.

452
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,080
It's amazing
how little you've changed.

453
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,980
I wonder...

454
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,190
- what you were expecting.
- Gosh.

455
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,060
Here, just take this.

456
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,130
About the snack subscription box...

457
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,000
You're aware there's still room
for improvement, right?

458
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,100
You're going to have to work
a lot harder.

459
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,410
Darn it.

460
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,550
I've compiled the handover materials
into this file for you.

461
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,120
It has everything from A to Z,

462
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,460
so just check here
if you get confused.

463
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,160
Okay, thank you.

464
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,190
(3rd floor meeting room,
12th floor hallway)

465
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,300
If you time it right, you can get
about ten minutes alone.

466
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,700
No, wait. You can rest
for about 20 minutes there.

467
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,100
When you're working hard
and feel worn out,

468
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,540
you should go to one of these places
and take a break.

469
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,810
I never rested when I was tired,

470
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,780
and I never cried when I was sad,

471
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,780
so it felt like
something inside me just broke.

472
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,190
Don't you be like that, Ji Hye.
All right?

473
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,790
Take time to cry and rest.
Pace yourself.

474
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,290
That's how you last in the long run.

475
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Okay.

476
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Eun Sang.

477
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,000
Come on, why are you all crying...

478
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,570
like it's the end of the world?

479
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,310
Come on, everyone. Chin up.

480
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,810
- Have grit! You must...
- Eun Sang...

481
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,280
Don't just live by being tough
all the time.

482
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,920
If you ever feel like
having a stiff drink,

483
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,590
call me anytime. Got it?

484
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,720
No, really. Please do call.

485
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,930
Eun Sang.

486
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,530
Okay.

487
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,830
- What?
- About this promotion,

488
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,600
they backed HR's Team Leader Choi.

489
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,210
No, but they promised I was next.

490
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,770
Mr. Choi has a widowed mother.

491
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,210
He's also got four kids.

492
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,950
And he also went to the same school
as Director Kim.

493
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,620
As for you, Mr. Ko,

494
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,590
let's aim for the next one.
All right?

495
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,060
This is driving me crazy.

496
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,160
What am I going to tell her?

497
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,200
(Honey, I'm just joking,)

498
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,540
(but what if I quit my job
and opened a cafe?)

499
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,180
Should I get into crypto
or something?

500
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,850
Oh, gosh.

501
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,650
I'm so baffled and speechless!

502
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
What kind of psycho brat
throws a resignation letter...

503
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,190
in her superior's face?

504
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,190
And when did I ever even touch her?

505
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,760
If her superior treats her nicely,

506
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,330
she should know how to be grateful.

507
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,900
How dare she be arrogant
for someone in her position!

508
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,870
Just because
she made some money off crypto,

509
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,340
she thinks she's hot stuff.

510
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,410
Kids these days.
They have no darn manners.

511
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,710
But what's with you,
just sitting there like that?

512
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,750
Now that Eun Sang is gone,

513
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,480
my future looks bleak and scary.

514
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,660
But you didn't actually
touch her, did you?

515
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,460
I barely grazed her.

516
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
Hey!

517
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,960
- Goodness!
- You are a real jerk, aren't you?

518
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,730
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

519
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,200
I couldn't stand
hearing about crypto...

520
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,370
and about
pursuing self-actualization...

521
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,770
while they messed around at work.

522
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,810
But you're a jerk.

523
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,970
I'd do the same thing
in her shoes...

524
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,540
with this bad company
and an even more terrible superior.

525
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,350
If even I feel this way,
can you imagine how they feel?

526
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,180
- No wonder they want to leave.
- Hey!

527
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,250
What? You got a problem?

528
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,820
Why should I understand
their feelings...

529
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,650
because of a jerk like you?

530
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,030
Why can't I be the grumpy old boss
in peace because of you?

531
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,090
Darn it!

532
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,530
Why you little...

533
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,700
Hey, Ko Dae Young.
Hey, where are you...

534
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,270
Hey, what's his problem?

535
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,310
- Does he not want to work here?
- I guess so?

536
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,410
- Unbelievable.
- I wonder why.

537
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,680
I like working here, though.

538
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,850
Only if it weren't for
old-school guys like you.

539
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,450
Hey!

540
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,290
Hey!

541
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,900
Do I really have to be here
this late on the day I quit?

542
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,570
I'm so sick of this.

543
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,470
What can we do? We had to work late.

544
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,600
All right!

545
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,670
Let's all say a few words
before the big moment.

546
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,140
Well, about that...

547
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,980
Can a few words even cover it?

548
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,910
We have it too!

549
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,520
Something to turn this all around.

550
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,750
Our ace in the hole!

551
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,550
I can't bear to watch...

552
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,260
you two collapse.

553
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,760
I won't let that happen to you two!

554
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,430
- Oh, my.
- Let's go! To the moon!

555
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,660
- To the moon!
- Let's go! To the moon!

556
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,460
Get ready. Let's do this.

557
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,830
(Your buy order has been
successfully placed.)

558
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:10,770
I'm going to be with you guys
until the very end.

559
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,540
Then let's go all the way.

560
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,080
- Let's keep going!
- Let's keep going!

561
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,510
But if I had to leave
one last thought,

562
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,950
I...

563
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,050
I'm free!

564
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,220
Let's do it.

565
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,920
(Enderion, Confirm Sell?)

566
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,990
(Your sell order has been
successfully placed.)

567
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,760
Good job, Jung Da Hae.

568
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,130
(Enderion, Confirm Sell?)

569
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,130
(Your sell order has been
successfully placed.)

570
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,010
Kang Eun Sang,
you've worked hard too!

571
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,710
(Enderion, Confirm Sell?)

572
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
(Your sell order has been
successfully placed.)

573
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,380
Kim Ji Song, you did great too!

574
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,890
And at this very moment...

575
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,460
Ta-da!

576
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,060
- Student loans paid off!
- Gosh, no more debt!

577
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,260
Congratulations!

578
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,300
No, we're the ones
who should be thanking you.

579
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,700
We owe it all to you.

580
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
What?

581
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,800
For giving me a life...

582
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,710
I never could have imagined
or even dared to dream of.

583
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,780
And for
pulling me into this grand story.

584
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,810
Thank you for everything, Eun Sang.

585
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Me too.

586
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,390
I'm incredibly grateful, Eun Sang!
No, scratch that. I love you.

587
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,060
Me too! I love you, Kang Eun Sang!

588
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,330
You guys. This is so cheesy. Stop.

589
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,260
Hey. Get off me.

590
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,270
Goodness.

591
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,670
- What's that?
- Looks like there's a festival.

592
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,840
There's that university
nearby, right?

593
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,310
It's perfect.

594
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,380
It's absolutely beautiful.

595
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,110
Everyone!

596
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,480
It's a beautiful night!

597
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,120
Right, I quit my job.

598
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,830
I can sleep in.

599
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,350
In the void,

600
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,720
where the numbers and goals
that once filled her life...

601
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,150
used to be,

602
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,860
a moment of mourning
found its way in.

603
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,710
It was like she was finally learning
how to truly cry.

604
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,650
She cried endlessly.

605
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,920
She cried her heart out.

606
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,840
Da Hae!

607
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,470
Da Hae?

608
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,380
Hey.

609
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,810
Where's Eun Sang?

610
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,450
She left.

611
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,650
What?

612
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,110
(I'll be back after I cry.)

613
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,180
Just how much
does she plan on crying?

614
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,420
So, you have no idea where she went?

615
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,850
No.

616
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,220
But...

617
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,790
let's just give her some space.

618
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,560
Let her cry her heart out.

619
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,100
What about you?
What happened with that deposit?

620
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,340
You can't get it back?

621
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,170
Well...

622
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,610
I'll just have to chalk it up
as an expensive life lesson.

623
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,180
Ji Song had been scammed.

624
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,880
The place Ji Song put a deposit on
was a fraudulent listing.

625
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,280
Even though it must have been
a devastating blow,

626
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,420
- I can't believe she just left.
- Ji Song no longer lets...

627
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,790
one setback keep her down for long.

628
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,490
Look at this.

629
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,260
Are you really okay?

630
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,230
I have to just shake it off.

631
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,600
Plus, I've already got my eye
on a new place.

632
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:42,770
Gosh, our Ji Song is
all grown up now.

633
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,540
Are you going right now?

634
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,110
What are you going to do there?

635
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,910
And then there was me.

636
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,530
This is always a good sight.

637
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,560
Well, it would've been nicer
with him.

638
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,740
Will you...

639
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
marry me?

640
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,490
I miss you.

641
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,930
I miss you.

642
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,180
July 20, 1969.

643
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,780
The historic moment when Apollo 11
made the 1st manned moon landing.

644
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,920
But maybe the real story
is what happened after the landing.

645
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,790
(1 year later)

646
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,060
After all, just getting to the moon
wasn't the end of the journey.

647
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,730
What path you should take next,

648
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
and what direction
you're currently facing.

649
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,030
That's what's more important.

650
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,670
But that's something that's hard
to figure out on your own.

651
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,970
After all, Apollo 11 was in
constant communication with Earth,

652
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,010
which was how it was able to
land safely on the moon,

653
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,080
and how the world could see
that moment as it happened.

654
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,250
Isn't communication about learning
where you're both headed...

655
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,990
and gradually aligning your paths
so you can walk forward together?

656
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,590
Here are some more examples...

657
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,930
of why workplace
communication matters.

658
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,500
(Diamond Tanghulu)

659
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,000
(Diamond Tanghulu:
Sweetness Crystallized)

660
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,940
(Tangerine, 2 dollars
Whole Jeju tangerine, 4.5 dollars)

661
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,820
(Kang Eun Sang:
Customers in, sales out)

662
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,150
(Jung Da Hae: I guarantee
this place is good.)

663
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,190
Ms. Kim,
your mango tanghulu is ready.

664
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,360
Thank you.

665
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,830
Seriously, boss, how did you know
the shop would do so well?

666
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,070
You just have good instincts?

667
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,700
I've had my moments.

668
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,370
Back then, trusting my instincts
was all I really had going for me.

669
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,340
I guess that's why
I was so obsessed with it.

670
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,250
I guess you could say it felt like
my greatest weapon back then.

671
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,280
- And not anymore?
- Gosh, of course not.

672
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,650
Now, I'm my own greatest weapon.

673
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,190
Just you wait.

674
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,360
Tanghulu will be even bigger soon.

675
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,530
And you know why?

676
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,030
Because I'm going to make it happen.

677
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,260
I sure hope so.

678
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,770
The landlord here is giving you
a great deal on the rent.

679
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,710
- This is how you'll get rich.
- Stop.

680
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,940
I appreciate it.

681
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,610
Mom, here.

682
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,310
I got you something for the season.

683
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,510
This color looks great on you.

684
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,320
You shouldn't have.

685
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,320
Thank you. I'll wear it often.

686
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,220
Right. And also,
Ji Song packed these just for you.

687
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,960
It's strawberry and grape tanghulu.

688
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,660
But she runs a business.
Is it okay to give freebies?

689
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,530
Thank her for me. I'll enjoy them.

690
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,560
Right. And this is for you, Dad.

691
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,630
For me? What is it?

692
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,640
I look good in any color,

693
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,170
and I like tomato just as much
as strawberry or grape.

694
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,640
It's your phone bill.

695
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,450
I see.

696
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,620
Of course. I should pay it.

697
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,720
Excuse me for a second.

698
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,130
Don't be so hard on him.

699
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,970
Like it or not, we live together.

700
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,270
When he's hunched over and moping,

701
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,140
do you have any idea
how much that gets on my nerves?

702
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
What did I do?

703
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,280
Still, it's not like
your father is a complete failure.

704
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,350
Name one thing he's done right.

705
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,780
For one thing, your father...

706
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,620
He has never done drugs.

707
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,250
And he's never murdered anyone.

708
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,260
Gosh, just stop.

709
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,630
Lately,

710
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,160
it looks like
he's been studying stocks.

711
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,630
Another one of his useless schemes.

712
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,970
Tell him to get a real job
if he wants to support himself.

713
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,870
And you? Is making a living
the only reason you work?

714
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,570
Mom, whose side are you on?

715
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,980
I'm not taking sides.

716
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,080
We're all
in the same miserable boat.

717
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,220
See you.

718
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,490
What?

719
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,890
Are you leaving already?

720
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,390
Look, I bought ice cream.

721
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,300
- What am I, a kid?
- Goodness.

722
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,000
Come on, I even got yours in a cone.

723
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,500
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

724
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,410
He doesn't commit murder.
He doesn't do drugs.

725
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,110
And he buys his daughter's ice cream
in a cone.

726
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,640
What are you talking about?

727
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,780
You make it impossible
not to be a good daughter.

728
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
What's this?

729
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,820
Investment money.

730
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,490
What?

731
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,990
Didn't you say there was something
you wanted to do?

732
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,060
From what I can tell,

733
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,140
you're just not the type of person
to ever find a four-leaf clover.

734
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,200
You were born with terrible luck.

735
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,410
Yet, you have all these ambitions,
wanting to do this and that.

736
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,110
But who can blame you for that?

737
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,980
I was the same way.

738
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,590
So, just this once,
trust me and take a leap of faith.

739
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,130
Just this one time,

740
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,530
I'll be your good luck.

741
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,070
Da Hae.

742
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:25,340
But don't get in over your head.
Only go as far as you can manage.

743
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,610
Please.

744
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,880
Hey, this time's different.
I really did my homework.

745
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,210
I looked through the reports
and followed the earnings.

746
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,620
I even watched the CEO interviews.

747
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,550
What's the company's name?

748
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,460
You know.

749
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,260
Mask? Is it Elon Musk?

750
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,360
The one that guy runs.

751
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:53,200
Mark my words,
the age of electric cars is coming.

752
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,240
I'm telling you, this is the one.

753
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,340
Please. Like I'd believe you.

754
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,970
You can laugh all you want,
but this is the real deal.

755
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,110
You always say, "This is it."

756
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:06,180
No, I thought it was real back then,
but I really studied this one.

757
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,980
- This one...
- You said you studied then too.

758
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,020
Look, when it rains,
the ground gets wet.

759
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,120
- So?
- It's just like that.

760
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,650
- It's a sure thing.
- This is hopeless. Give it back!

761
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

762
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,130
That was a request from Lee Ju Ah
from Gwanak-gu.

763
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,230
We just enjoyed the song
by Ham Ji Woo.

764
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,100
Now, some of you
might already know this,

765
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,340
but he's an artist active
in the English-speaking world.

766
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,710
He's been getting quite popular
here in Korea lately too.

767
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,980
He did an interview a while back.

768
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,580
It was pretty interesting.

769
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,850
"I don't want to make music
to comfort people."

770
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,590
"I just hope people's lives
aren't so difficult..."

771
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,490
"or lonely that they'd need
to be comforted."

772
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,520
"For people's best,
happiest moments,"

773
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,160
"I just want to make music
that's like a celebration."

774
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,760
"You think my songs are too mellow?"

775
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,070
"You don't think I won't make much
in royalties?"

776
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,370
"Don't worry about it."

777
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:04,870
"When I had a corporate job,
I saved up plenty of bonus money,"

778
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,070
"so it's okay."

779
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,980
"So, everyone, be happy."

780
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,210
"Make sure to be happy."

781
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,350
He's a fun guy, isn't he?

782
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,320
I hear he'll have
a show in Korea soon.

783
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,320
I should probably go check it out.

784
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,590
(Jung Da Hee)

785
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,830
Looks like your ex has a concert
coming up.

786
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,630
(Mobile ticket)

787
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,100
(Ham Ji Woo, "With You")

788
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,970
My ex?

789
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,570
I said, tuna.

790
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,410
Sashimi? Yes, tuna.

791
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,050
So, in our dressing room,
you must have it set up.

792
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,950
That's a requirement to book us.

793
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,120
Yes, but sorry about this time.

794
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,420
Right now, we are already in Korea.

795
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,990
Next time you invite us again,

796
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,190
we would be very thankful.

797
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,500
So, for the detailed schedule,
we can touch base nearer the date.

798
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,500
And the performance fee...

799
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,940
Please make sure the event fee is...

800
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,870
clearly stated
in the contract in advance.

801
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,510
I would appreciate it
if the payment could be completed...

802
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,010
within one week of the performance.

803
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,310
Any additional documents
will be sent through the label.

804
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,750
Okay, bye.

805
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,820
How are you suddenly so fluent...

806
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,190
when talking about
the performance fee?

807
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,250
Shut it.

808
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,790
Seriously, for a 200-seat theater,

809
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,490
you think it's wise to give up a gig
in Manchester?

810
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,500
Why does the venue's size matter?
It's the meaning that counts.

811
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,500
No, I mean, the "meaning..."

812
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,370
Let me explain this to you again.

813
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,400
If you two haven't talked in a year,

814
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,570
that means you broke up.

815
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,370
We, as a society,
have agreed to call that a breakup.

816
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,770
Oh, come on.

817
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,710
I just came to Korea
to perform for a good cause.

818
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,910
I'll get fans here...

819
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,410
and donate the profit.
Isn't that great?

820
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,080
You look like you need donations.

821
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,320
How can you wear flip-flops
all year?

822
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,220
I'm telling you, my feet hurt.

823
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,690
I can't wear dress shoes.

824
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,560
Right. I'm sure they hurt.

825
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,200
You're probably still hurting. Yes.

826
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,100
Please, just leave it.
I can do it myself.

827
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,870
Oh, no, it's okay.
This is too heavy for you, Ji Song.

828
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,140
I can handle it.

829
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,470
You must be so busy with work,
but you always help me like this.

830
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,540
It's good exercise.

831
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,080
And I kind of enjoy it.

832
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
Sorry, we're closed...

833
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,220
Ji Song.

834
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,950
Wei Lin?

835
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,560
What are you doing here?

836
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,330
I came to see you, Ji Song,
and to check out your shop.

837
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,540
Kind of like
killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

838
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,400
"Killing 2 birds with 1 stone?"

839
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,870
Where did you learn
a phrase like that?

840
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:57,040
You're the one who said
my Korean wasn't very good.

841
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:58,880
So I've been studying.

842
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,150
Good for you.

843
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,220
A good-looking foreigner like you
who also speaks Korean well?

844
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,990
That's a killer combination.

845
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,090
So cute.

846
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:11,590
If you have some free time,
could you be my tour guide?

847
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,860
- I've been wanting to see Namsan.
- A tour guide?

848
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,800
Of course. From Namsan
to K-barbecue pork belly,

849
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,670
I'll give you a full-course tour.

850
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,440
I like pork belly too.

851
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,770
Mr. Oh, did you say something?

852
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,710
What? Nothing.

853
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,510
The trash. I said
I'm going to take out the trash.

854
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,480
No, it's...
I said we'd do it together later.

855
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,750
- Oh, no, it's fine.
- Ji Song.

856
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,620
If you're ever having a hard time,
you have to call me.

857
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,390
We're close enough for that.

858
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,060
We're friends, after all.

859
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,660
Okay.

860
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,570
Mr. Oh!

861
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,870
I said we should do it together.

862
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,880
No, I'm fine. Why did you come out?

863
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,950
- Let me...
- Oh, no, it's okay.

864
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,010
Still,

865
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:08,720
thank you.

866
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,590
Isn't Wei Lin waiting for you?

867
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,860
He left.

868
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:17,890
He left?

869
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,000
Couldn't he stay a bit longer?
Why was he in such a rush?

870
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,330
He has his own life.
I guess he had other plans.

871
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,440
What plans could be more important
than seeing you, Ji Song?

872
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,040
And what's this about him
having his own life?

873
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,940
Excuse me?

874
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,450
Ji Song.
I'm no longer an assistant manager.

875
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:45,490
I'm a team leader now.

876
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,390
Mr. Song resigned recently,

877
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,190
so I got promoted.
I'm Team Leader Oh now.

878
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,860
Really?
Why are you only telling me now?

879
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,060
Remember a while ago...

880
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,160
when I couldn't come
to the shop for three days?

881
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,600
I was getting a gallstone removed.

882
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,400
I had a big polyp right here.

883
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,970
What? Why didn't you tell me?
Are you okay now?

884
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,400
- And there's more.
- More?

885
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,770
What else is there?

886
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,040
Of course.

887
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,180
I have a life of my own too.

888
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,280
It's just not that important.

889
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,080
I know this is going
to sound ridiculous,

890
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,650
but no matter how much
I think about it,

891
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,990
for me,

892
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,890
nothing is more important than you.

893
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,560
I don't even need a private life.

894
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,330
In my life,

895
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,330
there's nothing I want...

896
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,100
to be as devoted to as you.

897
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,570
That's why I...

898
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,450
Darn it.

899
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,750
What is it? What's wrong?

900
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,420
- What?
- I just feel so...

901
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,390
- so pathetic.
- What?

902
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:01,160
I know very well that I can't
compare to a great guy like Wei Lin.

903
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,200
Yet, here I am
making this lame confession...

904
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,630
- to try to win your heart.
- A confession?

905
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,900
Wait, if we're already dating,
why would we need a confession?

906
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,670
- What?
- What?

907
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,170
- What?
- What?

908
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,140
Wait. We're date...

909
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,380
We're dating...

910
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,110
Are we dating?

911
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,920
You mean we haven't been?

912
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,690
- What?
- What?

913
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,530
Then why do you think I said that
a year ago?

914
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,960
Never did I think...

915
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,500
I'd get butterflies for you, Mr. Oh.

916
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,570
Well...

917
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
So that...

918
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,470
So that meant...

919
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,010
- Mr. Oh!
- Gosh. Yes?

920
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,810
What were we this whole time?

921
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:52,910
Then,

922
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,410
what were you doing all this time?

923
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:55,780
If we weren't even dating,

924
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,050
why were you helping at the shop?

925
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,320
Why'd you walk me home every day?

926
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,990
That's because...

927
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,250
That's because...

928
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,860
No, but even so,
that doesn't mean we were dating...

929
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,530
That's not what dating is, is it?

930
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,100
I've never even held your hand.

931
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,570
That's because
I figured that was just you.

932
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,070
I figured you were
taking things slow.

933
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,940
Then hold my hand now.

934
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,480
Wait.

935
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,980
I've never even hugged you.

936
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:30,720
Then hug me now.

937
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,720
And...

938
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,660
there's still...

939
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,460
one more thing we haven't done.

940
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,800
What?

941
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,110
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.
What am I even doing?

942
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:58,910
Oh, my.

943
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,250
Are you crying?

944
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,050
No, don't cry. This isn't the time.

945
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,590
If you cry, I'm leaving.

946
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,590
- I'm going to leave!
- No.

947
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,930
Of course not.

948
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,570
I'm not that...

949
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:25,970
pathetic.

951
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,010

Jung Da Hae.
You have more than I do.

983
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,540
So don't avoid me.

984
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,910
So now you're being punished.

985
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,250
You, Dr. Ham,

986
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,780
dreaming of you is a special treat
I have to save up for these days.

987
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:03,420
Will you marry me?

988
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,650
So, what did you think?

989
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,190
I thought it was even better live
than the studio version.

990
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,160
Well, yes. I liked it.

991
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,790
If you did,
why didn't you get married?

992
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,230
Excuse me?

993
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,170
I was so curious to see
what you looked like.

994
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,330
And now I finally get to meet you.

995
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,910
- Are you perhaps...
- Ji Woo finally seems happy.

996
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,110
And I think it's all thanks to you.

997
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,410
Thank you.

998
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,850
Wait...

999
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,270
Hey, Ji Song.

1000
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:26,540
Da Hae! I just heard from Eun Sang.

1001
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,720
I will use the driver from now on
when I hit you.

1002
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,360
A fan of yours gave you this.

1003
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,930
What is this?

1004
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,940
You're the leading man now.

1005
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,140
Congratulations.
I'll always be rooting for you.

(Small Theater)

1007
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:29,600
Hey, guys.

1008
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,110
This morning, I couldn't get
the lid off the strawberry jam,

1009
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,510
and I almost popped my own lid.

1010
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,840
But then...

1011
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:44,050
Sweetheart, when did you
get so strong?

1012
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,320
From eating and playing a lot.

1013
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,320
Where could you play? It's so cold.

1014
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:52,060
It must be freezing where you are.

1015
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,790
What? What are you
talking about, Mom?

1016
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,560
Spring came a long time ago.

1017
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,560
The whole world is full of spring.

1018
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,030
What?

1019
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,880
You cried so much, Mom,
that all the ice melted away.

1020
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,680
Ji Sang...

1021
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,690
It's warm now, Mom.

1022
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,360
So you should go out
and have fun now, Mom.

1023
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,590
See? Go on out and play.

1024
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,030
That's when I realized.

1025
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,600
That maybe my grief
had started to fade.

1026
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:41,210
And that maybe, I could start over.

1027
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,450
So with that in mind, I'm thinking
we could have some fun again.

1028
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,280
What should we name
our new playground?

1029
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,820
- Ji Song.
- Eun Sang Town?

1030
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,350
- Da Hae.
- Ji Sang Villa?

1031
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,520
Or what about Average Street?

1032
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,830
Honestly, I haven't picked a name,

1033
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,630
so let's take our time
and build it together.

1034
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,400
So guys, come on over and play.

1035
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,680
Ji Song, did you bring
the rent money?

1036
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,350
Da Hae.

1037
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,750
- Eun Sang!
- Eun Sang!

1038
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,060
Eun Sang is back.

1039
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,590
I missed you.

1040
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,070
How was it?

1041
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,640
Did you have a good time?

1042
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,980
I cried my heart out.

1043
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,840
Are you feeling better now?

1044
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,910
I'm okay.

1045
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,880
I want to be okay.

1046
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,650
But...

1047
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,420
some grief is meant to be unpacked
a little at a time, over a lifetime.

1048
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,130
What about you two?

1049
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,870
Has life changed at all
after you made money?

1050
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,170
Well, as they say,
money makes money.

1051
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,670
Our shop is the most popular one
in the neighborhood.

1052
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,510
- Maybe I should raise the rent.
- No.

1053
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,980
I'm pretty much the same.

1054
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:33,920
I eat, work, sleep,
and rest now and then.

1055
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,190
I deal with people's drama.

1056
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,760
But after making money,

1057
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,360
I feel like I have the strength
to look forward to tomorrow.

1058
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,930
Yes.

1059
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,800
Lately, I get excited for
what each new day will bring.

1060
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,710
Are you sure it's just tomorrow
you're looking forward to?

1061
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,840
Is it just tomorrow?

1062
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,740
Come on.

1063
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,810
What are you talking about?
Seriously.

1064
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,980
- Are you sure it's just tomorrow...
- Let's ask again.

1065
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,120
you're looking forward to?

1066
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,350
Hey, didn't you two break up?

1067
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,820
- Should I just say it?
- You don't have to.

1068
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,960
Yes, sir.

1069
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,960
Yes, the seminar went well.

1070
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,270
No, I'm heading out from here.

1071
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,700
I have somewhere to stop by.

1072
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,240
Just because.

1073
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,770
Maybe because I need
a little mental reset?

1074
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,860
What?

1075
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,970
You...

1076
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,970
You really are a piece of work,
aren't you?

1077
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:36,010
- Dr. Ham.
- After a year, you'd just leave?

1078
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,810
Something came up that day.

1079
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,850
But I didn't just disappear.
I left you a card.

1080
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,450
Leaving a lingering note like that?

1081
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,290
I seriously thought we were over.

1082
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:51,990
I thought we were leads in a movie
with an open ending.

1083
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,330
No, what are you talking about?

1084
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,860
I just...

1085
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,570
Like you rooted for me, Dr. Ham,
I wanted to do the same for you.

1086
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:21,720
Why are you about to cry?
I missed you so much.

1087
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,990
Liar.

1088
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,160
It's true.

1089
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,100
I wanted to call you overseas
every single night.

1090
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:34,570
Do you have any idea how hard
I had to fight that urge?

1091
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,270
No, can't say I do.

1092
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,040
And plane tickets...

1093
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,610
Every day, I'd get to the buy button
and barely stop myself.

1094
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,850
- Do you get it now?
- And I'm telling you, I didn't.

1095
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,220
You have no idea
how much I missed you.

1096
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,680
It got so bad
I started seeing things.

1097
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,660
I thought I was going crazy
from studying too hard.

1098
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,860
What's with you?

1099
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,260
I'm over here pouring my heart out
about how much I missed you,

1100
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,100
and you give me nothing.

1101
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,840
Why aren't you saying anything?
You're making me nervous.

1102
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,510
Maybe it's because
you're talking too much?

1103
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,570
Excuse me?

1104
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,730
So, your ambition...

1105
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,370
Have you fulfilled it all?

1106
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,570
And your dream...

1107
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:47,770
Did you achieve it?

1108
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,380
No.

1109
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,850
There's one I haven't fulfilled yet.

1110
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,980
You, Dr. Ham.

1111
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,190
You...

1112
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,520
are the one dream I've been saving.

1113
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:05,260
So...

1114
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,090
let me keep on dreaming.

1115
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,130
Well, then...

1116
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,610
Why don't you put this on?

1117
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:51,970
I love you,

1118
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,570
Ham Ji Woo.

1119
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,690
A story like this one.

1120
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:52,560
So, how should the story
of those who desired more end?

1121
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,900
Being punished for their greed,

1122
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,340
would a bad ending like that
be natural?

1123
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,240
Life never goes the way you expect,

1124
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:06,050
and we're ready to enjoy
even its unpredictable moments.

1125
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:09,780
So I'd call this a happy ending
for everyone.

1126
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,650
And why not?

1127
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,550
Don't we have that opening event
next week?

1128
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,820
Aren't you taking it a bit too easy?

1129
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,260
Gosh, it's so bitter.

1130
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:18,320
And sour.

1131
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,330
That's weird.

1132
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:23,160
Why do I get a bad feeling
from its smell?

1133
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,570
Coffee's supposed to be bitter.

1134
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,500
Just drink what you're given.

1135
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,500
Mr. Ko Dae Young.

1136
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,240
Yes, boss.

1137
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,010
- Wait, I thought he was the boss.
- I don't know who's who anymore.

1138
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,510
What can I get for you?

1139
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,650
Make me another one.

1140
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,920
One that's tastier and more popular.

1141
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,920
Basically,

1142
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,490
- a better one!
- A better one!

1143
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:10,180
(To the Moon)

1144
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:52,140
(Thank you for watching
and supporting To the Moon.)

1145
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:57,250
(We will root for your journey
to your own moon as well.)

1146
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,560
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
