1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,270
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,510
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,880
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,210
We're seeing a rapid change
in seasons.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,350
The sweltering heat has continued
since the start of June.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,580
How was your commute this morning?

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,190
And temperatures will continue
to rise throughout the afternoon.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,820
We could even see record-breaking heat
for an early summer.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,100
This heat is expected to last,
so please take care of yourselves.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Da Hae.

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,370
Here are the files
for the Ppeppe Stick promotion.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,240
Mr. Ko needs the budget
for the new product done and sent.

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,710
Right.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,810
You seem to be in a good mood.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,680
Well, I can't complain.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,920
But something else is just as hot
as this heat wave.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,090
It's cryptocurrency.

18
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,990
Despite uncertain crypto returns,

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,290
many use
high-performance equipment...

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,130
and the number of private investors
getting into mining is on the rise.

21
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,500
News Breathe looks at the people,
hoping to strike it rich.

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,470
This whole mining thing is no joke.

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,400
There's the electric bill, upkeep,

24
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,470
and there's so much
you have to stay on top of.

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,740
But I'm positive
I'm going to hit the jackpot.

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,810
I mean, life's all about
that one big score, right?

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,150
What's going on?

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,990
Why am I getting goosebumps
all of a sudden?

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,600
(Episode 8: Mother and Daughter)

30
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,330
- Her birthday?
- Yes. It's my mom's 60th.

31
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,540
I've booked a surprise dinner party
at a full-course restaurant.

32
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,210
And next weekend
I'm taking her on a trip to Jeju.

33
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,310
Your mom is going to love that.

34
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,510
I'm happy, too.
I finally feel like a good daughter.

35
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,120
But isn't it kind of wild?

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,820
- What is?
- I mean, it's cryptocurrency,

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,590
but the money in my bank is real.

38
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,790
At this rate, I think I'll be able
to pay off my student loans.

39
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,990
Me too.
I can pay off all my credit cards,

40
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,400
- and maybe even get my own place.
- Yes.

41
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,770
It means I won't have to put up...

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,300
with being treated
like a freeloader.

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Good.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Move out. Please, just move out.

45
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,840
But, Eun Sang,
who do you keep texting, anyway?

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,380
Gosh, she's been like this lately.
Since we met our brother-in-law.

47
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,910
You have a death wish?

48
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,250
Who are you
calling your "brother-in-law?"

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,050
I meant ex. Ex-brother-in-law.

50
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,890
Gosh. Just my luck.

51
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,020
Of all the people to run into,
why did it have to be him?

52
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,530
Hey. You want me to say it again?

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,700
You're just
a money-grubbing monster.

54
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,930
Are you done?

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,470
What? Who is it?

56
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,840
It's Refund Complete.
The guy Eun Sang sent packing.

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,340
Her ex-husband.

58
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,310
- What?
- Give it back.

59
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,470
You'd stoop
to selling Ji Sang's stuff?

60
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,680
- Let go.
- Give it to me.

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,510
- Oh my gosh.
- I said, give it to me!

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,210
- Wait, stop!
- Hey, Mister!

63
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,050
- Mister!
- Darn it.

64
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,420
Who are you calling a monster?

65
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,590
Why would you say she's a monster?

66
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,620
That's right.
She's not just some regular monster.

67
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,930
- Girls, it's fine.
- She's a money-crazed zombie!

68
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,000
- A money-grubbing hound!
- An animal!

69
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,100
- A demon!
- Girls.

70
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,530
Make sure you're aiming
at the right target.

71
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,200
For your information,

72
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,040
she's not the lowlife you think.
Got it?

73
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
And that!

74
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,680
She got that as a gift!

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,080
No way. Who would give a gift
like that to her?

76
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,020
Is that true?

77
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,650
Either way, what's it to you?

78
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,620
If you two are over, let her go.
Stop being so pathetic. Seriously.

79
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,990
Come on, Eun Sang! Let's go!

80
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,800
- Let's go.
- But...

81
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,360
You listen to me.

82
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,370
If I ever see you again...

83
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,930
- Us, too.
- Us, too.

84
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,200
If we ever see you again,

85
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,970
you're dead. Got it?

86
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,370
- Got it?
- Got it?

87
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,810
Unbelievable...

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
What was that?

89
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,490
I should've beaten him half to death
when I saw him that day.

90
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,360
I went too easy on him,
and now he keeps pulling this crap.

91
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,030
What are you complaining about now?

92
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,890
"I know it's late to say this,"

93
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,260
"but I always hated how you smacked
your lips when you ate."

94
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,330
Hey!

95
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,700
"I know it's late to say this,
but your snoring is just as bad."

96
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,970
- Hey, now.
- Hold on.

97
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,000
This is hilarious.

98
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,140
"I know it's late to say this,"

99
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,670
"but you take dumps
till the seat is warm..."

100
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,970
"with the fan off..."

101
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,710
Gosh, are you really fighting
over this stuff?

102
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,310
Hey, I told you not to look.

103
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,750
Just ignore him. It's not worth it.

104
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,820
Ignoring him means he wins.
What a disrespectful jerk.

105
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,990
And to think,
he's two years younger than me.

106
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,490
- A younger husband.
- He's not my husband!

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,500
Da Hae, didn't you say your mom
was older than your dad too?

108
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,270
When's your dad's birthday?

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,540
Why'd you bring him up?
It's bad luck.

110
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,770
- Come on, he's still your dad.
- Father or not,

111
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,940
he's a stranger to me.

112
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,810
And my mom feels the same way.

113
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,680
I'll never see him again
as long as I live.

114
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
Gosh.

115
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,690
Who's 5-7-5-9?

116
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
Hello?

117
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,830
Excuse me?

118
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,630
The police station?

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why are you calling me?

120
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,770
Jung Yong Jik?

121
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
My dad?

122
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,210
That's your father, right?

123
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
We brought him in
after we found him passed out drunk.

124
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,550
What?

125
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,280
He's clinging to that thing tightly,

126
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,350
mumbling something about
a "jackpot."

127
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,920
He's just not making any sense.

128
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,860
Just sign here as his guardian,
and you can take him.

129
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,290
I don't know this person.

130
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Excuse me?

131
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,030
Da Hae?

132
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,570
Da Hae? Is that you?

133
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,940
But it seems he knows you.

134
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,140
Look, I already told you
I don't know him.

135
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,250
Born December 23, 1987.

136
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,850
Jung Da Hae
of the Changwon Jung clan.

137
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,220
Born at Park Daun OB-GYN at 12:05 a.m.

138
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,790
My daughter...

139
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,490
My daughter.

140
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,960
- What are you doing? Let go of me!
- Daughter.

141
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,900
- Let go!
- Ms. Jung Da Hae.

142
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,730
Please sign here
and take him with you.

143
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,500
Have you been well?

144
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,140
Gosh, my little girl
has grown so much.

145
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,140
Hey, aren't you even curious
how your dad's been?

146
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,450
Come on, at least look at me
when I'm talking to you.

147
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,750
Okay. There we go.

148
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,020
Let's get straight to the point.

149
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,920
Your dad found a business idea
that's my last shot...

150
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,430
at making it big time.

151
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,460
It's crypto.

152
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,030
It's a crypto mining operation.

153
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,670
You probably don't get it,
but this is the real deal.

154
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,270
Do you have any idea
how risky crypto mining is?

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,170
- What?
- What will you do...

156
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,910
if you set up shop
and then the government bans it?

157
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,410
What if you get hacked?

158
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,210
What's your contingency plan?
You don't have one, do you?

159
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
Well, about that...

160
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Hold on.

161
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,090
How do you know so much about this?

162
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,950
Don't tell me
you're into crypto too?

163
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,960
Is that a problem?

164
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,390
Well, look at that. It must be true.

165
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,330
What business is it of yours
if I'm into crypto or not?

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,030
Hey, a rookie like you
can't just dive in.

167
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,400
You must do it under the supervision
of an expert, like me.

168
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,440
So, how much profit have you made?

169
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,570
What was your initial seed money?

170
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,110
Still as shameless as ever, I see.

171
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,350
If you're trying to play the part
of a concerned father,

172
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,380
isn't it a little too late for that?

173
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,450
Da Hae.

174
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,650
Let's not drag this out.
We should just go our separate ways.

175
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,950
I wish you the best of luck
with your business.

176
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,520
And I hope we never meet again.
Goodbye.

177
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,690
Come on, Da Hae.

178
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,660
Hey, wait! Da Hae!

179
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,940
- Mom.
- Yes?

180
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,840
- Mom.
- What is it?

181
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,510
Is there anyone...

182
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,320
you've been wanting to see?

183
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,850
What?

184
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,090
Someone you miss
who you haven't seen in a while,

185
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,790
or you're wondering
how they're doing.

186
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm asking
if there's anyone you miss.

187
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,600
What are you talking about?

188
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,430
What I mean is...

189
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,310
What about Auntie Young Nam?

190
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,110
Don't you miss her?
We haven't seen her in ages.

191
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,910
Of course, I miss Young Nam.

192
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,110
She's not the only one.
I miss Tae Seop too,

193
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,280
and there's Ok Hee
and her granddaughter...

194
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,420
What was her name again?

195
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,460
She had dark eyes
and bright red lips.

196
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,490
Gosh, Mom. Everyone's eyes are dark
and their lips are red.

197
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,690
- So Young?
- Right, So Young.

198
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,230
I miss that kid, So Young,
the most of all.

199
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,670
Mom, what about food?

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,470
That thing you love.
What was it called again?

201
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,570
What thing?

202
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,110
Come on. You know the one.

203
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,640
It's kind of stinky,
it looks kind of gross,

204
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,650
and it hides, so it's hard to catch.

205
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
You mean your father?

206
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,990
Baby octopus.

207
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,130
Mom, you love raw baby octopus.

208
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,730
I thought it was something else.

209
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,830
Your father showed up?

210
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,000
The one you said
had "Jackpot Fever?"

211
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,770
- Wait, so he's still not over it?
- He's into crypto mining now, so...

212
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,510
You're not going to tell your mom?

213
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,540
Of course not.

214
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,610
- But still...
- No, no buts.

215
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,080
Him being here is a secret, okay?

216
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,350
I'm finally spending money on her,
and I don't want to spoil the mood.

217
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,560
Anyway, forget that.
Now for something truly important.

218
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,830
What song should we go with?

219
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,770
<i>On a street of burning neon</i>

220
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,040
<i>Beneath a lonely streetlamp's light</i>

221
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,710
<i>You and I, we met once upon a time</i>

222
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
(Mother, thank you. I love you.)

223
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,110
<i>I wonder what you're doing now</i>

224
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,080
<i>When I get lost in thought</i>

225
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,390
<i>I find myself endlessly missing you,</i>
<i>Jung Im</i>

226
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,990
<i>Your fiery eyes</i>

227
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,730
<i>Those thirsty lips</i>

228
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,170
<i>Even the stars have gone to sleep</i>

229
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,070
<i>And just like this, forever</i>

230
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,340
<i>I will love you, Jung Im</i>

231
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,850
<i>That one blissful word</i>

232
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,080
<i>It's not too late</i>

233
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,050
<i>If you'll return to my side</i>

234
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,860
<i>I will love you for all time</i>

235
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,090
Hey, get Mom's cake.

236
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Got it.

237
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,170
All right, Mother, happy birthday!

238
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,470
You're a lucky woman, Jung Im.

239
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,270
The trouble your husband gave you
is a thing of the past.

240
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,710
Da Hae is such a good daughter.

241
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,480
You're so lucky
in your golden years.

242
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,240
Oh, please.

243
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,950
But still,

244
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,980
on days like today,
I feel like I get a reminder.

245
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,280
A reminder that my daughter
is doing just fine.

246
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,350
That the world
hasn't been too cruel.

247
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,760
It makes me so happy.

248
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,490
The way I'm feeling now,

249
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,530
I'd even forgive him
if he came back.

250
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,930
- Look at you, a regular saint.
- Honey.

251
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,000
What was that?
Did he really show up?

252
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,740
Didn't you guys hear that?

253
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,140
- Gosh, that scared me!
- Hey, what's going on?

254
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,210
Oh, my.

255
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Honey?

256
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,480
What's going on?

257
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,250
Am I the only one hearing things?

258
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,980
Honey, Jung Im. It's me.

259
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Oh, my gosh!

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What in the world?

261
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,270
(For a Mom as beautiful as a flower,
Your Best Years Start Now!)

262
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,370
Jung Im.

263
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,900
I'm...

264
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,740
back.

265
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,910
You!

266
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,210
What are you doing here?

267
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,550
Darn it.

268
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,860
You're scary.
Hey, don't come closer.

269
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,290
Just talk from over there!

270
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,810
Goodness!

271
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,540
What in the world is going on?

272
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,040
What's this nonsense
on her birthday?

273
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,370
This is a disaster.

274
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,080
You've got to be kidding me.

275
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,280
What a waste.

276
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,890
So? What is it?

277
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,960
What is this business you're in?

278
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,960
I told you, it's in mining.

279
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Where exactly are you mining?

280
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,930
In the sea, so to speak.

281
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,470
- The sea of information?
- What are you mining from the sea?

282
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,110
It's something that can contribute
to the advancement of humanity...

283
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,810
Are you digging for abalone
or oysters?

284
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,480
It's crypto.

285
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,480
Hey, what was that for?
Do you even know what crypto is?

286
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,160
That's not a real job, is it?
You don't do honest work, do you?

287
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,860
Not exactly.

288
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
But if you're aiming
for one big score...

289
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,700
Come on, Mom. Let's go.
Why waste your breath on him?

290
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,900
Aren't you ashamed
to even face Da Hae?

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,240
Our daughter,

292
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,370
whom you just abandoned
without a second thought.

293
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,870
After seeing how well
she's turned out,

294
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,680
how do you even have the nerve
to show your face here?

295
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,280
Hey, come on, don't be like that.

296
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,210
If it's so pathetic
and has no future,

297
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,580
then why is she doing it too?

298
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,020
Mom, let's just go.

299
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,820
What are you talking about?

300
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,920
Da Hae is the smart one here.

301
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,930
She figured out you can't get rich
just by working hard anymore.

302
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,830
Hey, you, how much did you invest?

303
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,170
Well... Mom...

304
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Mom...

305
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,040
- It's just...
- Stop.

306
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,540
Wait a minute. Stop. Just stop.

307
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,690
Mom.

308
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,990
Mom, where are you going?

309
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,760
- Hey, Da Hae.
- What?

310
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,870
- You should go after her.
- Don't worry about us. Just go.

311
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,140
Okay. Sorry about this.

312
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,440
Go on.

313
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,510
Mom.

314
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,550
How about some crab on our trip?
You love crab.

315
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,080
I don't want any crab
bought with money from crypto.

316
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,190
Come on, Mom.

317
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,890
But still,
that crypto money I earned...

318
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,220
lets me send you on this trip,

319
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,930
and we could finally stop renting.

320
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,900
When you think about it,
it's not like it was for nothing.

321
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,640
You're just like him.

322
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,340
What?

323
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,910
I was poor with nothing to give,

324
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,210
so I worked hard,
hoping you'd learn from my example.

325
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,320
I gritted my teeth and endured
so you would never be ashamed of me.

326
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,120
So why would you be like the father
who was never there for you?

327
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,290
- Why? Why?
- Mom...

328
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,530
Mom, it's not like that!

329
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,130
I'm not like Dad,
hoping to hit the jackpot.

330
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,370
I just...

331
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,510
I want things to be a bit better
than they are now.

332
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,610
Just a little...

333
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,750
I want to be more comfortable.
That's all.

334
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,650
I can't stand the sight of you.
Get out.

335
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,100
It's like a funeral in here.

336
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,600
All I hear is constant wailing.

337
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,640
If it weren't for my dad,
everything was going so well.

338
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,870
How could he show up right then
and drop a bombshell like that?

339
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,910
Seriously, he's no help at all.
None.

340
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,660
You must've been worried for Da Hae.

341
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,630
- Right?
- Yes.

342
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,860
Are you still texting him?

343
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Without even washing your hands?

344
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,870
If I'm even a little late to reply,
he thinks he's won.

345
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,800
That psycho.

346
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,640
This lunatic.

347
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,210
(To be honest,
your cooking was torture.)

348
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,580
Anyone would think you're flirting.

349
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,280
Not puppy love, this is a dogfight.

350
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,450
We were like when we lived together.

351
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,580
If we made eye contact, it was on.

352
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,820
We'd fight in our sleep
and in the middle of a meal.

353
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,760
Why do you guys fight so much?

354
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,490
Couples fight over money.
What else is there to fight about?

355
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,360
Then what are you
fighting about now?

356
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,100
You're not married anymore,
and you're both earning money.

357
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,630
Good question. Maybe because...

358
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,570
we don't have kids?

359
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,370
Should I be crying now?
Is this where I'm supposed to cry?

360
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
Get lost.
This is the part where you get lost.

361
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,980
- Hey, that's cold! Stop it!
- Get lost!

362
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,020
This guy.

363
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,460
Ji Song.

364
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,730
Here's the corporate card statement.

365
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,330
Thanks.

366
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,930
You look like you're in a good mood.

367
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,000
Everyone else is
so busy and stressed.

368
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,610
My boyfriend is coming
to Korea in a few days.

369
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,340
His parents are coming on business,
and he's tagging along.

370
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,840
We haven't seen each other
in so long,

371
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,580
so I'm just really excited.

372
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,650
Ji Song, you're in
a long-distance one, right?

373
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,380
- Yes.
- But if his parents are coming,

374
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,920
doesn't that mean
it's about marriage?

375
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,420
What's this? Don't tell me
it's to meet the parents!

376
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,790
- No, of course not.
- What?

377
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,490
But then again,

378
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,600
I have that "parent-approved" look.

379
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,670
"It's a pleasure to meet you."

380
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,370
"Thank you for
making the long trip."

381
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,400
"I made a reservation. Shall we go?"
"Father. Mother."

382
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,870
Excuse me?

383
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,140
Can you say all that in Chinese?

384
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,850
If you're going to get married,
shouldn't you be able to say that?

385
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,550
Meeting parents
you can't communicate with is...

386
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,020
Ji Song,

387
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,090
you often say things
without thinking them through.

388
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,490
It's cute, though.

389
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,890
Assistant Manager Oh,
do you have that file I asked for?

390
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,800
What?

391
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,830
Gosh.

392
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,230
- Goodness.
- Why is this all crumpled?

393
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,440
Oh, sorry...

394
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,470
Here you go.

395
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,880
It wasn't my breath,
it was your feet.

396
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,340
Wait, what? What's this?

397
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,640
"I know it's late to say this,"

398
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,180
"but you singing in the shower
was like a pig being slaughtered."

399
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,250
Hey, was I the only one?

400
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,620
Was I the only one? You did it too!

401
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,890
You were Uhm Jung Hwa, Baek Z Young.

402
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,060
Who held a national singing contest?
What is it now?

403
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,500
''Oh, right.
I know it's late to say this,"

404
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,660
"but every night..."

405
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,800
Why bring our sex life into this?
You!

406
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,970
You're really going there?
You want to crush my ego today?

407
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,010
You're so dead.

408
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,310
You want to talk bedroom?

409
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,310
Mom.

410
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,680
Hold on a second.

411
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,420
Gosh, someone keeps sending me
weird texts.

412
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,790
Here you go.

413
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,960
Make sure you chew it well.

414
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,830
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's delicious.

415
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,900
- But...
- Yes?

416
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,970
Why aren't Ji Sang and her mom here?

417
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,970
I miss them.

418
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,010
What?

419
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,090
Three.

420
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,060
- Eun Sang, you're getting a text.
- Four.

421
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,660
Just ignore it.

422
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,000
Five.

423
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,260
But they keep coming.

424
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,670
Who is it?
It can't be that jerk, can it?

425
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,070
- Give it to me.
- Just wrap it up and come out.

426
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,810
Gosh, what does it say?

427
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,810
If I don't reply,
he'll start cussing.

428
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,410
- Just reply for me.
- Gosh.

429
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,640
Ten.

430
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,020
"Kang Eun Sang."

431
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,120
- What?
- That's all it says.

432
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,720
With an ellipsis at the end.
"Kang Eun Sang..."

433
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,890
What the heck?

434
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,860
Why the sudden olive branch?

435
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,060
I got another one.

436
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,900
"Lucky you for having thick poop."

437
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,900
He's totally trying
to pick a fight with you.

438
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,470
My gosh, what's with him?

439
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,440
No, why is he suddenly
eating humble pie?

440
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,840
How is that an apology?

441
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,170
It says,
"Lucky you for having thick poop."

442
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,380
"A life with fine meals,
healthy dumps."

443
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,880
What greater blessing is there?

444
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,610
I know him.

445
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,580
He's not the type to say
something nice for no reason.

446
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,750
I don't get it at all.

447
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,120
I'll never understand
married couples.

448
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,520
We're not married!

449
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,160
Gosh, where do I even start?

450
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,770
What is it?

451
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,630
Cut the cheesy act.
What do you want?

452
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
What is it?

453
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,840
What? Go where with you?

454
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,540
Are you out of your mind right now?

455
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,610
I have a favor to ask.

456
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,650
My mom is really fond of you,
you know.

457
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,150
Can't you just do this for me?

458
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,010
- Get up.
- Okay.

459
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,010
Jung Im.

460
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,950
What's wrong?

461
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,190
Holding scissors that way
is dangerous.

462
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,290
Put them down.

463
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,190
Come here. Sit.

464
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,240
What's gotten into you?

465
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,180
I think we need to cut them off.

466
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,120
- My neck?
- Those wretched hands.

467
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,920
They just need to be cut off.
Come here.

468
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,990
Hey, wait.

469
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,720
Honey, I'm not just
doing this for myself.

470
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,830
If this hits the jackpot,

471
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,030
I can make it all up
for all the suffering you've endured...

472
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,360
in one shot.

473
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,830
Can't you tell by
what Da Hae is doing?

474
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,330
That's the problem!

475
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,900
She's your flesh and blood,
of course.

476
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,340
Now Da Hae's in
on this nonsense too!

477
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,440
Come on, be honest.

478
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,870
You always say
Da Hae takes after me,

479
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,080
but from where I'm standing,
she's a spitting image of you.

480
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,280
Cold-blooded and ruthless.
She has a terrifying temper.

481
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,550
After I left,
for three years straight,

482
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,950
she left me voicemails
before I could even change my number.

483
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,090
And I'm her father.

484
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,560
Rain or shine,
she never missed a single day.

485
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,330
She was so diligent
about cussing me out.

486
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,130
If killing people
with words was a crime,

487
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,730
she'd get the death penalty,
at least.

488
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,430
You need to realize that.

489
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,500
- I'll have to teach her a lesson.
- Right?

490
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,270
I should've taught her to use
some really vulgar words on you.

491
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,780
What was that about your daughter?
"The death penalty?"

492
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,280
How dare you say that?
About your own daughter?

493
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,220
Hold on. Hey, Jung Im.
Wait, Jung Im.

494
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,090
Look, let's talk about this later.

495
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,600
(Medication)

496
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,270
What's all this? Another gift?

497
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,970
My father brought them
from his trip.

498
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,640
He wanted everyone to try some.

499
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,180
Gosh, we can't keep accepting these.

500
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,680
Please thank him for us.

501
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,850
Okay, I will.

502
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,020
Seriously, thanks to you, Da Hee,
I get to try desserts from all over.

503
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,820
It's really nothing.

504
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,450
Does your father bring back
gifts like this every time?

505
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,520
Yes. He's very thoughtful.

506
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,060
Abroad, he visits dessert shops...

507
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,160
and buys lots of things he thinks
my mom and I would like.

508
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,000
Gosh, your father's so sweet.

509
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,370
Here, Ms. Round, you have one too.

510
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,970
No, thank you. I'll have one later.

511
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,140
What's with the fuss
when I'm handing you one?

512
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,850
They're from Da Hee's father.
From Belgium.

513
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,020
We shouldn't just eat
these ourselves.

514
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,850
What about Dr. Ham...

515
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,160
- Right. I'll take them.
- I already did.

516
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,390
I gave them
to his secretary already.

517
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,490
She's something else, isn't she?

518
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,460
- Always one step ahead.
- Da Hee, can I have one?

519
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Right! Da Hae!

520
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,770
Someone from your family is
in the lobby to see you.

521
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,340
- What? My family?
- Yes.

522
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,870
My mom?

523
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,580
No, he said he was your father.
You should hurry down.

524
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,850
Yes, I get it.
But my daughter works here.

525
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,250
Yes, sir, I understand.
Please just wait a moment.

526
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,150
You get it? Then why make me wait?
I'll just go in and find her.

527
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,090
Please speak with your daughter
when she comes down.

528
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,990
You get it, so what's the problem?
I can just go in.

529
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,860
- What do you think you're doing?
- Da Hae.

530
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,560
This guy just won't listen
to reason.

531
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,770
- Come outside!
- What?

532
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,340
I couldn't tell you this earlier
since you were in a meeting.

533
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,470
Yes? What is it?

534
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,710
The marketing team sent
some chocolates.

535
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,280
I left them on your desk.

536
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,840
Marketing...

537
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,210
By any chance,
were they from Jung Da Hae?

538
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,580
- You mean Da Hee.
- No, Da Hae.

539
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,420
- Hee...
- Hae...

540
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,790
- Hee...
- Hae...

541
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,290
You just hear what you want to hear,
don't you?

542
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,060
So, are you saying
I should go thank her?

543
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,160
I already thanked her for you.

544
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,930
I should thank her myself.
It's common courtesy.

545
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,410
Drop me off here and go on ahead.
I'll say thanks and then come up.

546
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,910
Maybe I should just quit.

547
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
What is this?

548
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,490
What are you doing here?

549
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,190
What was I supposed to do?
You weren't picking up your phone.

550
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,430
If I'm not picking up,
doesn't that mean I'm avoiding you?

551
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,330
- Why are you making a scene here?
- Come on, don't be like that.

552
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,200
Do you have any money?

553
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,470
What?

554
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,800
You're into crypto too,
so you must get it, right?

555
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,210
You know how great an opportunity
this mining business is.

556
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,580
Once you have the seed money,
it'll blow up before you know it.

557
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,340
Don't struggle on your own.

558
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,350
Trust your dad with it,
and I'll double it for you.

559
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,420
I'm offering this to you,
my daughter.

560
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,690
Are you seriously...

561
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,090
asking me for money right now?

562
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,820
I'm not asking for a handout.

563
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,760
This is an investment opportunity.

564
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,130
Fine.

565
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,330
Look...

566
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,410
I never expected my father
to ever buy me chocolates.

567
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
But...

568
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,910
even so...

569
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,650
That doesn't mean...

570
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,220
you have to be the dad who makes
my life bitter every single time.

571
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,920
What are you talking about?

572
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,030
Do you know why
I even started with crypto?

573
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,800
That's because...

574
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,600
- you wanted to make money.
- Right.

575
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,300
That's part of it,

576
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,600
but the real reason is
I did it to survive.

577
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,180
Others start life with good parents,
but not me.

578
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,950
Because my life just keeps
pushing me closer to the edge.

579
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,280
I got into crypto
just to stay alive.

580
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,220
But when you get right down to it,

581
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,620
the reason my life's like this
is all your fault.

582
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,420
If you hadn't spent your whole life
making a mess of things...

583
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,090
and dragged my life down
into the gutter with you,

584
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,730
do you think I would've ever gotten
involved in something like crypto?

585
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,900
Do you think Mom and I
would be living this pathetic life?

586
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
So,

587
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,110
if you have any conscience at all,

588
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,940
please, just go.

589
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,350
Just get out of our lives
and stay out!

590
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,610
Sir, are you okay? Sir?

591
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,210
Hey, stay with me.

592
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,880
Da Hae!

593
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,150
Jung Da Hae, what are you doing!

594
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,820
Da Hae!

595
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,220
(Emergency Center)

596
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,790
Cancer?

597
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,560
Yes. Six months ago,

598
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,900
he was diagnosed with stage two
non-small cell lung cancer.

599
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,330
Wait a second. So you're saying...

600
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,840
it's cancer?

601
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,210
We need to schedule his surgery
right away.

602
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,340
After the surgery,

603
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,750
he'll need separate chemotherapy
and radiation treatments,

604
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,550
and we need to move on this
as soon as possible.

605
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,630
Are you okay? You must be in shock.

606
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,430
What did the doctor say?

607
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,830
It's always one thing after another.

608
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,170
What?

609
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,500
It's just one hardship
after another.

610
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,740
And to think I was so clueless,

611
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,710
I was just putting on a brave face.

612
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,320
Remember what I said before?

613
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,990
All that talk about
overcoming any hardship...

614
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,450
and enduring anything.

615
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
How pathetic.

616
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,240
Whatever you have to overcome,

617
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,440
and whatever you have to endure...

618
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,480
We promised we'd do it together.

619
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,790
But is that really necessary?

620
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,590
What are you trying to say?

621
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,730
I think I've opened a door,
but I find another one slammed shut.

622
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,240
I knock on what I think is a door,
but it turns out to be a wall.

623
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,710
My life is just one dead end
after another.

624
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,650
With a life like this,

625
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,820
I just don't know if I should
drag someone else into it.

626
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:14,350
Mother... You are...

627
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,990
very beautiful.

628
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,820
What kind of food do you like?

629
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,290
Watch out! Be careful.

630
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,560
Thank you.

631
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,900
Gosh, what were you staring at
while you were walking?

632
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,400
I was practicing my Chinese.

633
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,210
About...

634
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,470
this whole marriage thing...

635
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,110
You're really serious,

636
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,080
aren't you?

637
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,420
Do you really need
an answer to that?

638
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,120
You're not a glutton
for punishment, are you?

639
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,090
No, that's not it.

640
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,590
I'm just curious, that's all.

641
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,890
Do you actually want to get married,
or is it...

642
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,590
Well...

643
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,600
It's not so much that I want
to get married.

644
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Right?

645
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,230
So you aren't
actually set on marriage...

646
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,940
or anything like that, are you?

647
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,670
Right. I just want to have a plan
for my life for once.

648
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,610
You what?

649
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,040
Up until now,
my motto was, "Live for today."

650
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,140
"There's no tomorrow."

651
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,810
That's basically how I lived,
you know?

652
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,110
But then crypto...

653
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,650
No. Anyway, for a while now,

654
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,020
I've been thinking that I want
to live for a better tomorrow.

655
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,520
That I should save my money...

656
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,260
so I'll have it
when I really need it.

657
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,930
I've been thinking about that.

658
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,460
So I guess marriage is something...

659
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,230
that I should start considering seriously.
Isn't it about time?

660
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,870
So I'm trying to be
more responsible.

661
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,310
And in that plan, does...

662
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,710
your current boyfriend have to be...

663
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,520
part of it?

664
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,550
Marry a handsome man, get rich,
and live happily ever after.

665
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,990
That's my plan.

666
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,360
A handsome...

667
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,360
Come on, you can't live
on good looks alone.

668
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,430
Who says I can't?

669
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,240
But...

670
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,550
First things first,
we have to save him.

671
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,800
I'll cash out my savings.

672
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,240
- If you just pitch in a little.
- What?

673
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,650
Mom.

674
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,550
Are you being serious right now?

675
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,390
I know I have no right
to ask you this.

676
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,430
But we can't just leave him
like this.

677
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,270
And why can't we?

678
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,300
Do you think I...

679
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,340
earned all this money
just to give it to that man?

680
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,310
No.

681
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,610
I won't give him a single cent.

682
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
Da Hae...

683
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,290
Mom...

684
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,090
Gosh, let's just go.

685
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,160
- If we just ignore him and leave...
- After your dad left,

686
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,960
you called him every day
for three years, right?

687
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,300
Dad, where are you?
They put repo notices on our house.

688
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,740
Get over here and fix this now.

689
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm going to curse you
for the rest of my life.

690
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,480
The baseball team you root for
will never win the championship,

691
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,080
and your favorite brand of soju
will be discontinued.

692
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,320
Don't even try to start a business!
You're guaranteed to fail!

693
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,550
Don't dream of crawling back here
with nothing to your name, you hear?

694
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,890
Dad...

695
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,430
Dad...

696
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,510
Dad...

697
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,180
I was cursing him out.

698
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,820
You might say you did it
out of spite,

699
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,330
but can someone do that
for three years,

700
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,790
fueled by hatred alone?

701
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,260
Don't try to sugarcoat it.

702
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,400
It was because I hated him.
That's all.

703
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,580
You're the kind of person who,

704
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,250
every time you moved up
to a new grade,

705
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,780
you hated being in a different class
from your friends so much...

706
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,550
that you'd cry for three days
and refuse to eat.

707
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,360
The snowman you made one winter,

708
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,730
you kept in the freezer
until the following spring.

709
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,770
Whenever you got a good snack
at school lunch,

710
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,540
- you'd save it for your dad and me.
- What's your point?

711
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,250
A kid as sentimental
and full of heart as you...

712
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,680
How could you ever sever
your family ties?

713
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,390
How could you ever cut your father
out of your life?

714
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,930
Forget it.

715
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,230
Just stop talking.

716
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,800
Mom, if you're not leaving,

717
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,410
then I am.

718
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,980
- Da Hae.
- Let go!

719
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,920
Da Hae.

720
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,830
Mom.

721
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,500
What do you think you're doing?

722
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,440
- Mom, what's wrong with you?
- Da Hae, I'm so sorry.

723
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,220
I'm sorry we couldn't do
more for you.

724
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,190
Get up. What are you doing?

725
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,360
Get up.

726
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,760
In this harsh world,

727
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,260
I'm sorry you're stuck
with parents like us.

728
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,040
If you let your dad die like this,

729
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,480
it'll weigh on you
for the rest of your life.

730
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,380
Da Hae.

731
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,680
Don't get hurt anymore...

732
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,480
and don't suffer.

733
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,190
Just this one last time,

734
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,390
won't you find it in your heart
to forgive your father?

735
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,800
It'll scar you for life,

736
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,100
so how could I ask you
to just ignore that?

737
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,850
Why did she have to kneel?

738
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,750
What was she thinking?
Saying her parents gave me nothing.

739
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,560
What does that even mean?

740
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,690
Especially when she gave me
her kidney...

741
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,200
- Gave you what?
- A kidney?

742
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,600
When? Wait, why?

743
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,370
It was right after
my college entrance exams.

744
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,740
I actually did really well
on the test.

745
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,210
I had a first-choice school,
but the private tuition was steep.

746
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,980
Still, I thought
we'd figure it out somehow.

747
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,780
Mom.

748
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,520
The tuition money.

749
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,320
These perilla leaves
are a bit salty, aren't they?

750
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,260
I was in such a rush this morning...

751
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,230
that I must have added
way too much salt.

752
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,330
They're not salty.

753
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,970
- But...
- Weren't you craving pork belly?

754
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,670
I should stop by
the butcher's later.

755
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,710
Do you think I was born just to eat?

756
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,380
Food is what gives us strength.

757
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,310
You can't do much
on an empty stomach.

758
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,450
You can't do anything
without money either.

759
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,960
But still,

760
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,790
we have enough for
the first semester's tuition, right?

761
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,760
I can figure out the rest
once I'm enrolled.

762
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,400
We have at least that much,
don't we?

763
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,740
Well, the thing is...

764
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,110
Do you really have to go this year?

765
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,380
You don't want me to go?

766
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,850
No, I'm just asking.

767
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,720
That's a loaded question.

768
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,590
You're saying
you don't want me to go.

769
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,430
It's just that...

770
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,640
You know how hard things have been
this year.

771
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,040
Your dad...

772
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,010
It's always about Dad.
Why must I give up so much for him?

773
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,880
Mom, why would you have a child
with a man like that?

774
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,250
How could you say something
like that?

775
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,150
You...

Yes.

785
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,300
- For my college tuition...
- Got any collateral?

786
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,040
- My diligence?
- What?

787
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,640
Never mind.

788
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:51,980
I'm sorry.

789
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,780
I think I've come
to the wrong place.

790
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,120
Hey.

791
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,960
Are you really that diligent?

792
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,430
Yes, I really am.

793
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,460
Without my work ethic, I'm nothing.

794
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,630
A dead person can't work part-time.

795
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,930
- What?
- Want a part-time job?

Hey, it's easy stuff.

just answer the phone.

799
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,010
Easy, right?

800
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,580
So, are you interested?

801
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,190
Look at this punk. Not picking up?

802
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,290
We're stepping out for a bit.

803
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,560
If you borrow money,
you have to pay it back.

804
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,430
Why do we always have to
go find them? Darn it.

805
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,400
But what if someone calls?

806
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,730
You memorized the script,
didn't you?

00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,700
It's 30 days interest-free,

two percent or less. Right?

809
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,200
But it's all so sudden.

810
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,640
Da Hae.

811
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,480
- You can do this.
- We're counting on you.

812
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,710
Let's go!

813
00:46:58,410 --> 00:46:59,510
Wait!

814
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,980
What do I do?

We offer 30 days interest-free.

Yes, this is Seonkwang Loans.

00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,740
Hello...

820
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,140
- Hello?
- I was wondering...

821
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,110
if I could borrow some money?

822
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,120
- Hello?
- Hello...

823
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,720
Yes.

824
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,290
Here at Seonkwang Loans,

825
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,090
we offer
a 30-day interest-free period.

826
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,330
Oh, well...

827
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,600
I'm a little short
on my daughter's tuition money.

828
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,670
My daughter did really well on her
college entrance exams,

829
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,930
but with our financial situation,
there's just no way...

830
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,910
It feels awkward to say this,

831
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,210
but I've driven the town bus
for five years...

832
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,640
with a perfect safety record.

833
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,680
And I've always held a job,
even before that.

834
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:09,850
By any chance,

835
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,020
do you live around here?

836
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,920
I'm the driver of Bus 17.

837
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,090
I've even received commendations
for my friendly service.

838
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,030
If you'll just lend me the money,
I swear I'll pay it back.

839
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,570
I absolutely will,

840
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,210
but I hear these things also have...

841
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,140
a screening process
or something like that.

842
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,780
I'm only saying this just in case,

843
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,120
my liver and my kidneys...

844
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,320
are both perfectly healthy.

845
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,660
I'll be home a little late
starting tomorrow.

846
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,700
About...

847
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,230
the tuition...

848
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,300
If you just give me more time,
I'll...

849
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,340
I was off by a row.

850
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,710
- You what?
- On the math section.

851
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,250
I was off by one row
on the answer sheet.

852
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,480
So it looks like my first choice
is out of the question.

853
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,120
So I'm going for my second choice.

854
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,120
Plus, I can get a scholarship
if I go there.

855
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,260
Are you sure? Did you double-check?

856
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:32,930
Yes.

857
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,380
I'm so sorry.

858
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,150
I'm the one who messed up the test.
Why are you apologizing, Mom?

859
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,690
I overcooked the meat.

860
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,460
You did.

861
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,160
It is a little tough.

862
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,840
I...

863
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,310
received something more precious
than a kidney.

864
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,510
My mom always gave me
more than enough.

865
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,080
But why does she always act
so guilty in front of me?

866
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,920
That's how all moms are.

867
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,450
You see, for moms,

868
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,590
just looking at her child's face
makes her feel guilty, you know?

869
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,790
She thinks, "If my child learns
to hate someone for the first time,"

870
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,500
"it'll probably be me."

871
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,040
"When they're overwhelmed
by despair in life,"

872
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,840
"that'll be my fault, too."

873
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,310
"And then someday,"

874
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,910
"when the world has hurt them
and they need someone to lean on,"

875
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,920
"I might not be there for them."

876
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:01,760
"What will I do
when I can't be there?"

877
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:07,290
For the sins they committed
and the ones they haven't,

878
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,960
they're just sorry for everything.

879
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,230
For their whole lives,

880
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,400
I guess, mothers are destined
to live with that guilt.

881
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,970
That's so...

882
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,540
that's just too sad.

883
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,910
And it's such a lonely burden
for a mother to carry.

884
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,450
Seeing you cry is making me...

885
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,330
You two are hopeless.

886
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,400
This is why...

887
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,670
parents are always destined
to feel guilty.

888
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,410
Please, just help me out
this one time.

889
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,020
I've missed you so much.
What took you so long?

890
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,920
I was just so busy trying to get by.

891
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,890
I'm sorry, Mother.

892
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,660
I know. You can't help it
if you're busy.

893
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,570
Are you still taking good care
of Ji Sang's mother?

894
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,340
- Mom...
- You'd bring her meals and fruit...

895
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,240
and feed her yourself, didn't you?

896
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,750
I still do.

897
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,980
Right?

898
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,820
What?

899
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,720
Goodness.

900
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,520
Here.

901
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,820
Honey. Open up.

902
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,130
- See?
- That's lovely to see.

903
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,870
But...

904
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,770
why are you two sitting
so far apart?

905
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,840
You used to be attached at the hip.

906
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,150
Goodness, Mom.

907
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,010
I know, right?

908
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,320
Honey, come closer.
Scoot over. What's wrong?

909
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,520
- Goodness.
- No, I was just worried...

910
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,720
you'd be uncomfortable.

911
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,020
Happy now?

912
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,590
Good.

913
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,500
Oh, my. Where's Ji Sang?

914
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:27,130
You should've told her
that her grandma misses her.

915
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,110
Mom, about that...

916
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,840
Mother, Ji Sang went to camp
with her preschool.

917
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,850
She was so excited to go,

918
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,310
saying she'd eat well
and see the circus.

919
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,850
Would you like to see a picture
of her?

920
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,790
She's so precious. Oh my.

921
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,270
She was always such a picky eater,
so I was constantly worried.

922
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,470
Is she eating well now?

923
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,500
Of course.

924
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,610
She even eats her carrots
and her spinach.

925
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,380
What a good girl.

926
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,550
But I feel like I've seen
this picture before.

927
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:20,320
Why is our Ji Sang always playing
somewhere so cold?

928
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,460
She's in a place
that's waiting for spring.

929
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,600
And where Ji Sang is,

930
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,060
spring will come soon.

931
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,630
I'm sure it will.

932
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,140
Yes, that's nice.

933
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:49,720
Use this to buy Ji Sang
something nice to eat.

934
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,450
Don't give it to her dad.
It's just for you and Ji Sang, okay?

935
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,430
Okay.

936
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,150
My mom has changed a lot,
hasn't she?

937
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,080
I like it.

938
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,520
The way your mother insists on...

939
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:28,620
calling me "Ji Sang's mom,"

940
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,590
and how she remembers Ji Sang
as vividly as we do.

941
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,360
Pretending that we sent
our daughter to camp...

942
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,460
didn't feel too bad either.

943
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,440
So what made you change your mind?

944
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,680
I really thought you weren't coming.

945
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,580
I know it's late to say this, but..

946
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,320
Are you starting something again?

947
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,250
Do you know how flabbergasted I was
after reading this?

948
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,420
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

949
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,690
"I know it's late to say this, but.."

950
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,060
I realized I wasn't alone.

951
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,830
What?

952
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,960
A mother's fate is to live
with guilt toward her child.

953
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,030
But since you were by my side,

954
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:18,540
I don't think I was ever just lonely
and scared all by myself.

955
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,740
Parents are partners in crime,
sharing guilt over their child.

956
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,650
So, I know it's late to say this,

957
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,690
but I was grateful.

958
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,090
For being my partner in crime.

959
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:46,930
Me too.

960
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,600
I was grateful too.

00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,580
Gosh.

971
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:43,480
I didn't know you were here.

972
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,020
I thought you'd gone off
to sell a kidney or something!

973
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,140
You know...

974
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,480
My life has always been
like this bus.

975
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,850
It's always on a set route,
a set schedule.

976
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,120
But then, some days,

977
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,420
I felt a sudden urge
to just swerve off course...

978
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,930
from my designated path.

979
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,100
I was curious to see
what else was out there.

980
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,670
But since I'm a mother,

981
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,570
I thought things like that
were a luxury I couldn't afford.

982
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,510
I don't regret making that choice,

983
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,480
but at some point,

984
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,310
I saw you start to shrink
into yourself.

985
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,620
I felt like you were becoming
just like me.

986
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,390
And even though I hated seeing that,

987
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,590
a part of me thought it was
the right way to live.

988
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,290
That way, you'd be less likely
to get hurt.

989
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,660
I jumped to conclusions
and treated your life like my own.

990
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,370
But your life is your own.

991
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:12,200
You're just a passenger who gets off
when you reach your stop.

992
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,780

994
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,080
So...

995
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,720
whether you get into crypto
or whatever else,

996
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,490
you go as far as you want to go,
to your heart's content.

997
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:35,860
Earlier, I wasn't thinking straight,
and I acted terribly.

998
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,870
I'll figure out the money,
so don't you worry about a thing.

999

Always trying to act tough.

1000
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,010
What was that?

1001
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,510
I know it's a classic mom move
to act all tough.

1002
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,780
You happen to have
an even tougher daughter,

1003
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:57,280
so you can drop that act now.

1004
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,650
You're not going on that trip.

1005
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:01,350
What?

1006
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,790

for Dad's surgery,

1007
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,330
so you're not going.

Enough with the dramatic voice.
Just drive.

1011
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,440
I've had a lethal dose of cringe
for one day. That's plenty.

1012
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,440
More than enough.

1013
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:25,910
I'm sorry.

1014
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,080

Gosh.

1017
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,720
This is too late to be here,
isn't it?

1018
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:38,650
It's...

1019
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,220
Right.

1020
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:45,160
I should probably
make an appointment...

1021
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,490
and come back
some other time, right?

1022
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,360
I apologize for the intrusion.

1023
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,170
I'll get going, then.

1024
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,370
Are you really going
to do this to me?

1025
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,750
I'd have caved if you had just tried
one more time,

1026
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:11,850
and you couldn't even do it
that one time?

1027
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,160
So you'll stop being mad?

1028
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,660
Gosh, look at that smile.

1029
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:25,260
As if smiling is
going to work on me. Please.

1030
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,030
Won't it?

1031
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,670
Are you kidding me?

1032
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,340
Of course, it's working.

1033

01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:42,940
Wait, no.

1049
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,580
You have a name, don't you?

1050
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,110
Da Hae.

1051
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,080
We'll meet very soon.

1052
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:55,620
There are so many fun things
in the world,

1053
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,290
and so many delicious things to eat.

1054
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,930
And I'll make sure
you get to experience it all.

1055
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:02,560
It's okay if you're not
a great student...

1056
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,340
Though it'd be great if you were.

1057
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:19,580
So don't you worry about
things like tuition...

1058
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,150
and just focus on your studies...

1059
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,050
Actually, no.

1060
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:28,450
Just be healthy.

1061
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,690
As long as you're healthy,

1062
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,090
Mom will make everything happen
for you.

1063
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,130
I'll give you everything, okay?

1064
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:45,500
Ever since then, for a long time,
I had just one thing on my mind.

1065
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:48,010
What was I supposed to say?

1066
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:49,880
I'm going in now.

1067
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,010
- To you, who made the promises...
- Is it yummy?

1068
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,320
and gave your heart so completely,

1069
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,290
- Da Hae.
- what could I ever give in return?

1070
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:04,620
How could I ever show you
how much I love you?

1071
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,390
And then, I knew.

1072
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:10,200
- This is it.
- Peekaboo, my sweet Da Hae.

1073
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:11,530
This was the only way.

1074
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,700
From now on,
for the rest of my life,

1075
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,600
this is how I'll profess
my love to you.

1076
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,270
Mommy!

1077
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,570
Da Hae.

1078
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,040
Goodness!

1079
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,710
Did you say "Mommy?"

1080
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,310
Mommy!

1081
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,050
Mommy!

1082
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:30,620
Mommy!

1083
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,460
(To the Moon)

1084
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,810
I have to go pick up my boyfriend.

1085
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,380
Why am I always the one who worries?

1086
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,720
Why am I always the one
he'll see next time?

1087
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,650
Is this how
Assistant Manager Oh's crush ends?

1088
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:07,790
Just trust me on this.

1089
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,020
The presentation's product is wrong.

1090
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,860
What we need is
a soldier's mentality.

1091
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,230
Why does our relationship
have to be such a secret?

1092
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,730
What's that?

1093
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:20,730
It's nothing.

1094
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,340
Little surprises make dating fun.

1095
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,940
It's Jung Da Hee.

1096
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,310
Da Hee!

1097
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,840
What on earth did you do?

1098
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,110
What in the world
did you do to the cookies?

1099
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,480
