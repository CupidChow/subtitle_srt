4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,380
What's going on? It's so crowded.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,990
Where is she, though?

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
What?

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,520
Hey, Kim Ji Song!

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,530
What're you doing?
Why didn't you get on?

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,000
You're such a traitor.
You said you'd never do crypto!

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,230
Well, things just kind of...

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,030
That's why I'm telling you
to just get on.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,130
No way.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,300
What if it's even worse
than the torment we're in now?

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,870
What could be worse than the torment
we're already in?

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,740
- No way. I'm not going.
- Come on!

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,910
The train will be departing shortly.

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,080
All passengers,
please take your seats...

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,390
- and fasten your seatbelts.
- Hey, the train's about to leave!

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm not going. I'm not!

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,160
I'm not going. I'm not!

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,360
Hey... Hey, Ji Song!

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,170
Welcome, passengers.

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,610
Our train has departed
from a miserable reality...

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,540
where the value of your labor
goes unappreciated.

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,640
What?

26
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,680
Eun Sang, what is all this?
Are you cosplaying?

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,480
There is a slight risk of injury
during our journey.

28
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,990
Injury?

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,690
Ouch, that stings!

30
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,990
What? A mark from a 20 percent loss.

31
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,460
- You're already down?
- Down?

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,800
Still, you've got it easy.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
See that guy over there?

34
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,530
He's down 30,000 dollars.

35
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,800
And that woman over there.

36
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
She's down 40,000 dollars.

37
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,570
And me...

38
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,210
What's wrong? Are you okay?

39
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,010
Fifty... I just lost 50,000 dollars.

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Oh my gosh!

41
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,820
Eun Sang, stop the train!
Someone's hurt here!

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,780
No! We can't stop!

43
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,250
No, this thing can't stop.
Just keep going.

44
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,460
That's right!
Let's ride this out to the end!

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,830
- Yes, I agree.
- Yes, I agree.

46
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,430
- I agree.
- I agree.

47
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,230
- I agree.
- I agree.

48
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,000
Our train will not leave
anyone behind...

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,100
and will go
to our final destination, the moon.

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,640
So I suggest you brace yourselves.

51
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,910
- What's that?
- Why did the light go out?

52
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,240
And the consequences of your choices
are yours and yours alone.

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,720
- Gosh.
- What is this?

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,420
- When did we get here?
- Ladies and gentlemen.

55
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,930
You can do it! Ganbare!

56
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,990
Jiayou!

57
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,200
Let's all shout it together.

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,630
To the moon!

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,930
Let's go! Let's go!

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
To the moon!

61
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,870
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

62
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,610
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

63
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,210
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

64
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,980
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,510
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

66
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,050
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

67
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,650
- Like you mean it!
- To the moon!

68
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,820
- Louder! To the moon!
- To the moon!

69
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,850
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

70
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,450
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

71
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,920
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

72
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,760
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

73
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,330
- To the moon!
- Moon...

74
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,060
- To the moon!
- Moon!

75
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,260
- To the moon!
- Moon...

76
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,770
- To the moon!
- Open the door!

77
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,870
Moon...

78
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,000
Da Hae!

79
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,040
Gosh, what are you doing?
I said open the door! The door!

80
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,670
- Hey!
- Oh, right.

81
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,770
I forgot Mom was coming. Shoot.

82
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,350
(Episode 4:
The Reason I Want to Be Rich)

83
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,400
Mom, come over here.

84
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,570
Look.

85
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,110
It's the threshold.

86
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,840
There is a threshold!

87
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,220
No way. It's really going up.

88
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,960
What are you staring at?

89
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,990
What? Oh, it's nothing.

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,230
So? It's not too shabby, right?

91
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,860
I guess I didn't do too bad a job
raising you.

92
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,570
You must've worked so hard
to be living in a place like this.

93
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,070
- I'm so proud of you, sweetie.
- Oh, come on. It's no big deal.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,770
You're staying for dinner, right?

95
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,140
- Just whip something up.
- Okay.

96
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,240
So what are all these boxes?

97
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,110
Oh, just stuff I'm throwing out.

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,580
Just some books
I don't read anymore,

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,650
and old photos from my childhood.

100
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,950
What?
Why would you throw away photos?

101
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,750
If there's no space, hang them up.

102
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,750
Okay.

103
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,690
What? What's that?

104
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,260
No, Mom, don't! You can't use nails!

105
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,600
- No!
- You scared me. What's wrong?

106
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,130
What do you think you're doing, Mom?
You can't hammer nails in a rental.

107
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
This isn't even my place.

108
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,940
Oh, no. Did you damage the surface?

109
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,810
You don't think the neighbors heard,
do you?

110
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh, what am I going to do?
Gosh, why would you even...

111
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,780
- Don't be such a chicken.
- What?

112
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,290
Let's just eat.

113
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,300
- Oh, by the way.
- Yes?

114
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,940
Can you make me a YouTube account?

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,670
YouTube? You're on that stuff now?

116
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,210
I want to play music while I drive.

117
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,780
It's nice and helps me stay awake.

118
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,780
What about a profile picture?

119
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,880
Check my album.
There are plenty of photos in there.

120
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,950
Okay.

121
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,420
What?
Isn't this just a picture of the TV?

122
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,730
Why are they all pictures like this?

123
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,790
Seriously? You want to use this
as your profile picture?

124
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
What's wrong with it? It's pretty.

125
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,430
Hey, if you just glance at it,
doesn't it look like I was there?

126
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,970
Not even a little bit.

127
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,470
Gosh, look at this one.
It's from the home shopping channel.

128
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,010
I'm too busy to go anywhere,
so it's nice to feel like I did.

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,180
Too busy? Yes, right.

130
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,410
Mom, get out and get some fresh air.

131
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,020
This fall, go see the fall foliage
or something.

132
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,120
Oh, please.
Only rich people have time for that.

133
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,790
Listen, you have to live
within your means.

134
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,990
There's no point in being greedy
for things you can't have.

135
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,830
Give it here.

136
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,270
Mountains...

137
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,040
Mountains are nice.

138
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
Yes.

139
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,770
Gosh, how pretty.

140
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,070
Right?

141
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,110
A side gig? On a weekend?

142
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,650
You have to use your downtime
to save up your crypto ammo.

143
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,080
Instead of wasting money on junk,
you should get a side gig, too.

144
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,490
You and Ji Song both.

145
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
A side gig? Yes, right.

146
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,060
She's probably passed out cold
right now.

147
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,570
If only you weren't so gorgeous.

148
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,630
I wouldn't have to deal with this.

149
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

150
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
Darn it!

151
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,750
It's her 200-day anniversary
with her boyfriend.

152
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,750
Which means she's crossing borders
as we speak.

153
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,890
Is she on a world tour or something?
I bet pop stars travel less.

154
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,160
Anyway, what's up?
Is something wrong?

155
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,530
You sound a little down.

156
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm just feeling
a little unlike myself.

157
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,130
Listen, drinking in a mood like this
is a recipe for disaster.

158
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,870
Don't go getting blackout drunk
and pull the "I don't remember" bit.

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,370
- Just go home and call it a night.
- You the designated driver?

160
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,340
Hey, my customer's here.
Talk to you later.

161
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,610
- Hi, did you call for a driver?
- Yes, to Sangdo-dong.

162
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,700
Sir.

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,430
Sorry,
I can't drive a car like this.

164
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,670
An accident means the Aoji Coal Mine
and a lifetime of work to repay it.

165
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,410
Come on, it's just...

166
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,740
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,010
Look, I'll pay you double!

168
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,090
Be on your way, Comrade.
And shut the door.

169
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,150
Okay.

170
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
You up?

171
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Gosh, what's with this moron?

172
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,630
Darn it.

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,510
One beer at a karaoke bar
can't hurt, right?

176
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,350
Gosh.

177
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
I'll never drive foreign cars again.

178
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,190
I was so tense,
my whole body's aching.

179
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,220
Gosh, must be nice.

180
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
Some people get to drive supercars,

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,730
while others ride a packed bus.

182
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,160
I can't stand it!

183
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,600
Gosh, I seriously hate my job
so much!

184
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Then how are you
going to make money?

185
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,500
Especially since you refuse
to invest in crypto.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,140
Gosh, is crypto your only answer?
I'm so sick of it!

187
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,240
- Fine, go get rich then. Happy?
- Thanks.

188
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,480
So, is there anything you'd do
if you got rich?

189
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Hey.

190
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,880
When you get rich,
you focus on getting even richer.

191
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,690
The richer you are,
the more you want.

192
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,420
You just think about spending it.

193
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,420
Humor me then. What would you do?

194
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,330
I don't know. If I were rich,

195
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,690
I'd first toss
nearly-empty toothpaste tubes.

196
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,970
It's so hard to squeeze
an empty tube every morning.

197
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,130
I feel like
I'll burst a blood vessel.

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,300
Oh, and I'd stop licking the lids
on yogurt cups.

199
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,570
That's my idea of flexing.

200
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,840
- Oh, hey, you're here.
- Yes, hey.

201
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,910
Oh, hey.

202
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,540
Hey.
What were you guys talking about?

203
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,580
Oh, she was asking what I'd do
if I got rich.

204
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,280
What about you? If you got rich...

205
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,850
What?

206
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,190
- Does anyone else smell burning?
- What?

207
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,690
If I were rich,

208
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,990
the first thing I'd do
is hammer a nail in my wall.

209
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,030
A nail? Oh, right. You're renting.

210
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,400
Yes, you can't put nails
in the wall.

211
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,630
Seriously? Is that all
you can think of if you got rich?

212
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,340
- So what would you do?
- Me?

213
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,300
Well, I...

214
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,310
I'd be in a penthouse
on the Han River,

215
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,610
sipping on a 5,000-dollar bottle
of Dom Pérignon.

216
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,550
And then I'd be on the phone
with my dad, like this.

217
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,550
Father, I refuse
a loveless arranged marriage.

218
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,750
You have to let me live my own life!

219
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,360
And I'd dramatically throw my bag
onto a water buffalo leather sofa,

220
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,520
and say...

221
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,830
Gosh, life is so utterly empty.

222
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,100
It has gotten a bit warmer, though,
hasn't it?

223
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,330
Yes, you're right.
I guess spring is finally here.

224
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,170
Hey, stop ignoring me.

225
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,440
Around 2 a.m. today, a fire started
at a motel in the Gwanak District.

226
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,040
- Over 20 people...
- Looks like there was a fire.

227
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,380
had smoke inhalation
or injuries as the fire spread.

228
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,610
This is Kim So Young reporting.

229
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,180
A fire broke out at a 9-story motel
in Seoul's Gwanak District at 2 a.m.

230
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,450
Forty guests evacuated the building
when the fire started,

231
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,730
and seven were taken to the hospital
for smoke inhalation.

232
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,860
Suddenly,
the emergency alarms went off.

233
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,060
And smoke was everywhere...
I was so startled,

234
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,730
I didn't even have time to change.
I just ran out like this.

235
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,700
What? Wait a second.
Aren't those drunk eyes familiar?

236
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,610
Do they know what caused the fire?

237
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,540
Hey, isn't that Da Hae?

238
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,440
Hey! What'd you do while drunk...

239
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,050
I can't believe this.

240
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,680
What?

241
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,980
This is you, isn't it, Ms. Round?

242
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,990
Right?

243
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,020
No, but how did you...

244
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,530
What do you mean, "how?"
It's obviously you.

245
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,200
If they're going to blur a face,
they should at least do it better.

246
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,800
What is this? So sloppy.

247
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,200
Here, look at this.

248
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,970
I can totally see your face
right through it.

249
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,640
Look at all these comments.

250
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,970
"The betrayal of the mosaic. LOL."

251
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,110
"The motel girl's face is
now exposed."

252
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,250
"I know that feeling
of an office worker..."

253
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,980
"wanting to set everything on fire."

254
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,020
You don't want to burn it all down
because of me, do you?

255
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,250
No, of course not. Gosh.

256
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,060
But, Mr. Ko, I'm surprised
you even watch the morning news.

257
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,960
It was on the company message board.

258
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,860
Hoppang Bite posted it.

259
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,900
What? The company message board?

260
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,570
Gosh, that psycho Hoppang Bite.
I swear I'm going to punch him...

261
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,700
Don't worry too much.

262
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,210
The admin already took it down.

263
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,540
You can't slander someone like that.

264
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,580
Besides, it barely got any views.

265
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,650
But you know, Da Hae,
you really should get married.

266
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,950
What? Why?

267
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,520
For a single woman...

268
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,220
to have her face plastered
everywhere like this.

269
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,990
Tell your boyfriend to hurry up
and propose. Okay?

270
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,020
I actually wasn't with my boyfriend.

271
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,030
Then who?

272
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Who was it?

273
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,230
So who was it?

274
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,030
Why'd you just run off
without telling us?

275
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,740
(Huge Mistake)

276
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,970
(Huge Mistake)

277
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,640
Who did you make
this "huge mistake" with?

278
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,210
You're really not going to tell us?

279
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,750
At least give us a hint.

280
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,350
Wait, are you obsessed with
a certain "type" again?

281
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,290
Type? What type?

282
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,120
- Rich? Connected? Or just trouble?
- Veins.

283
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,760
Oh, that's right.

284
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,530
You're a total vein freak,
aren't you?

285
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,930
I'm not a freak.

286
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,070
Hey, it's not that I just
like any veins.

287
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,570
I like the veins you get
from hard labor.

288
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,110
For example,
like the guys on "Extreme Jobs."

289
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,450
A man whose bulging veins prove
how hard he's worked.

290
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,850
Isn't that sexy?

291
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,380
You can see
the unwavering determination...

292
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,750
not to let his family starve.

293
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,920
Darn. Gosh, that's so hot.

294
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,900
I'm all for sexy, but I'm not sure
about the "unwavering" part.

295
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,270
Hey, you just don't get it.

296
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,710
Because of my dad, for me,
hardworking equals sexy.

297
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,440
If you like hard workers so much,
why are you messing with crypto?

298
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,380
You should earn your money
the hard way too, then.

299
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,480
Ideals and reality are different,
you know?

300
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,250
For me, no matter how hard I work,
it's always an extreme struggle.

301
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,120
That's why I took a drastic step
like crypto.

302
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,390
So, was the guy last night
your hardworking, sexy type?

303
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,290
Was he?

304
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,300
Gosh, you guys.

305
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,770
That's...

306
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,810
My privacy.

307
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,250
Private?
I ought to pry it out of you.

308
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,820
Fine, it was just a
drunken fender-bender.

309
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,450
I'll never see him again.

310
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,890
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

311
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,220
With this going on,
you two have unfinished business.

312
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Darn it.

313
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,730

to grab my clothes!")

Gosh, it didn't even have
that many views in the morning.

This is what you call
the miracle of the algorithm.

321
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,120
I'm going to teach
these trolls a lesson.

322
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,250
- What are you going to do?
- What? You want me to just...

323
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,320
let them run their mouths?

324
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
I'm going to post a reply.

325
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,230
Judging someone's looks or body
is not the mark of a mature person.

326
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,230
- Especially their sex life.
- Hey.

327
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,600
It's an extremely private matter.

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,470
So please stop
with the harassing comments.

329
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,710
There.

330
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,340
Oh, a reply!

331
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,610
"Piss off, geezer."

332
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
"Geezer?"
What's that supposed to mean?

333
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,250
- It's slang for an old person.
- Oh, what a clever little brat.

Why is their frontal lobe melting?

336
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,820
It means winding you up is so funny
that it melts their brain.

with facts, and you've been gutted.

Wait, how are the replies so fast?

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,110
- Tell them to slow down.
- Stop!

345
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,550
- Hold on a second. Oh, here.
- The perforated line! Right here!

346
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,850
Oh, you're right.

347
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,850
What's the perforated line for?

348
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,350
It means not to post below this.

349
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,650
Basically, a stop.

350
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,150
Wait, what does that even mean?

351
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,420
Forget it. I don't want to know.

352
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,520
Right.

353
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,130
What'd you expect
from the pager era?

354
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,360
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

355
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,060
You?

356
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,130
You're talking to Kim Ji Song,

357
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,870
the one rigorously trained
in every kind of SNS to be...

358
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,200
a professional slacker.

359
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
And you're proud of that?

360
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,140
First,
I'll get the commenter's info.

361
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,170
Let's see what I'm dealing with.

362
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,510
I swear, I was about to
go for the jugular...

363
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,180
- Then go for it.
- Go for what?

364
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,150
Get married.
Get married twice! Three times!

365
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,320
You crazy girl!
Did you already dump Wei Lin?

366
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,460
Dump him?
What are you talking about?

367
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,460
My gosh! Talk about a complete 180.

368
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,660
You were just going on and on
about getting married.

369
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,960
But why would I ever dump Wei Lin?

370
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,530
- Be honest with me.
- About what?

371
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,630
- Wei Lin...
- What about him?

372
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,170
- He isn't real, is he?
- What? Wei Lin?

373
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,100
Mom, don't lie. It's you!

374
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,040
The username is totally yours.
And I changed your profile picture.

375
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,040
So what if it is?

376
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,750
My daughter is
getting cursed online.

377
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,550
What kind of mother
would just stand by?

378
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,520
Those jerks.

379
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,090
If someone's daughter goes
to a motel or builds it,

380
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,420
what business is it of theirs?

381
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,920
Can you stop with the motel talk?

382
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,960
Why are you getting so worked up?

383
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,230
I'll handle my own business.
So just stay out of it.

384
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,660
Okay, fine.

385
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
But what about last night?

386
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,870
I was with my friends.
We just hung out all night.

387
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,010
- So don't get any funny ideas...
- Are you hurt?

388
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
What?

389
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,740
I asked if you were hurt anywhere,
sweetheart.

390
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,980
- No.
- Okay, good. I'm hanging up.

391
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,190
(Mom)

392
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,600
No way. Are you kidding me?

393
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,600
How long has he been standing there?

394
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,110
Why weren't you answering my calls?

395
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,250
Oh, where did it go? Shoot.

396
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,950
- Gosh, where did it go?
- Did you drop something?

397
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,690
Yes. I dropped something.

398
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,490
I can't seem to find
something of mine.

399
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,430
- Where could it be?
- It must be you common courtesy.

400
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
Excuse me?

401
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,840
You know, the common courtesy
of greeting your boss.

402
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,140
I think that's what you dropped.

403
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Oh, right.

404
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,810
Good morning.

405
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,550
Do I look like
I'm having a good one?

406
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,150
You're all banged up. How?

407
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,520
So you're a celebrity now. How?

408
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,460
Yes? You want my autograph
or something?

409
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,800
- Are you mocking me?
- On second thought, no autograph.

410
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,030
Only your mom is on your side.

411
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,770
Why were you so mad at her?

412
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Why were you eavesdropping
on my conversation?

413
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,040
There's something I'm curious about.

414
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,280
May I ask?

415
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,340
Gosh.

416
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,950
Dr. Ham.

417
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,090
This is a professional workplace.

418
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,990
Even if you're my superior,
please refrain from this at work.

419
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,530
And interfering in my private life
after hours is...

420
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,960
- Are you keeping that as a pet?
- Keeping what?

421
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,010
What is this!

422
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,210
Oh my gosh! It's on me! Get it off!

423
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,380
Private life?

424
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,580
Oh no. Where'd it go?

425
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,280
- Where is it?
- Okay.

426
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,350
Where did it go?

427
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
Darn it.

428
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,460
So, have you ever caught a big one?

429
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,160
Well... Let's see. Bigeye tuna.

430
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,870
I'm writing to complain about
the motel fire segment this morning.

431
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,240
A civilian's face was badly blurred,
violating their privacy.

432
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,210
This is a serious data breach.
Is this for real?

433
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,310
If these mistakes keep happening,

434
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,020
News Breed will lose credibility.
Thank you.

435
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,420
(Post)

436
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,390
If this keeps up, I'm unsubscribing.

437
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,690
Facts. Can't argue with that. Right?

438
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,960
Such a frustrating response.
Fix it ASAP.

439
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
(Choose file)

440
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,300
(Submit, processing)

441
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,370
(Submission complete)

442
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,310
(Averages)

443
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,480
I just posted a complaint
on the news station's message board.

444
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,380
I told them to re-blur the video
and disable the comments.

445
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,510
We can't help who's already seen it,

446
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,280
but we have to do
some damage control.

447
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,720
Eun Sang, I love you.

448
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,490
Ditch that jerk from yesterday.
Why are you taking all the heat?

449
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,360
Bulging veins mean nothing.

450
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,630
Totally.

451
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,160
There are more than enough
veins in the world.

452
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,570
You're nuts.
Do you know whose veins they are?

453
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,510
Starting from the first,
it's Seo Kang Jun, Jung Hae In,

454
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,210
Jung Yong Hwa,
Lee Min Ki, and Byeon Woo Seok.

455
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,740
And for the record, this last one
belongs to my Wei Lin.

456
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,950
(Kim Ji Song)

457
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,180
(By. Ji Song)

458
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,820
Then why is your name written
on Wei Lin's arm?

459
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,720
I have to mark my territory,
obviously.

460
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,730
Think of it as an artist
signing their masterpiece.

461
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,030
You're the type
who goes on vacation...

462
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,730
and scribbles graffiti
all over a national treasure.

463
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,300
(You're mine.)

464
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,770
What? What's this?

465
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,140
What memory was that?

466
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,940
Oh, goodness.

467
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Hello. This is Kim So Young,
a reporter from News Breed.

468
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,830
I'm calling about your message
asking for a follow-up.

469
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,230
So we've taken down all the videos
that were posted online.

470
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,200
We'll contact the person involved
to apologize directly.

471
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,170
Yes, I'd appreciate that.
I'll consider the matter resolved.

472
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,570
I'll hang up now.

473
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,080
- Sorry, are you Ji Sang's mom?
- Who?

474
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,050
This is reporter Kim So Young.
I used to work on "Press File."

475
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,790
I covered the daycare bus accident.

476
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,550
I still had your number saved.

477
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:51,830
His father and I spoke several times
during the follow-up interviews.

478
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,000
Have you been doing okay?

479
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,940
Oh, yes.

480
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,710
I've been...

481
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,180
just fine.

482
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,250
My honey's veins are definitely
the hottest.

483
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,020
I said I don't know.
Her face was blurred out.

484
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,720
Oh, come on.
I'm telling you, it's her.

485
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,790
But that wasn't Da Hae...

486
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,060
Ji Song, what do you mean?

487
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,470
That news story.

488
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,930
Weren't you talking about
the blurred face?

489
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,340
Yes, that's right.

490
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,870
About Chae Hee Gyu's latest scandal.

491
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,910
But the actress's face is blurred,
so I can't figure out who it is.

492
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,280
Oh, I thought you meant...

493
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,180
- That's obviously Min Se Ra.
- What?

494
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,420
Isn't it Park Se Mi?

495
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,420
Excuse me? No, it isn't.

496
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,350
What do you mean, no?
The clothes prove it's her.

497
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,090
- What would you know about it?
- Excuse me?

498
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,600
Wait, are you dissing my knowledge
of celebrity dating and fashion?

499
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,130
For your information,

500
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,400
I'm so good I can identify a guy
just by looking at his veins.

501
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,810
What is she even talking about?

502
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,850
Want to bet ten bucks on it?

503
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
You're on.

504
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,400
All right, everyone, look closely.

505
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,970
If you look at this article,
she's an actress in a recent drama.

506
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,770
For recently-ended dramas,
TV, cable, and web series make six.

507
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,310
Of those, only four of them starred
an actress in her twenties.

508
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,610
That puts a total of four actresses
on our list of suspects.

509
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,980
Let's examine the part of the photo
that isn't blurred,

510
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,150
the woman's wrist.

511
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,560
That's not a bracelet.
It's a hair tie.

512
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,990
You thought it was
a bracelet, right?

513
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,220
It's an easy mistake to make.

514
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,260
A limited edition by Bottega Veneta
for this season's product...

515
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,870
That means our suspect must be
someone who can tie their hair?

516
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,300
So that narrows it down to two.

517
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,570
And now I see the smoking gun.

518
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,640
Right here. The ring she's wearing.
This one.

519
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,010
It's Roji Jewelry's Opeuroom Ring.

520
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,080
The group Min Se Ra is in are
for ambassadors of Roji Jewelry.

521
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,520
She probably got it for free, right?

522
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,350
So...

523
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,860
I'm sure the person in this scandal
is Min Se Ra.

524
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,490
Ji Song, you can actually see that?

525
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,930
It's my absolute dream item.

526
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
I guess since I've looked at
so many photos of it,

527
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,670
I could spot it from a mile away.

528
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,780
Oh, I guess it really is Min Se Ra.
What?

529
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,040
Look, an unblurred photo
just popped up.

530
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Oh my gosh.

531
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,780
Gosh, Ji Song, you're amazing.

532
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,520
I mean, how do you know
this so well?

533
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,950
Oh, it's nothing.

534
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,590
So, ten bucks, right?

535
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,260
Oh my, that ring.

536
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,630
Isn't that the same one
Min Se Ra was wearing?

537
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,700
What?

538
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,760
It is.

539
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,600
Oh my, you're right.
I didn't even notice I had it on.

540
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,640
That must be so expensive.

541
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,040
Of course it is.

542
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,480
- It's not like I can't afford it.
- It's gorgeous.

543
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,350
Ji Song, you're creeping me out.

544
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,220
How can you know so much about it?

545
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,550
Here.

546
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,730
(Assistant Manager Oh Dong Gyu)

547
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,000
It's not like she was testing me.
She obviously had the ring herself,

548
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,540
so why pretend and
make a fool out of me?

549
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,070
She totally made a fool out of me!

550
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,910
- It's not even funny.
- Ji Song, calm down.

551
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,410
If it's ridiculous but not funny,

552
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,180
what does that even mean? What?

553
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,050
Why does she keep messing with me?

554
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,960
Why is she trying to mess with me?

555
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,120
- She's feeding you?
- Darn it!

556
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,730
Someone who feeds you
is a good person.

557
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,660
- Why are you mad?
- No, that's not what I meant!

558
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,270
Oh? You were here?

559
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,910
Ji Song, can I give you a hand?

560
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,980
Hello.
I'm Oh Dong Gyu, Ji Song's coworker.

561
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,380
Do you need an interpreter?

562
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,490
Oh, hello. You speak Chinese?

563
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,220
Oh, Assistant Manager Oh,
you speak Chinese?

564
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,560
And it sounds like
you're really good, too.

565
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,930
I worked at our branch in China
until two years ago,

566
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,800
- so I learned Chinese to manage.
- Oh, right.

567
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,740
But, don't get the wrong idea.

568
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,910
It's not like I can't get over you,

569
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,540
and I'm still trying to
hit on you or anything.

570
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,580
I just really wanted to help
in any way I could.

571
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
That's it?

572
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,060
Why was that so short?

573
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,490
What?

574
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,130
How could you sum up all my pain
in so few words?

575
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,800
- Well...
- It's okay, Ji Song.

576
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,300
Stay strong.

577
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,480
And why is he pitying me now?
What was that? What did you say?

578
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,880
I just said...

579
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,620
that because you're broke,
your pride is completely shattered.

580
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,650
That was the short version.

581
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,360
I see.
So that's what it all boils down to.

582
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,100
You're right.

583
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,830
My pride...

584
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,970
is completely shattered.

585
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,810
This product is getting buzz online,
so it's a shame about its placement.

586
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,550
Oh, you're right.

587
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,150
Can you ask for a spot
on a main aisle?

588
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,520
It was bumped for another promotion,

589
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,020
but I'll raise it again next week.

590
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,290
I hear it's a war for shelf space.
It must be tough.

591
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:37,070
But Pepero Sticks are selling well,
so we have some breathing room.

592
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,970
By the way, Da Hee,
are you dating Dr. Ham?

593
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Excuse me?

594
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,940
No. Why do you ask all of a sudden?

595
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,410
An employee at headquarters
saw the two of you together,

596
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,850
and said you looked great together,
so I was just wondering.

597
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,420
No, we're not.

598
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,350
Besides, I've never even been
alone with Dr. Ham.

599
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,960
We're only together in meetings,
and those are always packed.

600
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,160
Right?

601
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,560
Yes, well...

602
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,600
Oh, then that's what it is.

603
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,270
You're both such knockouts...

604
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,700
that you're
the only two that stood out.

605
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,470
Like Kang Dong Won and Jun Ji Hyun
outshining us mere mortals.

606
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,170
Oh, no. You're being too kind.

607
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,910
But Da Hee, are you really
not interested at all?

608
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,350
I think you and Dr. Ham
would be perfect for each other.

609
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,580
I'm not sure about that.

610
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,250
So many people at the company
who have their eyes on Dr. Ham.

611
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,560
Really? Don't tell me...
Da Hae, you too?

612
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,130
"Don't tell me... Da Hae, you too?"

613
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,300
What was that?
As if to say, "Someone like you?"

614
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,170
Sorry, but someone like Dr. Ham
isn't really my type.

615
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,110
That's a smart move.
A guy that perfect is just trouble.

616
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,210
Da Hae, are you okay?

617
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,280
- What? About what?
- About what they said...

618
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,790
You mean about Dr. Ham?

619
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,790
Oh, please, I'm fine.
I'm not that delusional.

620
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,760
I know we're not a perfect picture.
Why would I be hurt by that?

621
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,670
Birds of a feather flock together.
Like attracts like. It's science.

622
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,500
- I get it. You think I don't know?
- No, I...

623
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,740
That's not what I meant.

624
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,480
I meant the new product list
you have to finish by tomorrow.

625
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,750
I was asking if you were okay
handling that by yourself.

626
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,550
Oh, right. That.

627
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,190
You know what they say
about protesting too much.

628
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,860
So maybe you do have your eye
on Dr. Ham after all.

629
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,390
Gosh, I said I'm not.

630
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,170
I'm sorry. I was just kidding.

631
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,070
No. It's fine,
you don't have to apologize.

632
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,470
Oh, look, we're at the bus stop.
You should go on ahead.

633
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,910
Okay.

634
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,120
Jung Da Hae, seriously.
What is wrong with you?

635
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,560
Do we really have to do this?
Is this our only option?

636
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,330
Look,

637
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,930
I used to think I wanted to be rich
for a penthouse and Dom Pérignon.

638
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,870
Right. But it's not just that,
is it?

639
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,740
I need to buy a ring, too.

640
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,910
Excuse me?

641
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,210
I'll get one
that's way prettier and shinier...

642
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,680
than Assistant Manager Jo's.

643
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,080
And then I'm going to
rub it in her face.

644
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,580
What are you, a magpie?
Why are you always so...

645
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,550
obsessed with pretty
and shiny things?

646
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,090
Eun Sang...

647
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,490
Do I really have to tell you
that story again?

648
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,560
It's okay, you don't have to.

649
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,130
It goes back to my painful past.

650
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,670
Ever since I was a little girl,
I was always a bit different.

651
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,510
We're going to get some chicken
because it's a hot day.

652
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,040
If we search you and find any money,
you know what happens.

653
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,010
What's this?

654
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,550
Hey.

655
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,850
I knew it!

656
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,620
Hey, let go of me!

657
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,520
This ring,

658
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,830
Hyo Ri wore this on TV yesterday!
Oh, my gosh. It's so pretty!

659
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,300
Where'd you get it?

660
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,230
How much was it?
Is it real gold? Or plated?

661
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,870
This psycho!

662
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:39,170
I just always loved pretty things.
I guess I was born with a good eye.

663
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,840
But there was another reason, too.

664
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,480
Back then, our house was a total...

665
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,680
dump.

666
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:51,590
My dad was always away for business,
so my mom was alone and very lonely.

667
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,220
She eventually found something
to pour her heart into,

668
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,790
but of all things,

669
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,930
it had to be a cult.

670
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,130
Come to think of it, my life's motto
was basically formed then.

671
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,430
I made a vow to myself every day.

672
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,800
That I'd only have beautiful things,
not stinking trash like this,

673
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,940
but expensive things
that smell good.

674
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,310
Absolutely nothing else.

675
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,380
That's what I'd fill my life with.

676
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,020
Ji Song.

677
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,890
But then...

678
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,700
- Mom...
- My mom left me...

679
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,330
- Mom!
- for her cult leader.

680
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Mom!

681
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,270
My dad was
the only family I had left,

682
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,440
and get this...

683
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,910
He went and betrayed me too.

684
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,680
Why would you quit your job?

685
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,010
Why did you donate it all away?

686
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,550
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

687
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,920
We come into the world with nothing,
and die with nothing. That's life.

688
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,390
We even leave this body behind.

689
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,830
Then leave your credit card.

690
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,730
At least leave the house!

691
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,200
Just stay with me, Dad!

692
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,170
Don't go!

693
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,800
Dad!

694
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,110
Talk about a tragic backstory,
right?

695
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,190
My childhood was just one big scar.

696
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,290
It's a real tearjerker, seriously.

697
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,160
I can manage to listen
without crying.

698
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,600
This is your go-to sob story
whenever you're drunk.

699
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,030
You expect me to cry
every single time?

700
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You're heartless!

701
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,170
Another one, please.

702
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,240
That's exactly why you need
to make money.

703
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,210
Maybe making money would help you
heal those wounds, don't you think?

704
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,420
- What if we did crypto together...
- It's a cult!

705
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,320
- What?
- As far as I'm concerned,

706
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,960
crypto is no different than a cult.

707
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,030
You can't see it or touch it.

708
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,400
You don't even know if it's real.

709
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,670
People who get sucked into things
that aren't even tangible...

710
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,340
are a lost cause, seriously.

711
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,210
Hey.

712
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,910
Then is that 1,250-dollar ring
you saw any less hopeless?

713
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,750
- Is something so costly worthwhile?
- Oh, that ring.

714
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,050
It was so pretty, though.

715
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,420
I can't take it anymore.

716
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,320
I can't help it.

717
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,890
That little thing
I think it's meant to be mine.

718
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,530
I have to put it on my finger.

719
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,270
Let's go buy the ring.

720
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,170
I'm going to go buy that ring!

721
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,800
Let's go! Let's go buy the ring.

722
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,140
- Hey!
- Let's go!

723
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,310
You impossible girl, sit down.
Sit! Just sit down!

724
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,380
Sit down. Sorry about that.

725
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,010
I told you to sit down!

726
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,450
You guys are out drinking?

727
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,580
I'll see if I can make it.

728
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,350
Oh, come on!
Just come, even if it's late.

729
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,260
Gosh, this girl.
She's throwing a fit over that ring.

730
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,960
I can't handle her alone.

731
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,290
Tell me about it.

732
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,930
- It's better not to get greedy.
- What?

733
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,570
It's true, though.
When you want what you can't have,

734
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,870
you just end up with a bruised ego,

735
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,140
and your feelings get hurt, right?

736
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,610
Wait. Are you talking about Ji Song
or about yourself?

737
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,750
Is something going on with you?

738
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,710
What's the number?
Tell me. I'll write it down.

739
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,280
Okay.

740
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,190
What was that?

741
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,750
Okay.

742
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,530
- What is this memory?
- What? What did you say?

743
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,930
Oh, it's nothing. Never mind.

744
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:57,930
Hold on a second.

745
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,640
You're off the clock, right?
So I can intrude for a moment?

746
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,510
We need to talk.
Go clean up and meet me in an hour.

747
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,260
It's a masterpiece.
A true work of art.

748
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,800
Something that good deserves
an autograph.

749
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,910
(Claimed! Artistic genius,
National treasure, Smoking hot)

750
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,280
(Claimed! Artistic genius,
National treasure, Smoking hot)

751
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,350
He can't wash this off!

752
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,320
He can't take off the bandage.

753
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,350
- No way.
- What?

754
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,790
What can't you take off?

755
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,960
Listen, I've got to go.
I'll call you back.

756
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,090
Stay right there. Don't wash up.
I'm on my way.

757
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Wait! Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

758
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,130
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Driver! Stop!

759
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,470
Sir, wait! Please stop the bus!

760
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,900
Hey, Da...

761
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,710
(Kim So Young, News Breed)

762
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,790
Have you been well, ma'am?

763
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,220
Been well? Hardly.

764
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,490
How could I possibly be?

765
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,830
Ta-da!

766
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,400
What do you think? Pretty, right?

767
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,170
Looks real, doesn't it?

768
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,670
I might not be doing "well,"

769
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,380
but life is certainly absurd.

770
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,350
You are something else.
You really have a problem!

771
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,490
- Hey, you little brat!
- Gosh.

772
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,130
Why would you rip up
the discount coupon?

773
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,760
It was 20 percent off draft beer.

774
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,530
So much for the discount.
How are we supposed to use it now?

775
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,980
Please fill out
the Visitor Registration Application Form.

776
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,080
Visitor registration?

777
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,980
(Visitor application)

778
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,120
But I'm just going up for a second.

779
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,390
It won't take long to fill this out.

780
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,420
Okay.

781
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,060
(Ham Ji Woo, Room 3701,
Company colleague)

782
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,770
Here you go.

783
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,440
Please write down your
license plate number.

784
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,810
I took the subway.

785
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,080
Please wait a moment.

786
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,580
Yes. I'm calling
for visitor verification.

787
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,420
You're very kind.
I can just go by myself, you know.

788
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,320
The elevator is for residents only.
You need an access card.

789
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,790
I see.

790
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,100
I was told it was on the 37th floor.

791
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,100
Get an access card on the 20th floor
and then transfer elevators.

792
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,840
What? I have to make another stop?

793
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,670
(Visitor application)

794
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,940
You're missing the
license plate number.

795
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,040
Subway line nine.

796
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,810
I said I took subway line nine.

797
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,310
Very well.

798
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,070
I felt like I was going
through immigration.

799
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,240
Is this place Fort Knox
or something?

800
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Gosh.

801
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,440
- I guess it was worth the hassle.
- You really came.

802
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,880
I said we could meet outside,
but you had to come all this way.

803
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,620
Right.

804
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,520
Are you going to shower now?
Want some help?

805
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,760
How can you say something so forward
right to my face?

806
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,520
- Let me help you.
- No, I'm okay.

807
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,760
- But it must be uncomfortable.
- I said I'm fine.

808
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,290
- Come on, your arm...
- Ouch! That hurts!

809
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,000
Thank goodness.

810
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,910
Heavenly Father, thank you.
I'll live a good life from now on.

811
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,810
Please watch over me.

812
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,250
- What are you doing?
- What?

813
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:17,220
It's nothing.
I guess I was mistaken.

814
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,290
- This?
- It's Sungnyemun.

815
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,290
Excuse me?

816
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,760
What you were mistaken about.

817
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
National Treasure No. 1
is Sungnyemun.

818
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,100
It's not, "Claimed! Artistic genius,
National treasure, Smoking hot."

819
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,030
Wait, why is that on your arm?
Erase it.

820
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,930
- No, I don't want to.
- I said erase it now!

821
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,170
No way. I went to great lengths
to preserve this evidence.

822
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,810
What are you, a cop?
Why are you preserving evidence?

823
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,610
If I didn't keep it,
you'd act like you forgot, right?

824
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,480
Are you just trying to make me
look like a fool?

825
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,250
No, it's just...

826
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:50,520
Was I the only one who thought
that night was hot?

827
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,190
What are you talking about?

828
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,760
That night...

829
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,660
We were just drunk, that's all.

830
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,500
(Last night)

831
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,340
So?

832
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,240
If mixed, it could be the title song
for the second album.

833
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,250
Let's just eat the tuna.

834
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,050
Thank you.

835
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,990
What kind of reaction is that?

836
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,360
What do you mean?

837
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,990
You listened to the song.
At least say if it's good or bad.

838
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,030
This is my response.

839
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,630
Stuffing your face with tuna
is your response?

840
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,370
Do you really need
to live your life...

841
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,610
giving out autographs
to be framed on a wall?

842
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,680
You're coolest when buying me a meal
and signing the credit card slip.

843
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,410
That's my answer.

844
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,620
Ju Man.
Because you're mainly into metal,

845
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,060
folk rock just isn't your thing,
right?

846
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,160
- Are you some kind of masochist?
- What?

847
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,100
This isn't your first attempt.
You failed spectacularly.

848
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,430
Why so desperate to do music?
Do you enjoy failing or something?

849
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,840
Does getting hurt give you
some kind of thrill?

850
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,400
Look...

851
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,110
There are people who still remember
and love my music.

852
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,180
Hey, with fans like that,
even if I get hurt again,

853
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,980
don't you think it's worth
giving it another shot?

854
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,780
Ji Woo,

855
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,090
Okay, repeat after me.

856
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,590
What?

857
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,490
A free cruise? Not interested.
A timeshare? I'll pass.

858
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,660
- What are you saying?
- What does that even...

859
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,900
So what, you think that person
was trying to sell me something?

860
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,070
Or maybe they're trying
to save your soul.

861
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,610
- I'm just...
- As your friend,

862
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,680
I'm only saying this because
I don't want to lose you.

863
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,950
Just keep music as a hobby.

864
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,820
Chef. Can we get another plate
of fatty belly tuna, please?

865
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,130
(Mom)

866
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,000
Yes, hello?

867
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,740
Sorry, I was working earlier.

868
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,370
No, I wasn't avoiding your call.

869
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,240
What? A blind date?

870
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,350
What blind date? I'm not going.

871
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,380
I won't meet
a pharma CEO's daughter.

872
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,980
No, I really don't want to.
I mean it, I don't.

873
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,890
Wait, if you're going to cut me off,
why did you even call?

874
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
Mom,

875
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:46,030
I'm quitting my job at year's end.

876
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,230
I worked there long enough, right?

877
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,030
I'm...

878
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,300
I'm going to start
making music again.

879
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,100
I'm going to take this chance
to go all-in on my music.

880
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,370
Or so I'd say.

881
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,210
What's the point of saying all that
to a dead line?

882
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,580
(Karaoke)

883
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,420
(Koon Karaoke)

884
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,800
(I'm happy today.)

885
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,830
(Because you're here,
I'm happy today.)

886
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,580
(Because you're here,
I'm happy today.)

887
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:48,390
(My empty heart is
now full of stars)

888
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,400
<i>Every step I took chasing my dreams</i>

889
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:07,370
<i>The voices of everyone around me</i>

890
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,810
<i>Please shine a little light on me</i>

891
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,150
<i>Like magic</i>

892
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:19,050
<i>Make this wish come true</i>

893
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,760
<i>What a beautiful day</i>

894
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:28,360
<i>Even the sun and the moon</i>
<i>are on my side</i>

895
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,960
<i>Shining just for me</i>

896
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,840
<i>- Oh, please love me</i>
<i>- Oh, please love me</i>

897
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,910
<i>- In my empty heart</i>
<i>- In my empty heart</i>

898
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,410
<i>- It's full of stars</i>
<i>- It's full of stars</i>

899
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,180
<i>- Every moment felt like fate</i>
<i>- Every moment felt like fate</i>

900
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,520
<i>- I wanted to believe</i>
<i>- I wanted to believe</i>

901
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,990
<i>That someday</i>

902
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,430
<i>- My day would come</i>
<i>- My day would come</i>

903
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,330
<i>Be my miracle</i>

904
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,270
<i>- What a beautiful day</i>
<i>- What a beautiful day</i>

905
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,710
<i>Even the sun and the moon</i>
<i>are on my side</i>

906
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,510
<i>Shining just for me</i>

907
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:23,180
<i>- Oh, come and save me</i>
<i>- Oh, come and save me</i>

908
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,750
<i>- In my empty heart</i>
<i>- In my empty heart</i>

909
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,660
<i>- It's full of stars</i>
<i>- It's full of stars</i>

910
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,080
No way.

911
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:54,210
No way. Someone knows my song.

912
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,520
I mean, how could they know my song?

913
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,550
Maybe I'll just see who it is.

914
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,920
Yes, I'll just take a look.

915
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,870
Excuse me.
I'm from the room next door.

916
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:16,870
What?

917
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,010
I'm sorry about the other day.

918
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,350
I tend to have a bit
of a short fuse.

919
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,990
Well, I wasn't exactly
blameless either.

920
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,860
That was no way to treat a fan.

921
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:37,790
A fan?

922
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,860
You're my fan, aren't you,
Jung Da Hae?

923
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,100
Well, it's not so much that
I'm your fan, Dr. Ham.

924
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,240
You see, when I was little,

925
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,710
I was on this show called
"Echo of Love."

926
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,850
My family had completely
lost everything.

927
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,850
And at the time,

928
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,350
after the segment about
my family's story aired,

929
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,790
you sang a song, Dr. Ham.
Do you remember that?

930
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,330
- That performance?
- It was a total train wreck, right?

931
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,930
It wasn't a train wreck.
I was just extremely nervous.

932
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,270
I went on after TVXQ.
That must've been it.

933
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,280
All their fangirls were
so cold to me then.

934
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,610
- I liked it.
- You did? Really?

935
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:38,520
I was eighteen at the time.

936
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,990
Having to show my face on TV
because my family went broke...

937
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,490
Honestly,
it was just so humiliating.

938
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,600
Sure, they blurred out my face,

939
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,060
but still...

940
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,870
I was so worried
someone might recognize me.

941
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,110
I really felt like my life was over.

942
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:00,810
But that day,

943
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,480
I felt better
after seeing you, Dr. Ham.

944
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,550
It was like,

945
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,420
"I guess I'm not the only one
embarrassing myself up here."

946
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,360
"That guy up there must feel
the exact same way."

947
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,060
Like a sense of camaraderie,
you know?

948
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,390
Ever since then,

949
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,000
my family went under two more times.

950
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,830
And each time, I'd listen
to your song to get through it.

951
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,870
Like when I was studying
to retake my entrance exams,

952
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,280
and when I broke up
with my first boyfriend.

953
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,680
And...

954
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,680
the song kind of grew on me.

955
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,350
It's kind of dorky
but heartwarming, you know?

956
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,100
- If that offended you, I'm sorry...
- I love it.

957
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
What?

958
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,740
It's just been so long
since I've gotten a compliment like that.

959
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:06,810
It just makes me so happy.

960
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,520
Goodness.
What's wrong with your eyes?

961
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,520
- Oh my.
- The fact that my music...

962
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,220
actually saved someone...

963
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:25,860
makes me so incredibly happy.

964
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,290
Saved?

965
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,430
That's a little cheesy...

966
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,600
I know, but I'm just so
unbelievably happy...

967
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,840
Even so, I shouldn't make
a mistake like this,

968
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,110
should I?

969
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,390
You can.

970
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,960
It's okay to make that mistake.

971
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,070
By any chance,

972
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,570
if you're trying to sell me
a miracle mattress...

973
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,210
What?

974
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,710
Fine, I'll buy one.

975
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,650
For the record, I did nothing wrong
in this whole mess.

976
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,220
The news backs me up.
This injury from saving you...

977
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,790
You did that interview by yourself
while I was getting it treated.

978
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,590
I rushed over as soon as I was done,
but you just ignored my calls.

979
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,430
- You weren't avoiding me, were you?
- No, of course not...

980
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,340
Looks like you're about
to hammer in a nail.

981
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,380
What?

982
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,480
Oh, yes.

983
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,080
A picture frame fell.

984
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,220
This is what I mean.

985
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,660
- What do you mean?
- You, Dr. Ham,

986
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:41,360
are a "have" who can put a nail
in your wall whenever you want.

987
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,130
But I'm...

988
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,130
a "have-not" who'd be in big trouble
for putting a nail in my wall.

989
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,470
So, please, just think about it.

990
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,110
If people find out
that a girl like me,

991
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,110
a girl with no money
and no connections,

992
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,880
slept with you,
what do you think people will say?

993
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,080
I'd be lucky if they don't call me
a gold digger.

994
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,250
I doubt they'd say that.

995
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,850
Hey, you never know.

996
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,420
Right.

997
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,790
If I showed any interest, Dr. Ham,
other people would just see it...

998
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,190
as me being greedy. That's it.

999
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,130
So...

1000
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,470
let's just call that night
a mistake.

1001
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:22,940
It's for the best.

1002
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:45,790
Just so you know,

1003
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,230
if you're ever walking
down the street...

1004
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:52,070
and a scary-looking woman
grabs you by the hair,

1005
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,000
just think to yourself,
"So, it's finally happening."

1006
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,740
What?

1007
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,870
My mother stopped by earlier.

1008
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,670
When I told her I was getting
back into music,

1009
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,810
she demanded to know who's to blame
and then she trashed the place.

1010
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,180
Wait, are you...

1011
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,350
Are you saying that's my fault?

1012
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,950
No. I'm saying I envy you.

1013
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,350
You have a mom who's always
on your side,

1014
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,220
and the guts to do this
to your boss's arm.

1015
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,290
That's pretty cool.

1016
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:20,390
- Hey, about that...
- Jung Da Hae.

1017
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,260
You have more than I do.

1018
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,060
So...

1019
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,330
don't avoid me.

1020
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,650
I keep wanting more.

1021
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,080
I want to be rich.

1022
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,490
When I'm rich,

1023
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,960
I want to have better, nicer things
than I do now.

1024
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,390
And...

1025
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:53,990
I want to feel like I'm worthy
of enjoying all of it.

1026
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,430
(Ham Ji Woo)

1027
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:58,100
I want to be greedy
without holding back.

1028
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,940

00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:14,710
(Buy)

1031
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,520
(Confirm buy order)

1032
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,420
(Order placed)

1033
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,890
I don't want to stop anymore.

1034
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,300
Let's get started.

1035
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:39,710
But licking the lid is
just pure instinct.

1036
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:41,570
Okay, you got it?

1037
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,610
Whoever holds out the longest wins.

1038
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,140
The loser pays for karaoke.

1039
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,180
Alright, on your marks.

1040
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,780
And go!

1041
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,990
Alright.

1042
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,960
Anyway, are you really not going
to tell us?

1043
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:04,260
- Tell you what?
- That huge mistake of yours.

1044
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:08,400
I mean, two consenting adults
hooked up,

1045
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,700
so why is that such a big secret?

1046
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,840
I know, right?

1047
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:16,210
I came clean about my mom in a cult
and my dad becoming a deadbeat monk.

1048
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,580
You should just pick something
to believe in.

1049
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,510
There are plenty of things
to worship.

1050
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:25,220
- Queen B, The Rock, or chicken...
- Dr. Ham.

1051
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,890
Hey, where did Dr. Ham come from?

1052
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,020
Dr. Ham?

1053
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,060
You sleep with Dr. Ham?

1054
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,190
Seriously? For real?

1055
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,560
No way. How could you...

1056
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,230
How did that even happen?

1057
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,530
- Were you drunk?
- Yes.

1058
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,510
I almost came to my senses
in the middle of it.

1059
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,210
Gosh, but of all things,
it had to be those veins on his arm.

1060
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:51,840
So what's going to happen now?

1061
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,120
What do you mean?

1062
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,920
I mean, what's the next chapter
for you two?

1063
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:04,990
Like, is his mom going to show up,
throw an envelope of cash at you,

1064
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,630
and splash water in your face
demanding you break up?

1065
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,830
Or is it going to be his first love
who's in Paris right now...

1066
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,470
about to make a grand return
to Korea?

1067
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,770
A 5 feet 6 inches, 48kg girl
with long, straight hair...

1068
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:22,240
Is Dr. Ham's first love
going to show up?

1069
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:25,610
Hey, is this first love supposed
to be Jun Ji Hyun or something?

1070
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,250
- She's so wrecked.
- No, I'm not.

1071
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,990
I'll have a little chat with this
Jun Ji Hyun and we'll sort it out.

1072
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,820
What's with this go-getter attitude?

1073
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,030
You're not even talking about
giving up.

1074
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:43,030
- Is it love?
- Oh, you're in love?

1075
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:44,900
It's not like that.

1076
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,230
I...

1077
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,040
- I put ten grand into crypto.
- What?

1078
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,100
What?

1079
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:53,740
I maxed out my line of credit.

1080
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,410
I'm going all in.

1081
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,410
Once I'm rich,

1082
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,450
I'll hammer nails in my own walls...

1083
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,450
and take my mom to Mount Geumgang.

1084
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,720
I'll go as far as my money takes me
without ever stopping.

1085
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,220
And if I do all that,

1086
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,690
then even someone like Dr. Ham
won't be out of my reach.

1087
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,730
You never know.

1088
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,100
You know, no wonder.

1089
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,700
You just seemed larger
than life today.

1090
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,670
It's because you made
this huge decision.

1091
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,470
Aren't you just bloated?
Looks like you gained some weight.

1092
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,710
Ji Song, want to take
a walk with me?

1093
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,280
That streetlight seems
like a good spot for a beating.

1094
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,320
I'm going to a karaoke bar.

1095
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,550
Busted! Yes, karaoke!

1096
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,790
Darn it.

1097
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:44,420
Hey, Eun Sang is licking hers too.

1098
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,960
Oh, she's been doing that for ages.

1099
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,400
Oh, right.
Yes, you licked yours earlier.

1100
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,170
What?

1101
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,400
When did I lick this?

1102
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,140
You've still got a long way to go.

1103
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,870
We're too cheap to win the jackpot.

1104
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,970
No way.

1105
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,540
I'm telling you, we're not ready.

1106
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,140
Look at this!

1107
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,050
What?

1108
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,210
(Congratulations!
You've won a free one.)

1109
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:09,320
- Jackpot.
- Jackpot.

1110
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,630
No way! I can't believe this!

1111
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,570
Bringing a breath of fresh air
to the 2004 music scene.

1112
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:33,910
Please welcome amateur singer
Ham Ji Woo.

1117
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:50,590
<i>In a corner of the dawn sky</i>

1118
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:56,500
<i>Another star appears</i>
<i>in the weeping woods</i>

1119
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,440
<i>In the blink of an eye,</i>

1120
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,170

<i>Oh, please love me</i>

(Da Hae breathes
another heavy sigh today.)

1128
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,820
That was the rookie singer
Ham Ji Woo's...

1129
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,090
performance.

1130
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,850
Yes, well...

1131
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,190
for our plucky girl...

1132
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,260
- chasing her dreams,
- Yes.

1133
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:04,900
- Please support Da Hae and family.
- That's right.

1134
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,610
Hey, guys! You're here?

1135
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:17,480
- You saw "Echo of Love" yesterday?
- Of course!

1136
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,940
- You did?
- It was wild.

1137
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,410
But wasn't it super lame?

1138
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,280
A little? Yes, it totally was.

1139
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:24,520
- Totally cringey!
- What? Cringey?

1140
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,290
Like,
"tears welling up in my eyes" bad.

1141
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,790
How can he show his face after that?

1142
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,560
Wasn't that voice crack insane?

1143
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,090
- Tell me about it.
- I feel so bad for them.

1144
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,460
- I know.
- I'd be too embarrassed to show it.

1145
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,430
- I can't even watch it.
- Gosh, seriously.

1146
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:39,600
What are they going to do?

1147
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,600
- What's first period today?
- Oh, Math.

1148
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,370
Did you do the homework?

1149
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,440
- Of course not.
- Nope.

1152
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,040
Are you quitting?

1153
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:26,010
I don't expect anything from those
who didn't even add me to the chat.

1154
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,680
I'll add you, Ji Song.

1155
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,380
She's walking on eggshells.

1156
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,920
She knows she's an outcast.

1157
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,950
Our team?

1158
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,850
Why are you so serious
about company dinners?

1159
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,960
So what should I do if I want
to have a fling with someone?

1160
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:37,460
Don't you have your eye on Dr. Ham?

1161
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,490
I heard there was a party tomorrow.

1162
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,930
It's the perfect day
for a total transformation.

1163
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,500
Dr. Ham will also be at Table One.

1164
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,870
Who should be the star
of this very seat?

1165
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,100
I'm going to sit next to Dr. Ham
at tomorrow's event.

1166
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,170
Promise me you'll sit next to me.

1167
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,440
What are you doing?
Why did you remove my name?
