1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,210
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,570
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,810
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,280
Is this for real?

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,610
We made it all the way here
through all that ice...

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,980
just to miss the last train.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,120
Are you kidding me?

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,190
A cab will show up soon.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,760
I said we should've just walked.

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,020
Are you crazy? It's minus 20°C.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,730
You two need to save money.

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,190
It's the money you waste...

13
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,730
on taxis and deliveries
that's the real killer.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,800
Who knows what the future holds?

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,370
How could you waste
your money like that?

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,900
And how is the world
going to change?

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,300
A decentralized...

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,240
world of finance!

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,510
(Fun finance in a contactless world)

20
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,580
Soon,
with just a single virtual wallet,

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,480
you will be able to make
transactions freely...

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,910
anywhere you want.

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,220
Everyone will be desperate
to have digital assets.

24
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,050
And you still don't want to invest?

25
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,320
- Do you want to be left behind?
- Eun Sang.

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,350
(What remains after gambling
is social isolation.)

27
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,920
You're the one who's going
to be left behind.

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,330
This isn't gambling!

29
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,630
So that's what you meant
by "one big score."

30
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,370
Look, whatever you want to call it,
let's not pursue a lost cause.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,500
If we're not going
to just quit here,

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,640
we have to at least protect
what little we have.

33
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,440
What do you even have to protect?

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,580
- What?
- What?

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,750
You said to protect what you have.
So what is it you actually have?

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,780
Youth? Beauty?

37
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,220
Our brilliant minds?

38
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,550
Our great skin?

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,960
I... I have my savings account,

40
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,000
- and diligence!
- Okay.

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,870
My integrity and hard work.

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I have my own assets, you know.
Like my work ethic.

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,410
- Wipe your tears before you talk.
- I'm not crying.

44
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,180
I mean, seriously, what are you two
going to do? What's your plan?

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,280
Fine, then. Just tell me.

46
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,220
What?

47
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,050
That...

48
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,020
That crypto thing...
How does it work?

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,130
Okay, so here's the thing.

50
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,330
(Episode 2:
Between Diligence and Inferiority)

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Watermelon.

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,870
Applause.

53
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,910
Towel.

54
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,410
Health.

55
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,610
Puppy.

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,580
Puppy? Wait...

57
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,780
- Map?
- City.

58
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,990
What could come after city?

59
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,660
I can't think of a word.

60
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,160
- Just give me a second.
- Hurry, come up with a word.

61
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,430
City...

62
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,140
- I don't want to!
- What?

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,770
You're going to leave.

64
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,170
It's your first time in my dream,

65
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,110
and if we finish this game,

66
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,480
you're just going to leave,
aren't you?

67
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,880
Don't go.

68
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,120
I told you,
Mommy can't think of one yet.

69
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
After city...

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,320
City...

71
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,330
Right, a word that can come after...

72
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,330
Gosh.
Clock, market, stream, seed money.

73
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,830
- See? There are plenty.
- What was that last one?

74
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,230
This is no time for crying.

75
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,970
Did you scrape up the seed money?

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,270
Your entry timing wasn't bad.

77
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,410
What about your friends?
Aren't they in yet?

78
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,210
You need to get on the crypto train
while it's at a low.

79
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,880
What are you talking about?

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,250
When you're buying,

81
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,860
timing is everything.

82
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,660
Once it hits a high point,

83
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,560
I'll freeze everything for you.
Don't worry about it.

84
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,100
Go on, hurry.
This is where it really begins.

85
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,320
And now for our next story.
With financial markets struggling,

86
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,390
cryptocurrency is gaining attention
as an alternative investment.

87
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,960
The KOSPI and the won-dollar rate
have fallen in tandem,

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,830
and the KOSPI has been fluctuating
around the 2,400-point mark,

89
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,170
remaining stuck in a frustratingly
narrow trading range.

90
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,110
In this climate, some cryptos,
including Enderium,

91
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,380
are fueling anticipation
for a fresh start.

92
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,610
The hope is that this signals
a change in the stagnant market.

93
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,950
It's the start.

94
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,620
And now for sports.

95
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Lee Sang Hwa at
the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games...

96
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,710
Get up, get up.
Didn't I tell you to fix this door?

97
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,440
How could you leave
the door like that...

98
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,810
and possibly sleep with no worries?

99
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,410
Okay, that hurts.
Why are you making a fuss so early?

100
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,990
Darn it, I'm late. I'm so late.
Just a second.

101
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,850
For crying out loud.

102
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,630
My goodness.

103
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,360
This place is a pigsty.

104
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,870
Let's calm down.

105
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,770
I have to be patient.

106
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,800
She is not some wild animal.

107
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,440
I fed her three square meals a day,

108
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,740
and I put her through school.
She's my daughter.

109
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,180
What are you, a crow?

110
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,550
You were in there for two seconds,
and you're already out?

111
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,190
The bathroom has
no proper threshold.

112
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,350
If I shower too long, it floods.

113
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,160
Why don't you ever clean up?

114
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,330
The front door has no threshold.

115
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,260
Dust from outside blows right in.

116
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,230
Did you forget how a trash works?

117
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,900
Why do you just show up unannounced
and start nagging me?

118
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,170
I won't be long.

119
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,640
I just stopped by on my way
to my doctor's appointment.

120
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,280
- A doctor's appointment?
- Gosh.

121
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,710
For your back?

122
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,180
Gosh.

123
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,220
Stop just getting painkiller shots
and get some real treatment.

124
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,720
Are you ever going to get married?

125
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,120
Where did that come from?

126
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,190
Mom, why does every talk with you
always have to end with marriage?

127
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,730
You should hurry up and get married
before Byeong Jun sees how you live.

128
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,400
Lock him down and marry him already.

129
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,530
Mom...

130
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,840
Mom, do we have a secret inheritance
I don't know about?

131
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,210
What?

132
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,110
Or that old chamber pot
in the family storage shed.

133
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,480
Is it an antique
that can make us rich?

134
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,980
Was I the only one who didn't know?

135
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,150
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,950
You need money to get married.

137
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,620
Who would marry me
when I have no money or anything?

138
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,090
Did he dump you?

139
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
She got dumped.

140
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,400
That good-for-nothing jerk.

141
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,070
How dare he dump my daughter?

142
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,940
There's nothing wrong with my baby!

143
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,340
Money. I'm short on money.

144
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
That jerk...

145
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,460
Eat something before you go.

146
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,390
It was your birthday, after all.
You should have some seaweed soup.

147
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,070
But still, don't you dare
end up like your father.

148
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,570
Even if you're not the best,
you just have to work hard in life.

149
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,670
Got it?

150
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,210
Your dad has an incurable disease.

151
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,880
He'll never be cured of it,
not in a million years.

152
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,050
My dad had an illness.

153
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,480
"Jackpot fever."

154
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,820
That's it.

155
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,890
I'll raise cattle.

156
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,590
With no job and nothing to his name,
my dad was obsessed with business.

157
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,430
Always dreaming of
hitting the jackpot.

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,600
One day,

159
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,900
he declared he was going
to raise cows.

160
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,800
Here's what he said.

161
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,140
"Produce grown
while listening to classical music..."

162
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,640
"sold for big money."

163
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,010
"That's why
I'm going to raise cattle..."

164
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,410
"that grew up listening to K-pop."

165
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,810
He said fans would line up for beef
raised on their idol's music.

166
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,420
- But then...
- No way.

167
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,350
- Unbelievable!
- After their idol's drug arrest,

168
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,690
they questioned the cattle's sanity
that had been raised on his music,

169
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,130
which sparked a boycott...

170
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,500
of all products
he was associated with.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
The business failed spectacularly.

172
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,800
But my dad didn't stop there.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,240
That's it. We're going to space.

174
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,440
After learning a relative worked
at China's National Space Base,

175
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,250
he was once again swept up
in a new dream.

176
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,410
He was going to build campers...

177
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,080
made out of
exterior materials for rockets.

178
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,090
But then...

179
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,220
No way! Unbelievable

180
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,490
But when the rocket was shown live
exploding seconds after launch,

181
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,800
the business went under once again.

182
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,170
I'll be back when I've made it.

183
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,240
(From Dad)

184
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,010
Where's Jung Yong Jik?

185
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,710
- Where is he?
- Wait a minute.

186
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,680
What will you do about this?

187
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,980
My dad kept failing
until there was nothing left to lose.

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,450
After my dad left home to chase
that darn dream of his,

189
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,390
- we struggled just to get by.
- Here's your beer.

190
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,060
- My beer?
- Yes, here's your beer.

191
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,390
Here you go.

192
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,760
- Yes, thank you.
- Be careful with that.

193
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,360
Hey, you tramp!

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,430
Back then,
I only had one thing on my mind.

195
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,740
I will never end up like my dad.

196
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,970
And I'd avoid get-rich-quick schemes
like crypto.

197
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,610
Just a second!

198
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,750
I made it.

199
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,320
Gosh, I still can't believe I bought it
when I was so against it.

200
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,060
- You crazy girl.
- Did you call for Maxbi?

201
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,260
Gosh, you scared me.

202
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,300
I wasn't calling you.

203
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,460
(Enderium)

204
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,570
I should just hurry up
and sell this thing.

205
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,040
(Are you sure you want to sell?
Confirm to sell.)

206
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,110
- Thanks, Dad!
- Okay, be home early tonight.

207
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,370
Okay, drive safe.

208
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,080
Da Hae!

209
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,020
Fancy meeting you here.

210
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,220
Good morning.

211
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,120
- A beautiful morning, isn't it?
- What?

212
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,690
A "beautiful" morning
on my way to work?

213
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,930
Not unless you got shot in the head.

214
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,800
I brought you a coffee.
This is for you.

215
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,100
- Thanks.
- Let's hurry inside.

216
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,880
- Stop the unfair layoffs!
- Stop them now!

217
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,610
- Protect our livelihoods!
- Protect them now!

218
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,280
- Guarantee our job security!
- Guarantee it now!

219
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,750
Ms. Round.

220
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,290
"Masijokko?"

221
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes.

222
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,360
To appeal to people of all ages,

223
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,860
our snack's name should be simple
and intuitive.

224
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,230
And to clearly emphasize that
it's a chicken-based snack,

225
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,040
"Masijokko."

226
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,470
What better name conveys
the meaning...

227
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,610
"A tasty chicken-flavored snack?"

228
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,310
Was that too over-the-top?

229
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,550
Isn't it a little plain?
There's intuitive, then uninspired.

230
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,650
I think we need to be more creative
and more artistic, don't you think?

231
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,190
I feel like there's something better
out there.

232
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,830
Don't just criticize.
Offer a solution, then.

233
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,800
Does anyone have any other
suggestions, then?

234
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,330
What if we make a small tweak?

235
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,930
- A tweak?
- Yes.

236
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,670
It's a pun in Korean,

237
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,470
so by changing one small particle,

238
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,570
it goes from just "tastes good,"

239
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,440
to implying "The taste is good,
and it lifts your spirits too."

240
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
It kills two birds with one stone.

241
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,150
- Just by changing one particle...
- I like it.

242
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,580
Yes, changing the particle...

243
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,720
makes it feel
so much fresher, right?

244
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,520
Yes.
It means more than "tastes good."

245
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,160
Da Hee, you've got great instincts.

246
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,190
Gosh, who's this genius
in our hiring class?

247
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,330
That would be the 14th rookie class.

248
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,770
The 14th! We're fast! Let's go!

249
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,870
Let's win!

250
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,930
(3 years ago)

251
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,670
- Yes.
- Yes!

252
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,670
- Go, 14th!
- Go, 14th!

253
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,570
(Welcome Employees
of Marron Confectionery!)

254
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,240
Da Hae, what are you doing
over there?

255
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,650
What hiring class were you in again?
Were you here before us?

256
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,650
The 12th? Or the 13th?

257
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,450
I'm...

258
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,220
I don't think I saw her
at orientation.

259
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,390
I'm sorry.
My foot's kind of bothering me.

260
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,460
I'm just going to go rest
over there.

261
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,490
- Yes.
- Okay.

262
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,070
Esteemed executives and employees,

263
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,700
on this beautiful autumn day,

264
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,040
it's a great pleasure to see
all of you gathered here together.

265
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,510
Excuse me. Is it okay if I sit here?

266
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,710
Oh, these seats are reserved
for our class.

267
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,310
A time to look back on the path
we have walked together...

268
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,880
Hey, this is my seat.

269
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,490
And to resolve to make new plans
for the future.

270
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,850
- What about here?
- Sorry.

271
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,020
Hey, you!
Why are you still standing?

272
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,160
Hurry up and sit down!

273
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,640
What's this?

274
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,770
She just created a chair
out of thin air.

275
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,140
A true master of creativity.

276
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,980
It's nothing special.
It's quite simple.

277
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,150
I just endured, and endured.
That is how I've persevered.

278
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,390
Enduring for three days straight.

279
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,890
Enduring until you feel you'll die.

280
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,460
Enduring until you're about to cry,

281
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,720
- What will she do?
- and enduring...

282
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,860
till your tears dry up.

283
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,800
You endure it and endure it...

284
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,800
That is how I've managed to endure.

285
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,510
That day,
sitting on that invisible chair,

286
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,810
I foresaw my own opaque future,

287
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,510
the miserable, wretched future
that awaits a private hire.

288
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,520
And for some reason,
bad feelings are never wrong.

289
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,450
All right, let's add today's names
to the list of candidates.

290
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,390
- Okay.
- Thanks for your hard work.

291
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,430
Da Hee and Ms. Round...

292
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,060
For the Children's Day proposals...

293
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,030
Both of your proposals
have been selected as finalists.

294
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,430
Oh my gosh, really?

295
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,240
If this goes well, it's a fast track
to Assistant Manager, right?

296
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,840
What? I've applied for
the last three years...

297
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,510
and have been rejected every time.
I actually got picked?

298
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,710
I pushed for you two.

299
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,740
A chance like this has come my way?

300
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,450
Is this for real?

301
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,080
Ms. Round? Why are you so quiet?

302
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,450
Are you happy about this or what?

303
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,150
Ms. Round?

304
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,490
Well...

305
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,320
- Jackpot!
- It's a jackpot, right?

306
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,890
All right, let's wrap this up.

307
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,630
Great work, everyone.

308
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,900
Mr. Ko!

309
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,600
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

310
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,700
I guess it's true
that every dog has its day.

311
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,170
All right. Let's do this!

312
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,810
Promotion for Jung Da Hae.
Let's get it!

313
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,650
- Ji Song.
- Yes?

314
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,590
- Can you grab my copies for me?
- Okay.

315
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,660
- Hey, Ji Song?
- Yes!

316
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,030
Can you take this
to the Sales Department?

317
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,390
- Sure.
- Ji Song?

318
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,490
- Yes?
- Can you prep...

319
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,500
- the conference room?
- Sure.

320
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,760
- Ji Song, can you get me a coffee?
- Sure.

321
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,270
- (- Those are so pretty.
- Whose are they? DM me.)

322
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,410
(Wei Lin)

323
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,840
Your shoes are pretty,
and you are too, honey.

324
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,420
This is why I love
buying new things.

325
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,950
Looks like you bought new shoes,
Ji Song.

326
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,420
I did! Aren't they pretty?

327
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,550
Yes.

328
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,360
- But can you even work in those?
- Excuse me?

329
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,330
I know I wouldn't be able to
get any work done in those.

330
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,670
Then again, not that you do much
around here anyway.

331
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
What do you mean?

332
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,170
I have plenty of receipts
I have to paste for expenses.

333
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,910
And they're comfier than they look.

334
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,280
Right, but don't you get anxious...

335
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,680
just doing menial work like that?

336
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,350
Even I worry, and I'm a full-timer.

337
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,480
You must have so much on your mind.

338
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,760
You know,

339
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,530
maybe that's why
I don't look my age.

340
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,430
Because I don't worry.

341
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
What?

342
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,530
Well...

343
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,070
Worrying causes wrinkles, right?

344
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,440
One day, like you,
Assistant Manager Jo,

345
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,540
the time will come
when I'll have to start worrying.

346
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,840
Gosh, just thinking about it
is terrifying.

347
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,550
And what exactly am I supposed
to be worried about?

348
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,450
Your wrinkles.

349
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,720
Isn't that what
you were referring to?

350
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,620
Goodness.

351
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,060
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I assumed that's what you meant...

352
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,400
That's not it at all.

353
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,960
I'm so sorry.

354
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,970
- I'm so sorry.
- That girl...

355
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,040
Do I have wrinkles? Are they bad?

356
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Take a look.

357
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,410
Oh my gosh!

358
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,880
Ms. Eun Sang,
you can't go in that stall.

359
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,280
What in the world!

360
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,380
It's been like that since yesterday.

361
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,820
Seriously, I thought a cow used it.

362
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,620
But why would they just
leave it like that?

363
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,750
The cleaning staff is on strike,
remember?

364
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,620
Plus, that's not a cleaning job.
It needs to be unclogged.

365
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,860
I totally lost my appetite.

366
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,230
I've not eaten
since lunch yesterday.

367
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,000
Same here.
I can't even think about food.

368
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,070
It's just awful.

369
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,240
Ms. Eun Sang, what are you doing?

370
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,340
Hey, don't do it, Ms. Eun Sang.

371
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,840
- What are you thinking?
- Don't!

372
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,680
What do we have besides our lunch?

373
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,450
I won't let this clog ruin it.

374
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,950
- Ms. Eun Sang!
- Ms. Eun Sang!

375
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,850
Whatever you hear, don't panic.
Just stay back.

376
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,120
- Goodness.
- Okay.

377
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,830
What in the... Oh, gosh!

378
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,570
- Go down! Just go down!
- Ms. Eun Sang!

379
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,630
Go down!

380
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,300
- Is it overflowing?
- Ms. Eun Sang, are you okay?

381
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,770
- Are you okay?
- Stay back! Oh, darn it!

382
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,750
Go ahead and take care of business.

383
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,050
Oh my gosh, what would we have done
without you, Eun Sang?

384
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,690
- Seriously.
- You're the best! The best!

385
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,890
The best!

386
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Oh, when did you guys get here?

387
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,190
You're something else.
How did you even unclog that thing?

388
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,660
I'm so nauseous.

389
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,100
I'm about to throw up my formula.

390
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,230
Come on, you're all being dramatic.
Let's just go eat.

391
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
How can you even think
about food right now?

392
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm buying.

393
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,110
Make way.
The one who pays is coming through.

394
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,410
Yes!

395
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,510
Clear the way.

396
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,190
Let's eat!

397
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,360
- Thanks for the meal!
- Thanks for the meal!

398
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,930
What's gotten into you?

399
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,360
Our penny-pincher is
paying the bill.

400
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,570
Oh, come on, it's no big deal.

401
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,300
Whose foot is that?

402
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,800
- Whose foot is on my lap?
- What?

403
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,140
Oh, sorry.
I was just trying to stretch.

404
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,110
Seriously...

405
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,280
My feet are killing me.
My new shoes aren't broken in yet.

406
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,580
New shoes? You bought new shoes?

407
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,590
The FW limited-edition collection.

408
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,460
They're pretty.

409
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,190
Hey, how much?

410
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,100
Isn't it weird?
Why do new things drop on rent day?

411
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,800
You're saying they cost
a month's rent?

412
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,430
That's a ridiculous price
for someone in your situation.

413
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,200
Look,
if I actually lived within my means,

414
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,840
I'd be homeless at Seoul Station
with some guy named Mr. Kim

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,610
and living off free meals
at a church.

416
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,540
Then go live like that,
you little brat.

417
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,680
I can't.
I went to a Buddhist kindergarten.

418
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,080
Hey.
If you don't want it to be a luxury,

419
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,520
do you know what you have to do?

420
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,120
- What?
- How?

421
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,230
You have to make more money.

422
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,130
Exactly. How do I make more money?

423
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,430
Not this again.

424
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,330
Yes. We're talking about
crypto again.

425
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,210
You seemed so ready to jump in.
So, what happened?

426
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,870
Oh, me? Well...

427
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,980
Hey!

428
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,640
You really think Da Hae is like you?

429
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,280
She wouldn't fall for instant wealth
and invest in crypto.

430
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,580
Right, Da Hae?

431
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,620
Yes, well... Right.

432
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,550
I am a bit more susceptible.

433
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,490
- Yes.
- I'd be crazy

434
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,530
if I weren't profiting. But I am.

435
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,330
This is how I'm able to treat you.

436
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,360
Now, gather around.

437
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,670
Have you guys ever heard
of something called a J-Curve?

438
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,840
- A J-Curve?
- Even when it's in total freefall,

439
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,450
it eventually hits an upward curve.
That's what a J-Curve is.

440
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,280
It's sort of a pattern.
And right now, the trend is...

441
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,350
just like this.

442
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,550
So it's like a diet, right?

443
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,990
You might think you hit a plateau,

444
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,960
but if you stick to your diet
and exercise,

445
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,030
you'll eventually lose weight,
right?

446
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,660
Exactly.

447
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,000
See? Just look.

448
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,370
- We can make money.
- That's the J?

449
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,270
(Enderium)

450
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,910
- But it's plummeting.
- What?

451
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,410
Oh!

452
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,640
You know what this means?

453
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,050
It means it's hit rock bottom,
and now the only way to go is up.

454
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,520
A true J.

455
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,520
- Oh, give me a break.
- What?

456
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,360
E Rin, what are you up to?

457
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,760
Ji Song, you get it, right?
Ji Song! Kim Ji Song.

458
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,090
Hey, you get it, right?

459
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,930
When is it supposed to become a J?

460
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,770
No, forget it.

461
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,170
I don't have time for this.

462
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,870
I have to get back to work. Work.

463
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,680
- Da Hae, have you had lunch?
- Yes.

464
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,380
Looks like you're prepping
for the presentation.

465
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,150
By the way,
who's judging the PTs this time?

466
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,020
The executive directors and Dr. Ham.

467
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,520
Dr. Ham?

468
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,590
Oh, I love him.

469
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,790
What? Not even hiding it, are you?

470
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,920
I have a condition where I get giddy
just thinking about handsome men.

471
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,830
Excuse me, but who's Dr. Ham?

472
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,730
Oh, right. You're an intern,
Ye Jin, so you wouldn't know.

473
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,030
Let's just say...

474
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,100
he's our executive director
and a living legend.

475
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,510
You know Choco Cup, right?

476
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,150
It's our company's bestseller now,

477
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,150
but we were worried
before its launch.

478
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,690
Our first new product in years.
"How do we make sure it sells?"

479
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,860
Or, "How do we make it sell
even better?"

480
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,460
All the vice presidents
had intense, cutthroat meetings,

481
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,500
but they just weren't
getting anywhere.

482
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,870
- Wait!
- And right then,

483
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,670
Dr. Ham, who'd been silent
the whole time, said...

484
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,440
How about we draw a line?

485
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,070
Let's call it...

486
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,340
The Conscience Line.

487
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,250
In an age of deception and rip-offs,
you can't tell what's in the bag.

488
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,750
Where is that thing? Oh, here.

489
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,590
A line was drawn on the bag.
"We promise snacks up to this line."

490
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,630
- A.K.A. The Conscience Line.
- And that was Dr. Ham's idea?

491
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,800
Yes.

492
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,570
And this idea, as cool as Dr. Ham,

493
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,270
caused a huge sensation
as soon as it was released.

494
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,640
But what made this campaign
a massive hit was...

495
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,870
because of what happened recently.

496
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,940
Ladies and gentlemen.

497
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,950
Yes, her opponent under-rotated,
but no points were deducted.

498
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,950
This is a clear case
of biased judging.

499
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,450
- Yes.
- But then...

500
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,750
A doping scandal broke.

501
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,650
Oh, it's a gold medal!

502
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,020
A gold medal for South Korea!

503
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,460
Thanks to that, our silver medalist
rightfully won back the gold medal.

504
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,130
Are you all watching this?
Our conscience has triumphed.

505
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,730
At this point, you'd have to say
the universe is on Dr. Ham's side.

506
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,840
It's like he descended to Earth,
blessed with cosmic energy.

507
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,470
So...

508
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,950
So it's like a creation myth,
like he was hatched from an egg.

509
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,020
I'm just saying he's on that level.
He's an incredible guy.

510
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,490
But why do you call him "Doctor?"
Does he have a Ph.D.?

511
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,560
Well, that and other things.

512
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,460
Even when he was a regular employee,
he created so many hit products.

513
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,230
So the CEO started calling him,
"Gosh, our Dr. Ham..."

514
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,330
and doted on him like a grandson.

515
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,170
When he was promoted to Director,

516
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,170
he didn't want to be part of the
company's rigid hierarchy, and so...

517
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,980
the name "Doctor Ham" just stuck.

518
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,680
He really is an incredible guy.

519
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,980
But Da Hae,
didn't you say you met him...

520
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,150
during your job interview?

521
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,250
Yes.

522
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,450
I doubt he'd remember me, though.

523
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
I guess so.
You do have a pretty generic look.

524
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,360
Gosh, I didn't see that coming.
That one stung.

525
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,060
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

526
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,000
But still,
he does seem pretty incredible.

527
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,010
It sounds like he's untouchable.

528
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,690
It's time for the all-hands meeting.

529
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,930
(I want to clock out and lie down.
I want to sleep. I want to go home.)

530
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,200
You seem to be in a good mood.

531
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
- You've been humming all morning.
- I have?

532
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,570
You have.

533
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,010
I guess I have. That...

534
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,310
What song is stuck in my head?

535
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,410
<i>Absurdity!</i>

536
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,680
What's this?
Isn't this our inventory list?

537
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,990
- Is this from Assistant Manager Oh?
- Looks like it.

538
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,720
- Give Assistant Manager Oh a call.
- Okay.

539
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,500
He's not picking up.
He also left his laptop behind.

540
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,960
Where is Assistant Manager Oh?
Find him now.

541
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,400
He can't be far. I'll just...

542
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,370
Ji Song?

543
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,380
- Yes?
- Ji Song, you go after him.

544
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,850
Go on, you're wearing
comfortable shoes!

545
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,950
Me?

546
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,130
Assistant Manager Oh! Wait up!

547
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,990
Wait!

548
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,610
Excuse me. Coming through!
Sorry about that.

549
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,480
Okay, thanks. Assistant Manager Oh!

550
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Assistant Manager Oh!

551
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,620
Wait!

552
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,070
Darn it.

553
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,450
Assistant Manager Oh!

554
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,120
Wait!

555
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Assistant Manager Oh!

556
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,050
Wait!

557
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Assistant Manager Oh...

558
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,800
Ji Song!

559
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,600
- Here...
- What?

560
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,670
You left this...

561
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,410
Ji Song, did you follow me
all the way out here?

562
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,410
You...

563
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,910
One second.

564
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,950
Hello?

565
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
- Hello?
- Ji Song?

566
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,690
I just got off the phone with him.
He said the files were in his bag.

567
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,860
So you can come back to the office.

568
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,870
- Ji Song, are you all right?
- Yes.

569
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,600
On my way over here,

570
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,710
- I think I might've broken my toes.
- What?

571
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,680
Could you help me find them?

572
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,580
My shoes...

573
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,460
Who does she think she is,
acting up like that?

574
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,300
Why would you let someone
like her mess with you? Darn it.

575
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,410
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

576
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,720
Come on, stand up properly.

577
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,190
I can't put any weight on my toes.

578
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,250
Da Hae, please call a cab for me.

579
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,220
Your place is just around the corner.
We're not calling a cab.

580
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,860
I can't take another single step.

581
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,400
- You're so heavy!
- That hurts!

582
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,700
Hey!

583
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,730
- What?
- There, that's it.

584
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,780
Look at those old ladies.
That's hilarious!

585
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,920
You're totally lying about
that "one meal a day," aren't you?

586
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,950
It's more like
"one meat meal a day," right?

587
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,320
Save your breath.
It just makes this harder.

588
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,820
Drivers,
a little more gently, please.

589
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,430
The suspension on this thing
is terrible.

590
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,700
Excuse me, ma'am.
Will your life cover the fare?

591
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,030
No. This is a memory in the making,
so let's take a picture. Come on.

592
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,270
Okay! One, two, three! Smile!

593
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Just drop dead.

594
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,940
Will you snap out of it?
Want me to just dump you?

595
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,710
No! Why would you dump Ji Song?

596
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,780
You're the best! I'm so touched.

597
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,280
- She has to do crypto with us too.
- This is so freaking annoying.

598
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,250
Crypto this, crypto that.
Why don't you just do it yourself?

599
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,650
- Why keep pushing me into this?
- I can't do it alone.

600
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,160
- Why? Why can't you?
- Hey!

601
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
Oh, no. What do I do?

602
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,980
Eun Sang!
What did I do? I'm so sorry!

603
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,050
I'm so sorry!

604
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,720
Eun Sang!

605
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,880
Are you okay?

606
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,290
I can't bear to watch...

607
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,190
to see you two collapse.

608
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,090
If we keep on like this,

609
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,930
what other outcome can there be?

610
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,660
Nothing but ruin.

611
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,930
Is there any other story left
for us to write?

612
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,800
I see what's coming,
and I can't just ignore it.

613
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,970
I won't let that happen to you two!

614
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,510
Be careful. Please be careful.

615
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,880
Please, be careful.

616
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,020
- Eun Sang!
- Let's go.

617
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,160
(Marron Confectionery)

618
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,660
(Marron Confectionery
and Sahara Trading MOU Signing)

619
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,900
He looks forward to our partnership.

620
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,140
We look forward to working with you.

621
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,840
The pleasure is all ours.

622
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,940
- We will do our absolute best.
- Thank you.

623
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,280
Excuse me, just a moment.
Sir, one moment, please.

624
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,280
Mr. Cheon, our restaurant called.

625
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,620
Their refrigerator broke down,

626
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,750
and they're asking if we can
push our reservation back an hour.

627
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,720
What? What's the plan?
Find another restaurant nearby fast.

628
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,630
I'm trying, but they're Muslim.

629
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,960
A Halal restaurant
takes time to find.

630
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,600
A Korean BBQ place?

631
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,830
At a BBQ place, the exhaust hoods
make it hard to talk face-to-face.

632
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,840
What do we do now?

633
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,410
- I'm sorry, sir.
- What are we going to do?

634
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,070
So...

635
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
Right this way, please.

636
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,950
Is this the restaurant?

637
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,760
I'd like to offer you an appetizer.

638
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,430
- An appetizer?
- Yes.

639
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,800
Using Marron's products,

640
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,830
I'd like to create
a one-of-a-kind appetizer...

641
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,330
exclusively for you.

642
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,980
With Marron's products?

643
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,250
You mean with snacks?
Is that possible?

644
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,820
We certainly can.

645
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,920
First, we have one of
Marron's most popular products,

646
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,790
the Milk Tarte.

647
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
(Milk Tarte)

648
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,860
On top, we'll add some peach jam
that was launched this year.

649
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,500
Then, just pop it in the microwave
for exactly 40 seconds...

650
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,710
Voila, the Milk Tarte Peach Tart
is complete.

651
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,750
This ice bar, the Kkeukkeuryu Bar,

652
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,550
sold over 100,000 on its first day.

653
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,390
(Kkeukkeuryu bar)

654
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Open it and drop it into a glass
of sparkling water full of ice.

655
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,840
And there you have
a tasty non-alcoholic cocktail...

656
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,000
you can even enjoy at the office.

657
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,180
He says it's quite delicious.

658
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,790
- Delicious, he says.
- And isn't it charming?

659
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,690
And now, for the grand finale.

660
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,690
To our cookies-and-cream ice cream,
we'll add Marron's Ppeppe Stick,

661
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,590
our Bincheu Bencheu,

662
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,500
and our soon-to-be-released
secret weapon!

663
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,770
- Our Chocolate Marshmallow...
- Stop!

664
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,080
Don't marshmallows use pork gelatin?

665
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,780
Our client doesn't eat pork.

666
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,850
Now what do we do?

667
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:43,500
At Marron Confectionery,
we use Halal-certified beef gelatin.

668
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,980
We should head to the restaurant.
It's all ready for us. Shall we?

669
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,120
- Lunch time.
- Right this way.

670
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,420
Yes, right this way. Ms. Eun Sang.

671
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,530
- Peace be upon you.
- My brother!

672
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,600
- Eun Sang, you did a great job.
- Thanks.

673
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,210
The buyer was singing your praises.

674
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,540
He's planning on visiting
again next year,

675
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,450
and he asked if
you'd still be here then.

676
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,010
Well, of course...

677
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,390
- Actually, no.
- What?

678
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,790
I'm not even sure about tomorrow,
so how can I promise next year?

679
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,030
So you might be leaving?

680
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,930
That's a shame.

681
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,100
The company needs someone like you.

682
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,130
I don't know about that.

683
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,070
Everyone's replaceable.

684
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:01,040
- Protect our livelihoods!
- Protect them now!

685
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,880
- Guarantee our job security!
- Guarantee it now!

686
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,280
- Ms. Eun Sang, you should go.
- Some other time.

687
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,080
Right.

688
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,820
If you do end up leaving,
do you have any other plans?

689
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,390
- To the moon.
- I'm sorry?

690
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,590
That's where I'm going.

691
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,090
Where?

692
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,230
Up there.

693
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,860
All the way to the moon.

694
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,570
Let's do this!

695
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,340
Let's nail this Children's Day,
the retail industry's high season!

696
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,050
Marron's bestselling Choco Cup,
and the kids' hero, Yongki.

697
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,580
Yongki, the beloved character,
and our Choco Cup have teamed up.

698
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,150
Darn it.

699
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,760
Featuring his signature white pearls
and a touch of white chocolate.

700
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,500
It's the Yongki Special Edition.

701
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,930
Plus a special edition.

702
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Children's Day...

703
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,000
Excuse me.

704
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,770
(Children's Day Promotion Proposal)

705
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,180
Da Hee, what are you doing here?

706
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,050
Didn't you already clock out?

707
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:15,020
I forgot my umbrella.
Preparing for the presentation?

708
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,450
Yes. Just a little.

709
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,120
Perfect timing.

710
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,890
I brought some coffee
for everyone working late.

711
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,290
Here, this one's for you, Da Hae.

712
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,930
Thank you.

713
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,070
Of course.
Good luck with your presentation.

714
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,130
You got this!

715
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
But wait.

716
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,680
You sound
as if you're not working on it too.

717
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,250
Of course,
I'm working hard on it too.

718
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,080
But I've already done my best,

719
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,920
so I'll have no regrets
if I don't get it.

720
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,420
There's always a next time. Right?

721
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,000
- Must be nice.
- Sorry?

722
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,700
The luxury of trying again
even if you fail...

723
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,200
makes me jealous.

724
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,680
Never mind.
You came back for your umbrella.

725
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,340
Right! I should get going.

726
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,450
See you tomorrow.

727
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,810
Okay. Let's do this.

728
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,720
Let's nail this Children's Day,
the retail industry's high season!

729
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,650
Marron Confectionery's bestseller...

730
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,220
Just in time for Children's Day,
the retail industry's high season,

731
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,960
Marron Confectionery's
bestselling Choco Cup...

732
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,560
and the hero Yongki...

733
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,590
- have teamed up.
- Mom, did you grab the passports?

734
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
- Of course I did.
- The retail market's high season...

735
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,200
When Yu Jin's mom heard I was going
to Da Nang, she was so jealous.

736
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,170
You told her about it?
Of course I did.

737
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,670
- Let's hurry
- Gosh, it's so pretty.

738
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,280
You need money to get married.

739
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,220
Who would marry me
when I have no money or anything?

740
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,570
Hi, Mom.

741
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,100
Have you eaten?

742
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,180
No, I was just wondering
if you got your back looked at.

743
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,650
It felt better when I woke up,
so I just skipped it.

744
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,590
What? Why would you just skip it?
Since when are you a doctor?

745
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,290
I told you to go
get it treated properly.

746
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,590
Oh, forget it.

747
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,630
I think I know my own body.

748
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,500
I have to work. I'm hanging up.

749
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,360
Mom, just listen. Hello? Mom.

750
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,670
Hey, be quiet!

751
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,570
- Gosh!
- I said to be quiet, darn it.

752
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,110
Unbelievable.

753
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,610
What's his problem?

(Children's Day Promotion
Presentation Script)

755
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,920
Almost done. Okay.

756
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,500
Yongki and Choco Cup
have come together.

757
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,270
Maybe I should add a little echo?

758
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,870
Have come together...

759
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,610
Hey, you!

760
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,520
What? Who's there?
What are you doing?

761
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,720
Hey, open up!

762
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,250
Oh my gosh.

763
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,760
You were staring at me earlier.

764
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,430
Open the door!

765
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,030
What do you think you're doing?
Go away.

766
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,100
Open up.

767
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:27,070
You were staring at me, weren't you?
Why the dirty look?

768
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,540
I said go away! Please, just go.

769
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,280
- Open up.
- My laptop...

770
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,340
Open it.

(Marron Confectionery)

772
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,710
- All of my files are on there.
- Open up.

773
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,150
Come on, open the door.

774
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,620
Open it.

775
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,750
Oh no.

776
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,220
No, this can't be happening.

777
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,060
Open the door!

778
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,690
What if my laptop breaks?

779
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,490
If my files are gone,
I can't present anything.

780
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,200
If I can't present, no promotion!

781
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,230
And no promotion means no raise.

782
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,370
How can I pay for Mom's treatment?
No, wait.

783
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,910
I can't even afford to fix my phone.
Maybe I can get it fixed for free?

784
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,510
Wait a second. My phone?

785
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,510
- You crazy girl.
- Did you call for Maxbi?

786
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,580
My phone!

787
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,980
Come on, open up.

788
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,990
Hey, Maxbi! Call 112 for me.

789
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,420
- Calling 112.
- Open the darn door.

00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:37,370
Okay, for now, everyone can go home.
We'll be in touch tomorrow.

794
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,210
Make sure that jerk faces justice.

795
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,340
Or I'll deal with him myself.

796
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
Yes, ma'am.

797
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,550
She means it.

798
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,380
She'll rip a person to shreds.

799
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,820
Yes, we'll do our best.

800
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:55,960
All right, then.

801
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,090
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

802
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
Are you okay?

803
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,270
The file I was working on is gone.
I have to start all over.

804
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,470
The jerk...

805
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,910
That jerk. Tearing him apart
would be too good for him.

806
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,020
What are you working on?

807
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,120
Crying won't solve anything.
We have to redo it, and fast.

808
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,730
Gungseo or Myeongjo font?
What do you think?

809
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,130
- Myeongjo.
- Myeongjo font?

810
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,700
You have no idea how scared I was.

811
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,540
Don't you think left-aligning this
is easier to read?

812
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,780
- Center it.
- Center?

813
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,610
I have to do it all over again.
That jerk!

814
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,950
Does this look better in blue?

815
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Gosh.

816
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,460
Yes, I guess blue is better.

817
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,790
Pick an attitude and stick with it.

818
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,770
I can't tell if you're frustrated,
so it's a little confusing for us.

819
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,300
Fine. My attitude, then...

820
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,240
will be a J-curve.

821
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
What?

822
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,910
You said it yourself.

823
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,010
Even when it looks like a free fall,
it'll eventually shoot back up.

824
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,880
That's the J-curve.

825
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,050
That's me.

826
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,920
At the end of this adversity,

827
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,790
there's got to be a happy ending
waiting for me.

828
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,060
I can feel it.

829
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,830
To do that, you must first learn
how to trade crypto properly.

830
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,200
I will work really hard.

831
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,470
I'm going to give it my all.

832
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,410
Just don't get nervous.

833
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,280
Okay, breathe.

834
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,050
I'll do it. I can do this.

835
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,450
Okay, you got this.
Breathe in and out.

836
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
I can do this.

837
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,120
In and out.
Exhale. Just keep breathing.

838
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,720
(Touch the crazy girl
who lives here, and you're dead!)

839
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,690
Those jerks!

(Marron Confectionery)

841
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,700
We will now begin the presentations
for the Children's Day promotion.

842
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,470
First, we have Ms. Jung Round...

843
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,540
Ms. Jung Da Hae will present.

844
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,070
Absurdity?

845
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,270
Excuse me?

846
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,810
Director Ham?
Did you have anything to say first?

847
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,080
No. Please, start.

848
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,780
Yes.

849
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,220
In celebration of Children's Day,
the retail industry's high season,

850
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,820
Marron's bestselling Choco Cup...

851
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,060
teams up with the beloved Yongki.

852
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,360
For Children's Day,
we present the Yongki Special Edition.

853
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,430
I will now walk you through
the details.

(Choco Cup and Yongki Collaboration)

855
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,010
The Yongki Special Edition,
a limited Children's Day release...

856
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,640
That concludes my presentation.

857
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,090
What was that?

858
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,520
Did that go well,
or did I totally bomb?

859
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,490
I can't read their faces at all.

860
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:59,430
Next, Ms. Jung Da Hee will present.

861
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,400
Hold on.

862
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,140
Is that it for me? Just like that?

863
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,880
If you don't mind,

864
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,120
could I please get some feedback?

865
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,990
If there's anything I can improve,
I worked really hard preparing this.

866
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,420
I'm sure you did.

867
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,700
I interviewed you
three years ago, right?

868
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,630
Yes.

869
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,840
I thought you looked familiar.
Now I remember why.

00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,480
Thank you.
I will do my absolute best.

871
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,010
I promise I'll work really hard.

872
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,450
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

873
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,250
- You should go to the hospital.
- I'll work hard.

874
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,990
And it seems you've just kept
"working hard" ever since.

875
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,530
Thank you.

876
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,430
But by now,

877
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,200
shouldn't diligence be the process,
not the result?

878
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,540
If all you have to show is,
"I worked really hard,"

879
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,070
- then that's just...
- Who do you think you are?

880
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,940
- Feedback? It was terrible.
- It was... How do I put this?

881
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,680
- It's...
- Go back to your seat. Quickly.

882
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,020
Learn to read the room.

883
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:29,390
Da Hee, congratulations!
Congrats, Da Hee!

884
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,860
<i>Cheer up, baby</i>

885
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,990
<i>Just hang in a little bit more</i>

886
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,260
<i>A girl shouldn't give her heart away</i>
<i>so easily</i>

887
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,300
<i>So you'll fall for me even more</i>

888
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,410
<i>I'll act nonchalant,</i>
<i>like I don't care at all</i>

889
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,380
<i>So you won't know how I feel</i>

890
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,780
<i>Just get it together</i>

891
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,080
<i>And then, baby, cheer up</i>

892
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,850
She's so pretty.

893
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,550
All right.
Come on, everyone, have a drink.

894
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,290
To our Marketing Team!

895
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,820
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

896
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,660
Ms. Round!
It's your turn for a song. Let's go!

897
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,230
Mr. Ko!

898
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,970
Do you really think Da Hae
is in the mood for that right now?

899
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,610
Come on, this is just
part of the job, right?

900
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,910
You win some, you lose some.

901
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,810
Just because of one setback,

902
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,650
is she going to
make everyone uncomfortable

903
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,680
and have us all walk on eggshells
around her?

904
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,990
Okay.

905
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,900
- I'll sing a song.
- All right! A round of applause!

906
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,950
<i>In a corner of the pre-dawn sky</i>

907
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:06,250
<i>A shooting star suddenly appears</i>

908
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,490
<i>In the blink of an eye</i>

909
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,190
<i>Right above my head</i>

910
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:17,600
<i>Raining down on me like light</i>

911
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:22,500
<i>What a beautiful day</i>

912
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:29,510
<i>The sun and moon are on my side,</i>
<i>shining just for me</i>

913
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,310
<i>Please love me</i>

914
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,850
<i>Into my empty heart</i>

915
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:43,860
<i>Is now filled with shining stars</i>

916
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,280
You went through so much.

917
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,210
You worked really hard too, Ye Jin.

918
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,890
- Being an intern is hard, isn't it?
- Not tougher than your ordeal.

919
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,090
After the hardship you went through,

920
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,230
you got rejected for not being
a permanent employee.

921
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,630
I guess I'm a good punching bag.

922
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:31,300
Everyone's really hitting me
where it hurts today.

923
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,740
But, Ye Jin...

924
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,310
- It's not because I'm a temp...
- No, I overheard something.

925
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,180
They said this whole presentation
was rigged for the direct hires.

926
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,020
We were just there
to make them look good.

927
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,490
Apparently, everyone knew
except for us.

928
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,530
I'm quitting after my internship.

929
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,300
There's no way I can make it here...

930
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,170
as a temp hire.

931
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,980
Sorry. It happens.

932
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,750
If you're sorry, then come with us.

933
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,670
Come on, let's all do a cheer!
You have to drink with the group.

934
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,830
I'll head home early.

935
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,630
Okay, I will, Dad.

936
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,100
Okay.

937
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,310
Da Hae? What are you doing out here?

938
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,680
Why'd you do it?

939
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:21,410
What?

940
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,850
Telling me "good luck"
the day before the presentation,

941
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,790
were you just mocking me?

942
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,530
Because you knew
I didn't stand a chance.

943
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,700
Da Hae, you've had a lot to drink.
Are you okay?

944
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,670
No, I'm not just saying this
because I'm drunk...

945
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,270
Fine.

946
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,540
Since I'm drunk anyway,
I might as well keep rambling.

947
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,840
Why am I the only one
who gets an Americano?

948
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:58,620
Everyone else gets their
Frappes and Lattes.

949
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:02,720
You get them whatever they want
from the menu,

950
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,530
but why do you always...

951
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:10,260
fob me off with
the "buy ten, get one free" coffee?

952
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,370
I brought you a coffee.
This is for you.

953
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,530
I brought everyone a coffee.

954
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,140
Here, this one's for you, Da Hae.

955
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,640
Goodness, I'm sorry.

956
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,440
You never said anything
when I gave you an Americano, so...

957
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,450
But you always asked everyone else
what they wanted to drink.

958
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,310
You asked them.

959
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,780
I'm not sure why I did that...

960
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,150
But I do.

961
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,720
I know why you did it.

962
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:39,930
It's because...

963
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,330
I'm the kind of person
it's okay to treat that way.

964
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:50,900
That's why...

965
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:53,970
the presentation...

966
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:55,910
Everyone just...

967
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,580
looks down on me.

968
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:03,920
They treat me like I'm nothing.

969
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,550
I'm so sorry.

970
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:11,220
But I thought you liked Americanos.

971
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,730
I really didn't mean anything by it.

972
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,460
Yes, I can tell.

973
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,500
You don't look to be the type
to hold a grudge,

974
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,030
or bitter...

975
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,810
Your life doesn't seem hard enough
for that, Da Hee.

976
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,180
Which actually pisses me off
even more, though.

977
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,350
It's just the alcohol talking.

978
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,890
Just forget I said anything.

979
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:49,300
Da Hae!
But you really did work hard on it.

980
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,130
Let's both try even harder
from now on.

981
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,800
We've got this!

982
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,670
- "Harder?"
- You're just so kind!

983
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:00,770
Even if you're not the best,
you just have to work hard in life.

984
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,910
Stop it.

985
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,950
Finish the presentation this week.
It's a fast track to the promotion.

986
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,180
I said, stop it.

987
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,850
After the hardship you went through,

988
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:10,650
you got rejected for not being
a permanent employee.

989
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,980
Diligence...

990
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,550
I can't.

991
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,360
Let's both try even harder
from now on.

992
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,190
I'm not doing it anymore.

993
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,800
I said I'm not doing it anymore.

994
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,900
I almost hit innocent Da Hee.

995
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,040
For three years, I'd endured my job,
feeling my spirit sink lower daily.

996
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,610
In the end, my diligence
had become my inferiority.

997
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,400
Jung Da Hae, you've really...

998
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,470
hit rock bottom now.

999
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,310
Kang Eun Sang.

1000
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,250
Nothing's going right.

1001
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,550
Not a single thing.
Not a darn thing.

1002
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,560
- I can see that.
- But...

1003
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:33,060
Turns out one thing
is actually going my way.

1004
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:37,460
Look at that, a J-curve.

1005
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,330
Gosh, what's this?

1006
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:43,970
Eun Sang. I...

1007
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,570
I was hoping my career
would hit a J-curve.

1008
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,680
But that darn J-curve
showed up here instead.

1009
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,850
While my life is hitting
absolute rock bottom.

1010
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:03,820
Even at a tragic time like this,
the only thing on the rise is that.

1011
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,220
This darn crypto.

1012
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:06,790
Did you only put in ten bucks?

1013
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:10,260
Hey, that was a big spend for me.
Gosh.

1014
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:11,960
I'll bet.

1015
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,470
Hey.

1016
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,040
I just don't know anymore.

1017
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,170
Should I be happy about this
or angry?

1018
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,080
Be happy, of course.
Money goes to those who love it.

1019
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:29,550
I made 50 cents.
Is this why everyone's into crypto?

1020
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,820
That's because
you only put in ten...

1021
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,990
How much cash do you have
on you right now?

1022
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,490
I've got 1.50 dollars.

1023
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,090
I couldn't even buy
a single bottle of soju.

1024
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,060
That's something to be proud of.
Seriously.

1025
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,630
Okay, so you made 50 cents
from crypto.

1026
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,400
So now you have two bucks, right?

1027
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,170
Look, I get it.

1028
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,040
Nothing's going your way,
and you're pissed off.

1029
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,180
So you think you can take it out
on some innocent person.

1030
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,710
Snap out of it, girl!

1031
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,420
Gosh, you scared me.

1032
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,650
A presentation can't change
your life.

1033
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,220
Here, eat this.

1034
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:07,920
You need money.

1035
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,920
Whether
it's 50 cents or 5,000 dollars.

1036
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,660
That's the only way
your life will change.

1037
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,590
But still with this little bit
of money?

1038
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,100
Want to get some air?

1039
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,130
See if this money can actually
change anything.

1040
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,470
(Tteokbokki: 2 dollars)

1041
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,720
Is it good?

1042
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,090
Yes.

1043
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,360
You know, this is definitely...

1044
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,860
Eating this actually does make me
feel better.

1045
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,700
I guess I haven't hit rock bottom
after all.

1046
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,770
That's the power of money for you.
Got it?

1047
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,440
Yes.

1048
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,610
- What are you doing?
- I'm full, trying to sober up.

1049
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:11,150
I totally blew up at Da Hee.
What am I supposed to do now?

1050
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:17,760
Ouch. Why does my forehead hurt?

1051
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:19,990
Did you do something stupid?

1052
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,630
(Two hours earlier)

1053
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,280
Gosh, you scared me!

1054
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,580
I...

1055
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,280
I just wanted to ask you something.

1056
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,250
That song from earlier...

1057
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,220
How do you know that song?

1058
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,120
What?

1059
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,090
What song?

1060
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,060
The one you were just singing
at the bar.

1061
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:54,490
How do you know it?

1062
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,630
It's just a song I like.

1063
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,930
Right, but how?
It's not a well-known song. So how?

1064
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,610
I can like it if I want to.
Am I not allowed to like it?

1065
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,310
That's not what I meant,
it's just...

1066
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,340
- You must have hipsteritis.
- Excuse me? What?

1067
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:16,220
Or is this by some artist only
you're supposed to know about?

1068
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,720
If not that, then...

1069
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,820
do you just think my taste in music
sucks?

1070
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,250
No.

1071
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,120
So now you're going to critique
my taste in music, too?

1072
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,360
- No, that's not it at all.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

1073
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,330
Look.

1074
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,700
- What?
- Sorry, but can we do this later?

1075
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,770
As you're probably aware,

1076
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:43,380
I've had a really rough day today.

1077
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,950
You can just try harder next time.

1078
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,320
I just want to know how on earth
you know that song...

1079
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,190
Try harder?

1080
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,660
Yes, try harder.

1081
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,700
What's with your eyes?

1082
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,770
Your eyes are a little...

1083
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,370
unhinged.

1084
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:16,010
You look unhinged.
Why are you getting closer?

1085
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,180
Why are you coming closer?
Gosh, what's wrong?

1086
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,650
I'm done trying harder!

1087
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,310
(To the Moon)

1088
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,040
How wasted was I last night?

1089
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:24,010
I didn't do anything stupid, did I?

1090
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,150
Dr. Ham, what brings you here?

1091
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,780
- Don't we have things to discuss?
- Ta-da!

1092
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,220
- You're still insisting on Beijing?
- I just think something's off.

1093
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,290
- I hear he's been hard to reach.
- He's cheating, I'm telling you!

1094
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,760
You've got to be kidding me.
You really made that much so fast?

1095
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:39,860
- Put a bit more into crypto.
- I shouldn't do it.

1096
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:40,930
Oh, no, sir...

1097
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:41,930
Well, no wonder.

1098
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:43,930
All that trouble
was over that measly bit of money.

1099
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,940
