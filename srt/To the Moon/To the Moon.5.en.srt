(Sprout Daycare Talent Show)

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,380
You know what this is, right?
A talent show.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,720
Kids who aren't even ten yet...

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,550
are playing drums
and waving fans around.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,290
You know, they put on a talent show
that's on a whole other level.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
I was in one of those too.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,360
I was actually cast as the lead.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,060
Cinderella, no less.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,330
I wasn't chosen to be Cinderella
because I was pretty.

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,930
I was just really good
at rock-paper-scissors.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,470
I beat Se Young, the prettiest girl
in our class, with paper.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,710
Anyway, since I was a princess,

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,580
I was so excited I'd finally get
to wear a gorgeous dress.

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,510
But then my mom told me...

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,620
she wasn't going to buy a dress...

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,050
that I'd only wear once
for the show.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,190
So, in the end,

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,590
I got demoted
to playing an oak tree.

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,800
And I just stood there blankly
in a dark corner of the stage.

23
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,770
I think that's when it hit me.

24
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,700
I wasn't meant to be the lead
for my whole life.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,170
The very back corner of the stage,
with nowhere else to go.

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,280
I felt that would be the only part
I'd ever get to have in life.

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,480
But hey, it ended up being helpful.

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,880
It's like I learned my place.

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,050
- Figuring out where you stand?
- I see.

30
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,950
Thanks for sharing.

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,930
Next, I'll tell you guys
a story from when I was 13.

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,960
What, another story?

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,930
Aren't you guys going to sleep?

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,030
- No!
- Why not?

35
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,830
Because it's Sunday night.

36
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,900
If we go to sleep now,
we'll have to go to work.

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,970
Don't go to sleep. We can't
let the weekend end this way.

38
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,910
I hate Mondays so much!
Come on, let's talk about anything.

39
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,180
Forget it. I'm going to bed.
Stop fighting it and just sleep.

40
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,620
Don't go. Come back.

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,250
Come back!

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,290
- It was when I was eight.
- What?

(Lab Safety Rules)

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,340
I feel like
it's not quite sweet enough.

46
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,840
Is the batter cooked differently?

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,680
Since we can't use the machine,

48
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,650
I guess we'll have to accept
that the taste will be different.

49
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,620
I know it's a lot of trouble,

50
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,590
but could we adjust the batter
and do it just one more time?

51
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,630
Sure, why not?

52
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,760
It's for the founding anniversary,
so a little trouble is nothing.

53
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,600
How many years was it again?

54
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,070
It's the 30th anniversary.

55
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,200
Our 30th founding anniversary.

56
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,640
Since it's our 30th anniversary,

57
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,310
we've also specially invited 30 kids
who love our company's snacks.

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,580
- Okay, got it.
- Watch out!

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,790
Oh, no.

60
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,100
No. What do I do? Give it to me.

61
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,960
Oh, gosh.
I'll get something to clean this up.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,330
- Just a second, okay?
- Okay.

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Goodness.

65
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
Darn it.

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,180
Who is this?

67
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,980
Want to have dinner together later?

68
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,290
I know a famous pork cutlet place
near Namsan.

69
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,420
I'm afraid I can't.
I'm too busy-bee-bop-a-lula.

70
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,790
You said you were busy
yesterday too.

71
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,990
And the day before that.

72
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,030
You're not avoiding me, are you?

73
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,200
No, of course not.
I love pork cutlet, but...

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,500
Yodelayheehoo.

75
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,100
I really was busy yester...

76
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,140
Why isn't this working?

77
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,000
I was really busy yesterday...
You go to Hawaii.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,140
because
we're prepping for the event.

79
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,570
Get ready. Mic check, 1, 2.

80
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,950
I've been patient so far,
but turn off autocomplete and talk.

81
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,180
This stupid autocomplete, seriously.
How do I fix this?

82
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,220
- Gosh. Yes?
- Da Hae.

83
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,520
Here, at least put this on.

84
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,550
Oh, no, I couldn't...

85
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
Why do you look like that?

86
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,600
Didn't you just come
from the factory?

87
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,200
What's with your outfit?

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,470
Well...

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
The supervisor accidentally spilled
a container of sauce on me.

90
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,370
I have spare clothes
in the call room,

91
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,810
so I was going to change later.

92
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,610
Didn't I tell you
that would be a huge pain?

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,050
Doing all of that by hand
is not an easy job.

94
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,450
But the kids invited for tomorrow
are most excited about it.

95
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,650
Dondonchip.

96
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,720
It's a shame
we can't use the machines...

97
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,790
because it is a limited edition.

98
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,860
- But...
- What?

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,270
Why am I the only one
who has to suffer...

100
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,600
and take all the heat?

101
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,540
Who's getting the award tomorrow?

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,510
The Excellent Work Ethic Award.

103
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,640
Who's getting it?

104
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,840
It's you, Ms. Round.

105
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,210
But Da Hee and Jun Seo
are getting it too.

106
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,850
You should be thankful
you are one of the three.

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Honestly, I'm only...

108
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,020
saying this now.

109
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,590
But do you know...

110
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,190
the world of pain I went through
to get you in there?

111
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,890
You're not even grateful.

112
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,090
Hold on.

113
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,360
So you don't want the award?
Fine, I'll take you off the list.

114
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,930
No.

115
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,500
What about the delivery company?

116
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,670
Da Hee is taking care of that.

117
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,310
Da Hee was supposed to? Da Hee?

118
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,740
Where's Da Hee?

119
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,040
She's filming a company promo video.

120
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,250
She was chosen as an in-house model.

121
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Right. They're showing that
at the event tomorrow, right?

122
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,080
Who was the male model again?

123
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,450
Mr. Ko.

124
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,060
- It's Dr. Ham.
- Right.

125
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,590
Dr. Ham?

126
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,460
They look good together.

127
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,360
They really do look good together.

128
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,930
It's like they hog
all the good looks.

129
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,100
Tell me about it.

130
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,270
They look amazing together.

131
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,000
Now I see why they call Da Hee
the princess of Marron.

132
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,270
I can totally see why.

133
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,910
Oh, please. A princess?

134
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,180
Hold on.

135
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh, gosh. Hang on.

136
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,050
Cut!

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,020
Sir. This is a company promo video.

138
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,830
But right now,
your expression is like...

139
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,500
You look like the chief mourner
at a wake.

140
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,330
You looked so tragic,
I almost bowed in condolence.

141
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,240
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Whatever.

142
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,570
We'll have
a voice-over on the video.

143
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,380
I'll read you the lines,
so match your expression to them.

144
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,550
A place that leads the way
in fun and wholesome food.

145
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,850
- The FDA?
- Wrong!

146
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,950
Marron.
A place of passionate camaraderie.

147
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,920
- The army.
- Marron.

148
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,820
A place my soul longs for.

149
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,490
My bed in my room.

150
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,700
Marron.
Forever Maron. Together with Maron.

151
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,100
I love you, Marron.

152
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,340
Show company pride in your face.

153
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,070
Like you actually love working here.

154
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,310
(Today is Happy Marron Day)

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Like this?

156
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,790
I guess it's a three-day funeral.

157
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,050
The funeral's not over yet.

158
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,090
What's that now?

159
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,560
- Hey, Assistant Director!
- Yes.

160
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Why aren't you doing crowd control?

161
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,370
Why haven't you?

162
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,670
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,740
Excuse me,
could you please step back?

164
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,410
- Gosh.
- Hey, you!

165
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,370
I said to get back!

166
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,880
I said, get back!

167
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,150
Madam!

168
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,650
Madam? Me?

169
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,090
- Hurry up.
- Get over here.

170
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,960
Just a moment.

171
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,830
By any chance...

172
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,370
What? Did he recognize me?

173
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,370
Ma'am, are they serving pork cutlet
in the company cafeteria today?

174
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,520
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- What's with her?

175
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,220
- Darn it.
- What's wrong with her?

176
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,290
I could just die.

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,800
Isn't it hilarious?

178
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,000
Jung Da Hee, Jung Da Hae.

179
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,300
Our names are practically the same,

180
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,170
but she's "princess,"
and I'm "madam."

181
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,210
And you know what?
I could even let that slide.

182
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,140
But...

183
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,580
he told me...

184
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,350
to get out of the way.

185
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,120
He said,
"Madam, get out of the way."

186
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,520
- Are you laughing?
- No.

187
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,290
I told you to put more effort
into your appearance.

188
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,500
Based on what people wear,
you can split them into two groups.

189
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,000
"Gosh, they must be well-off."

190
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,770
"Gosh, I hope they do better."

191
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,970
You guys are sometimes...

192
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,980
I bow to Buddha.

193
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,980
That's it. I'm just going to die.

194
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,380
It'll be easier.

195
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,280
No more embarrassment if I'm dead.

196
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,220
Now's not the time to die.

197
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,090
It's time for a transformation.

198
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,490
What?

199
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,020
Ta-da! Made in Boutique Magal.

200
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,830
I present a brand-new, unworn item,
100 percent silk cotton...

201
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,090
with the tags on.

202
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,330
I'll lend it to you
as a special favor.

203
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,800
What am I supposed to do with this?

204
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,530
I heard there was a party tomorrow.

205
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,240
Isn't your team in charge of it?

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,540
Come on. It's hardly a party.

207
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,210
Don't tell me
they're leaving you out.

208
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,440
- Are they icing you out too?
- What?

209
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,540
You're wearing this tomorrow!
Got it?

210
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,910
And you're getting an award.

211
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,410
It's the perfect day
for a transformation.

212
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,980
What am I, a Power Ranger?
Why would I transform?

213
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,250
Da Hae. Dr. Ham is...

214
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,750
someone who's...

215
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,750
always at the top
of the real-time search list.

216
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,960
What's that supposed to mean?

217
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,090
He's the man of the hour.

218
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,390
The lead man gets the leading lady.

219
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,000
But looking the way you do now...

220
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,940
Hey, don't you want a shot
with Dr. Ham?

221
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,940
(Ham Ji Woo)

222
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,110
The cafeteria
has pork cutlets today.

223
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,450
For crying out loud.

224
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,450
What is he, a pork cutlet ambassador
or something?

225
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,750
One second.

226
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,420
I heard you were serving
pork cutlets today.

227
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,990
- Who told you that?
- I'm sure someone said so earlier.

228
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,960
Pork cutlets are great and all,

229
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,700
but if we're seen eating together
at the cafeteria,

230
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,000
wouldn't that look a little weird?

231
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,940
People might get the wrong idea.

232
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,410
The wrong idea about what?

233
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,280
No one's going to think
anything of it.

234
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,710
(Jung Da Hae: F...)

235
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,850
What's this?

236
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,250
Goodness, my autocomplete
is acting up again.

237
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,420
Anyway, I already had lunch.

238
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,520
Bye.

239
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620
This...

240
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,630
seems pretty intentional.

241
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,160
It's just tteokgalbi.
Would you want one?

242
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,370
No, I'm fine.

243
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,040
Thank you. Have a good one.

244
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,580
Oh, Hee Jung!

245
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,750

246
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
Why are you taking...

247
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,520
Are you quitting?

248
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,050
Yes.

249
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,020
It just happened so.

250
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,720
So you didn't renew your contract?

251
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,090
It's not that I didn't. I couldn't.

252
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,160
You know how it is.

253
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,400
Oh, right.

254
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,440
You're leaving with no party?
Why are you all alone?

255
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,210
They didn't even add me
to the O.O group chat.

256
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,980
Do you really think they'd throw me
a farewell dinner?

257
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,580
I'm not even holding my breath.

258
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,980
Our team did a great job
wrapping up accounts,

259
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,650
and we passed the audit flawlessly,

260
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,150
so the company gave us a bonus.

261
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,330
You've all worked really hard,
so treat yourselves to a nice meal.

262
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,230
- Thank you.
- Let's not have pork anymore.

263
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,630
Should we try somewhere new
this time?

264
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,270
Okay, if you all have a place
you'd like to eat,

265
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,070
post suggestions in the chat.
I'll put together a list.

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,470
Oh, gosh.

267
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,410
- We could get some nice beef...
- We could have that.

268
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,680
Can we really get beef?

(30th Anniversary Event
Seating Chart)

270
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
All right!

271
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,220
What's the key to tomorrow's event?

272
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,250
It's...

273
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,220
the seating chart.

274
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,530
Most important is Table One,
known as the Marron VIP table.

275
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,500
Our top executives will be here,
so all eyes will be on this table.

276
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,330
Who should be
the stars of this table?

277
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,700
Let's hear some ideas.

278
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,170
Then we need someone who has
common ground with them, right?

279
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,870
For the record,

280
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,710
the senior managing director and I
went to the same high school.

281
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,410
I went to the same university.

282
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,110
But you were at
a satellite campus, Ji Won.

283
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,920
- We had the same president.
- Sure.

284
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,580
I served with him in the army.

285
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,650
He was exempt from military service.

286
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,950
Or at least,
that's what I wish I could say.

287
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Does everyone really want Table One?

288
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,490
Why?

289
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,260
You'd be sharing a table with him.
Isn't that a little intimidating?

290
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,100
I'm fine with sitting anywhere.

291
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,930
What? Why would you say that?

292
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,400
- Dr. Ham will be at Table One too.
- Dr. Ham.

293
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,310
There's an unofficial team legend
about Table One.

294
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,280
If you sit there,
you get promoted in a year.

295
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,780
Not that you're interested,
of course.

296
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,880
"Of course?"

297
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,750
I'll have you know
I'm quite ambitious myself.

298
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,280
Really? My mistake.

299
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,390
- Anyway, for tomorrow...
- Hey.

300
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,290
Who has the Milk Tarte
performance report?

301
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,390
I have it,
but do you need it right now?

302
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,190
- You're not going to give it to me?
- I'll get it right away, sir.

303
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,460
Hurry up!

304
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Ms. Round.

305
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,070
You still haven't changed
out of that?

306
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,670
Go change now!

307
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,200
This is a workplace,
not a playground.

308
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,870
I just changed into this.

309
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,240
The color is pretty similar to
the hygiene suit from earlier.

310
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,780
How is this even remotely similar?

311
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,880
Don't get mad.

312
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,410
It's a big day, so I'm being honest.

313
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,650
Besides, like you said yourself,
it's an intimidating table,

314
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,350
so you really have to be dressed
to the nines for it, you know?

315
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,550
So...

316
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,520
what you're saying is that
I don't belong at a table like that.

317
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,460
I'm just saying
that's how important the table is.

318
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,260
That's strange.

319
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,030
All this time,
I thought I knew where I belonged,

320
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,000
but right now, I'm starting
to have second thoughts.

321
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,440
Forget "knowing my place."

322
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,510
Got it?

323
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,950
Nope, I don't get it.
Let's just be fair about this.

324
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,510
- What?
- I'm sorry,

325
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,550
but I'm starting to want
that important seat too.

326
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,620
So, what can we do?

327
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,050
There's only one way to settle this.

328
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,420
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

Actually, no.
I'll just buy it off you.

(Assistant Manager Oh Dong Gyu)

354
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,030
How do I look?

355
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,070
I guess you can forget the oak tree.

356
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,140
Ta-da!

357
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,480
You're definitely going to be
the star of the party tomorrow.

358
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,520
Goodness.

359
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,250
This is amazing.

360
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,790
Guys!

361
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,250
I actually look pretty good,
don't I?

362
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,860
Come on, you look way better
than just "pretty good."

363
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,690
So you can do your
hair and makeup just like this...

364
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,060
again tomorrow, right?

365
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,500
You watched me, so you should be
able to do it yourself.

366
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Wait a minute.
How am I supposed to do this myself?

367
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,970
You're a natural,
and I'm all thumbs.

368
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,140
What?

369
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,510
Then what am I supposed to do?

370
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,680
Where should I put down the bedding?

371
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,910
Should I put it here? Or over there?

372
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,420
- I'm picky about where I sleep.
- Don't be ridiculous.

373
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,880
- I'll put it down here.
- Okay.

377
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,560
What am I doing here
with this pain in my neck?

What's wrong?

381
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,250
Are you playing a funeral dirge?
What's with you all of a sudden?

382
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,250
- Ju Man.
- What?

383
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,250
I'm kind of talking to this girl,

384
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,920
but she won't grab a meal with me.
What am I supposed to make of that?

385
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,490
Then I'd say you two
aren't really a thing.

386
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,590
What if I want to be a thing
with her?

387
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,830
You have to get a meal together.

388
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,260
- And if she won't grab a meal?
- Then it's not a thing.

389
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,500
- If I want to be a thing with her?
- I think we could do this all day.

390
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,840
- And if she won't grab a meal?
- You little...

391
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,470
Let's drop it.
I'm just not feeling it.

392
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,110
Fine, let's drop it.

393
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,320
Forget making a comeback
and just be happy as the kids' president.

394
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,750
Your Kids' YouTube views are insane.

395
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,850
Look at this!
You have 3.1 million views.

Gosh, Ji Woo-tube!

397
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,230
As long as you keep treating me
to expensive tuna, we're good.

398
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,630
Are you messing with me right now?

399
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,000
Messing with you? You punk.
You started it.

400
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,940
Hey, do you have any idea
how many jobs I need just for rent?

401
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,640
Even wasting time with you like this
is a luxury I can't afford.

402
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,910
Hey, don't be so dramatic.

403
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,210
- But how do I make it a thing?
- Get out.

404
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,680
- What?
- Are you not leaving?

405
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,850
- I'm leaving.
- Leave, you jerk.

406
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,420
Leave, you jerk. Get lost.

407
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,290
Get out of here, you punk!

409
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,030
We might finally go somewhere trendy

- I'm just enjoying the moment.
- Enjoying what?

415
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,210
It feels like a magic spell
that'll break at midnight.

416
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,280
Eun Sang, I honestly feel like
I'm becoming Cinderella.

417
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,290
Not quite.

Cinderella's magic ends at midnight,

419

but for us,
when the clock strikes midnight...

420
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,090
Ta-da! It went up again.
Another 50 dollars.

421
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,060
That's amazing.

422
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,530
No more crypto talk.
I hate it, so please stop.

423

Do you really think
Ji Song won't invest with us?

426

But the market's so hot right now.

427
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,940
We'll have to see.

428
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,150
But you won't just "wait and see,"
will you?

429
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,820
Of course not.
I'm going to break her.

430
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,620
I'll make her do it, no matter what.
That crazy brat.

431
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,190
You're like her mother.

432
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,690
Did you give birth to her?

433
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,930
I did.

434
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,030
What?

435
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,970
If I'd had her,
she'd be much better.

436
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,040
Imagine if she took after me.

437
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,870
She'd be a judge or prosecutor.

438
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,170
Would she end up as
just Kim Ji Song?

439
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,170

to my face.

What do you have so much
to talk about?

445
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,490
Just a second.

446
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,990

a very important conversation.

447

try Ristera in Seongsu-dong.

made by an Italian chef.

Ello Kitchen? The one
with a six-month waiting list?

456
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,280
I can never get one either.

457
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,250
You want to go there?
We can make it happen.

458
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,590
What are you talking about?
They're totally booked for tomorrow.

You're not just bluffing, are you?

460
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,690

is still a work function.

462
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,900
No, I didn't.
I go there all the time.

463
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,230
You're a regular?
So you can call and get us a table?

464
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,340
No way.

465
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,270
Then I guess our regular, Ji Song,
can book the place for our dinner.

466
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,610
Good! Thanks, Ji Song.

467
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,850
Are you some kind of punk?

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,010
Excuse me?

469
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,150
You are a punk, aren't you?
Unless you're a punk,

470
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,350
there's no way you could
make someone feel this pathetic.

471
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,790
But you're getting the wrong idea.

472
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,360
Just because
I'm always reaching out,

473
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,560
asking you out for a meal,

474
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,730
I think you're misreading
this whole situation.

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,800
I was just being polite. That's all.
I mean, you know how it is.

After what happened between us,

477
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,630
if we avoid each other,
it will hurt.

478
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,400
So I was just trying to be friendly,
but then you avoid me like this...

479
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,440
Oh, you're breaking up.
Are you driving?

480
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,550
Yes. Look, if you're free,
let's meet up.

481
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,280
We need to clear this up.

482
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,820
Besides, I'm near your place anyway.

483
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,390
Near my place, where?
Are you in Sillim?

484
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,420
Right, Sillim.
Yes, I'm right around there.

485

487
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,330
Right, Daebang-dong.
I'm right near the station there.

488

The closest station
is actually Singil Station.

Right, Singil.
That's exactly where I am.

490
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,440
Not sure where you are,
but I happen to be with my friends.

491
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,370
Right, friends. Friends...

492
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,040
Friends?
What are you, an idol group?

493
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,450
You all live together?
Why are you hanging out so late?

494
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,710
Anyway, let's meet tomorrow.

495
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,850
I was planning to sit next to you
at the event tomorrow.

496
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,660
We can have a meal together,
and if the CEO's speech drags on,

497
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,120
we can trash-talk him a bit.

498
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,990
You don't like the sound of that?

499
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,870
Oh, you were
just asking to be polite.

500
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,240
I guess I just didn't get the hint.

501
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,440
I thought you couldn't hear me.

502
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,810
Well, I don't know
my schedule for tomorrow.

503
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,080
I'll need time to think about it.

504
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,380
Of course.

505
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,910
Then take your time and tell...

506
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,650
All right. Let's do it.

507
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,150
You thought about it
for all of five seconds.

508
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,150
My apologies.
I kept you waiting for so long.

509
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,160
So tomorrow,

510
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,990
we're definitely meeting.

511
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,960
And you'd better sit next to me.

512
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,100

(Doctor Ham Ji Woo, Jung Da Hae)

520
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,340
(Jung Da Hae)

521
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,270
(Jung Da Hae)

522
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,570
(Jung Da Hae)

523
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
(CEO Kwak Ki Taek)

524
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,490
What are you doing?
Why did you remove my name?

525
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,090
Oh, Da Hae. Oh, right.

526
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,060
The CEO is going to be here.
He was supposed to be on a trip,

527
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,530
but he came back early.

528
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,500
- So?
- What?

529
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,430
The CEO wants to sit next to Dr. Ham.

530
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,800
Yours is the only seat
we can switch.

531
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,940
Here you go.

532
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,570
(Jung Da Hae)

533
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,140
Come on, that's not fair.

534
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,110
We should sit
where we were assigned.

535
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,010
Excuse me?
Are you saying you'll defy the CEO?

536
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,210
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- Oh, Mr. Kwak!

537
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,780
Where's my seat?

538
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,850
Right here, sir!

539
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,860
(CEO Kwak Ki Taek)

540
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,920
Right.

541
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,030
- Go on, have a seat.
- Okay.

542
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,210
- Is there really no way?
- I'm sorry, we're fully booked.

543
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:43,020
But it's my mother's lifelong dream.

544
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,290
Oh, I can't believe I gave birth
to this little troublemaker.

545
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,030
You see, my mother was adopted
when she was young...

546
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,800
by a family overseas.

547
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,500
So,

548
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,570
at a place that truly captures
the feeling of her homeland...

549
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,440
This is an Italian restaurant.

550
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,210
She's Italian.

551
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,180
So, you see, she was adopted
and brought to Korea.

552
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,980
Buongiorno.

553
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,480
Tiamo. Grazie. Knock it off, eh?

554
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,550
Knock it off, eh?

555
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,390
Knock it off, eh?

556
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,660
Grazie.

557
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,190
- Could you please come back later?
- Sir.

558
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,730
Do you really want me to throw
a massive pity party right here?

559
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,370
I'd make a scene and embarrass you,
and people would start recording us.

560
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,340
And then post it all over YouTube.

561
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,340
Look.

562
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,940
I don't want to make you
a viral sensation.

563
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,140
Mom, I'm so sorry.

564
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,280
I'm telling you,
we are completely booked, ma'am.

565
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,520
Sir.

566
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,820
The seven o'clock party
just canceled.

567
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,220
Kim Ji Song!
Reservation for 6 at 7 p.m. tonight.

568
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,230
Wait, but you just said it was
for you and your mother.

569
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,200
Hey, I made the reservation.
No take-backs.

570
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,260
And also,
if it's not too much trouble,

571
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,600
could you please pretend
we're close?

572
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,400
Like I come here
about five times a week...

573
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,070
and order the priciest tasting menu
like it's nothing.

574
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,780
You know, like I'm one
of your elegant regulars.

575
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,550
Excuse me?

576
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,650
Mamma mia! She's insane.

577
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,050
Thank you.

578
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,160
Okay, reservation's set.

579
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,320
Hey, we've got some time to kill.
Let's go to the department store.

580
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,490
Why the department store?

581
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,960
Didn't you see the decor in there?

582
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,230
I've got to splurge
to match the vibe.

583
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,530
Gosh, you lied about my nationality,
and now you're excited?

584
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,400
Why lie about being a regular
of an expensive restaurant...

585
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,570
in the first place?

586
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,240
Well, it's because...

587
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,940
- the group chat...
- What do you possibly gain...

588
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,810
from lying just to show off?

589
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,810
What I gain?

590
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,350
Photos.

591
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,320
They're great for my social media.
And since we're coworkers,

592
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,890
I thought we could get
a nice picture together as a team.

593
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,890
A photo you post on social media,
all dolled up at a fancy place.

594
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,560
Do you really think
that's your life?

595
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,260
Real life is...

596
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,530
what happens outside
of that photo, Ji Song.

597
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,740
Gosh, what's your point?

598
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,970
My point is,
let's stop pretending...

599
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,110
and start living an authentic life.

600
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,280
- Why don't we do crypto...
- Don't you dare bring up crypto.

601
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,920
I'm not listening. I don't want to!

602
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,020
- No!
- Crypto!

603
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,250
- Stop it!
- That kid, I swear.

604
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,460
But why haven't I heard from her?
I hope she's doing all right.

605
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
Gosh.

606
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,100
(Baking happiness
into everyone's daily lives)

607
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,170
Marron Confectionery.

608
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,500
Forever, Marron! Together, Marron!

609
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,970
We love you, Marron!

610
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,170
(Marron Confectionery)

611
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,240
We love you!

612
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,480
- Marron!
- Marron!

613
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,250
Gosh, Dr. Ham,
you're a natural on camera.

614
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,290
- Thanks.
- Goodness.

615
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,520
I was told I looked like an actor
back in the day.

616
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,920
You know Leslie Cheung?

617
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,000
They called me the Leslie Cheung
of Gaepo-dong.

618
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,400
Way to disrespect the dead.

619
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,670
This table looks a little different
from the others.

620
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,170
There are flowers,

621
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,170
and there's a cushion just for me?

622
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,180
You're right. It's almost as if
someone prepared it.

623
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,250
Everyone, have you seen the movie,
"Days of Being Wild?"

624
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,120
There's a scene
where Leslie Cheung...

625
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,790
Is there anyone who can survive
without our products?

626
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,560
Where are you sitting?
I'm with Gaepo-dong's Leslie Cheung.

627
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,390
Did you just raise your hand
over there?

628
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,790
Da Hae?

629
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,300
Oh, hi.

630
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,830
This seat is empty, right?

631
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,230
Yes.

632
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,840
Weren't you supposed to sit
at Table One tonight?

633
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,570
Why did the CEO...

634
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,910
It's just how it worked out.

635
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,910
But you should be sitting up front.
Why are you back here?

636
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,020
Because I wanted to sit with you.

637
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,190
I really want to get closer to you.

638
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,790
Oh...

639
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,190
Sure, it'd be nice
to be friends, but...

640
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,970
Perfect. We can go up together
to get our award later, right?

641
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,370
Oh, right, the award.

642
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,300
Sure, let's go up together.

643
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,270
Next, to recognize the hard work
of all our employees,

644
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,780
we'll begin the awards presentation.

645
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
It's starting.

646
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,910
I'll announce the recipients
right away.

647
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,780
Winners are Ms. Jung Da Hee,
Mr. Yoon Jun Seo,

648
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,020
and Ms. Jung Da Hae
from the Marketing Team.

649
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,020
Due to time constraints,

650
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,660
Ms. Jung Da Hee
will accept the award for the team.

651
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,020
Ms. Jung Da Hee.

652
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,930
Jung Da Hee!

653
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,460
Nice.

654
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,830
Please come up to the stage.

655
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,230
Oh, well, it's...

656
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,130
What are you doing?

657
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,440
Go on.
They're calling for you, Da Hee.

658
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,870
- We love you, Jung Da Hee!
- We love you, Jung Da Hee!

659
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,440
- Picture-perfect Jung Da Hee!
- Picture-perfect Jung Da Hee!

660
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,710
Marketing Team!

661
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,380
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

662
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,550
Fourteenth Class!

663
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,890
- Fourteenth Class!
- Fourteenth Class!

664
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,420
- Fourteenth Class!
- Fourteenth Class!

665
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,120
- Fourteenth Class!
- Fourteenth Class!

666
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,560
What a heartwarming moment
with her colleagues' zealous support.

667
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,530
Please come join me on stage
right here.

668
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,100
And now, for the award presentation.

669
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,800
(Excellent Work Ethic Award,
Jung Da Hee and 2 others)

670
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,840
"The Excellent Work Ethic Award,
Jung Da Hee and two others."

671
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:43,780
"For your diligent work ethic
and responsibility in your duties,"

672
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,950
"you have been a shining example
to your colleagues."

673
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,850
"In recognition
of your contributions,"

674
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,820
"we are pleased
to present this award."

675
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,430
I thought we were all supposed to
accept this together.

676
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:06,530
I'm so happy to receive this award
on such a meaningful day.

677
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,600
I'd especially like to thank
everyone for their generous...

678
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,140
Oh, gosh.

679
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,790
My dress.

680
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,350
What are you doing?
Why did you come in here?

681
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,750
Because you didn't answer my texts.

682
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,120
Because I didn't answer?

683
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,490
- Go on, get out of here.
- What's wrong? Are you avoiding me?

684
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,960
You won't even look at me.

685
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,630
No, it's not that.
It's just a complicated situation.

686
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,330
So what is
this "complicated situation?"

687
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,100
Come on, seriously.

688
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,870
What's wrong with your face?

689
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,310
Gosh. My nose just started bleeding.

690
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,910
Seriously.

691
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,610
Serves you right.

692
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,710
What?

693
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,150
I'm just saying,

694
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,650
you did me wrong.

695
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,390
So now you're being punished.

696
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,740
What did I do that was so wrong?

697
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,410
You don't think it was?

698
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,280
Toying with someone's emotions
like that?

699
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,410
What are you talking about?

700
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,510
But it's true.

701
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,080
You have me tied up in knots.

702
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,390
Can't you tell
just by looking at me?

703
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,430
Unbelievable. Is he for real?

704
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,470
Playing with my heart like this?

705
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Did you guys see Da Hee
sitting at the CEO's table?

706
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,780
- I'm so jealous.
- Tell me about it.

707
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:31,110
- Whatever. Let's just chill here.
- Sounds good.

708
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,050
- This is uncomfortable.
- Isn't this Da Hae's seat?

709
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,980
Where did she go?
She was originally at Table One.

710
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,080
She switched earlier.
I saw her go somewhere else.

711
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,390
But hey, did you guys see
Da Hae today?

712
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,260
She came all dolled up, didn't she?

713
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,960
Seeing her sitting there with Da Hee
was kind of funny, you know?

714
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,000
Da Hae was in that white dress...

715
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,500
and sitting next to Da Hee.
She was kind of like...

716
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,370
the shredded radish they put
under sashimi.

717
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,500
- What? Like hors d'oeuvre?
- Ji Won, "hors d'oeuvre?"

718
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,040
A side dish. Let's stick to English.

719
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,910
Right.

720
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,410
What was that?
Did you see that move?

721
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,850
Yes, something definitely moved.

722
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,310
Gosh, that scared me!

723
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,750
What is this?

724
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,250
- Gosh!
- What?

725
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,250
What?

726
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,050
- Is someone in there?
- Someone's in there?

727
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,960
- Someone's in there?
- Lift the table.

728
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,960
That...

729
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,830
- What now?
- Just turn.

730
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,570
- Turn? What do you mean, turn?
- What's happening?

731
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,900
- Turn now.
- Gosh.

732
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,940
You're making my head spin.
What do I do?

733
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,500
- Go straight!
- Straight?

734
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,170
- What's that?
- What's that?

735
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,610
What do I do? Where do I go?

736
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,180
- Turn left.
- Left? Turn left.

737
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,710
Do I keep going?

738
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,320
- Get out of the way!
- Hold on.

739
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,820
Stop!

740
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,530
I hit something.
I think it was a person.

741
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,190
Where's the door?

742
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,530
There it is! I see light!
It's over there!

743
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,600
- Run!
- Run!

744
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,630
Wait, what's that? Get down!

745
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Get down!

746
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,740
Down again!

747
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
- Where do we go?
- Over there. The emergency exit!

748
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,660
The emergency exit!

749
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,330
- Da Hae, we're almost there!
- Darn it.

750
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,370
We just have to get past this.
Hang in there.

751
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,770
Gosh, he and I
have terrible teamwork.

752
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,840
Ms. Round?

753
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,540
What? Mr. Ko.

754
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,910
What do you think you're doing here,
Ms. Round?

755
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,640
It's kind of a long story.

756
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,480
Why aren't you answering
Mr. Kim's calls from the factory?

757
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,550
He said he's called you
over 20 times.

758
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,150
What?

759
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,050
I didn't get any calls.

760
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,450
- But what's the problem?
- "What's the problem?"

761
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,060
A hundred boxes were misdelivered.
That's "the problem."

762
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,320
What address did you give
to the delivery company?

763
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,390
Sorry?

764
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,430
Da Hee was the one who contacted
the delivery company...

765
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,500
Da Hee is one of the award winners.

766
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,600
She's busy schmoozing with the CEO.

767
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,330
Of course, you're doing a great job.

768
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,770
I travel so much for work, so...

769
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,070
(Hajin Delivery, Missed Call,
21 More Notifications)

770
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,880
Shouldn't you have handled it,
Ms. Round?

771
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,680
The kids and their guardians
are here. What will you do about it?

772
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,750
I'm also...

773
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
The award...

774
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,520
Seriously.

775
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,350
I'm sorry.

776
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,220
Unbelievable.

777
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,920
How do we fix this?

778
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,800
Our next award is
for the Achievement Award.

779
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,100
Hey.

780
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,770
Are you okay?

781
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,310
I guess.

782
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,650
Aside from being
a little embarrassed, I'm okay.

783
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,480
It's actually kind of funny.

784
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,290
I mean, I just totally got
humiliated, right?

785
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,920
It's not that funny.

786
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,690
Why not? It is!

787
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,900
I think it's funny.

788
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
That's right.

789
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,210
To be honest,
I don't think it's funny either.

790
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Can't I...

791
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,210
just laugh it off?

792
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,120
You don't think I got all dolled up
in this fancy dress...

793
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
just to be humiliated like this,
do you?

794
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,320
I was hoping for my own big moment,
you know?

795
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,860
But it turns out
that was just me being greedy,

796
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,990
and that everyone could see
right through me.

797
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Seriously,

798
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,870
I'm so embarrassed
that I could just die.

799
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,370
So I'm just trying to laugh it off,
but you can't take a hint, can you?

800
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,840
What were you hoping for?

801
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,240
Sorry?

802
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,910
You said you were waiting
for your big moment.

803
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,810
What was it supposed to be?

804
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,250
Did you...

805
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,650
want to be the star of the ceremony
or something?

806
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,390
Looks like I hit the nail
on the head.

807
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,190
Now that's a little funny.

808
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,630
- What are you talking...
- I think you're totally wrong.

809
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,430
I mean, think about it.

810
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,240
Does wearing a fancy dress
make you the star?

811
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,670
You have to do something amazing
to be the star.

812
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,540
But when it comes down to it,

813
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,040
you haven't done anything yet,
have you?

814
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,080
So what's there to be
embarrassed about?

815
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,050
What can I...

816
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,150
- possibly do?
- Anything.

817
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,720
- You pick a fight so easily.
- I'm done trying harder!

818
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,990
You're the type to flip a table
and run for it if you had to.

819
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,030
- Lift the table.
- What?

820
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,470
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

821
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,300
The way I see it,

822
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,540
you're the type who can turn
any place into your own stage.

823
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,040
At that moment, it hit me.

824
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,940
Sweetie, over here!

825
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,150
Right here!

826
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,050
Da Hae.

827
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,920
Mom! When did you get here?

828
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,790
- Did you see me?
- Of course I did.

829
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,090
How'd you even see me?

830
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,260
I was all the way
in the corner of the stage.

831
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,330
All I could see was my daughter.

832
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,740
You're always the brightest star,
wherever you are.

833
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,140
- Really?
- Yes.

834
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,640
Actually,
I wasn't just standing there.

835
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,080
I was doing a bit of acting.

836
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,940
A branch, trembling in the wind.

837
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,380
Do you want to see?

838
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,580
Shiver! What do you think?
I'm pretty good, right?

839
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,720
You're the best!

840
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,220
No matter where I am,

841
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,990
no matter what I wear,
I can be magnificent.

842
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,060
I'm someone who can't be
defined by a mere dress.

843
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,800
Someone who can do
absolutely anything.

844
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,970
Even earlier, I thought we were
doing a lion mask dance.

845
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,340
Seriously, our performance was
Intangible Cultural Heritage-level.

846
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,670
- The restaurant.
- What?

847
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:08,340
- Where's the restaurant?
- It's on B1.

848
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
Please help me.

849
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,380
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

850
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,620
Please stop by.

851
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,050
It hurts.

852
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,360
Hey kids, that hurts. Stop it.

853
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,130
- Hello?
- Do one part-time job for me.

854
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,430
Yes, that's my dream.
To only have one part-time job.

855
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,500
I have to go wait tables now.

856
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:36,240
I wonder when I'll ever be able
to realize my musical vision.

857
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,770
That vision? This kids' president
will make it happen for you.

858
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,340
- Get over here.
- What?

859
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,610
(Enderion)

860
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,780
You want us not to tell Ji Song...

861
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,520
we moved the restaurant
for our team dinner?

862
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,950
It's her regular spot anyway.

863
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,320
We can go with her another time.

864
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,360
But still,
that seems a little harsh.

865
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,930
She tried hard
to get that reservation...

866
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,300
since we all wanted to go there.

867
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,430
And she seemed genuinely happy
to be invited to the group chat.

868
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,000
Can you get off the phone already?

869
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,440
What do you have so much
to talk about?

870
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,870
Just a second.

871
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,540
Our team is in the middle of
a very important conversation.

872
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,880
She's always posting memes in chat
and never misses a chance to say hi.

873
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,110
She's just walking on eggshells.
She knows she's the odd one out.

874
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,680
She knows she doesn't fit in.

875
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,450
I don't get why
we added Kim Ji Song...

876
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,520
to the group chat
in the first place.

877
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,720
We only got the team incentive
because of our hard work, right?

878
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,430
She's just an office operator.
As if she did anything.

879
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,260
You've got a point there.

880
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,810
What do you think you're doing?

881
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,280
My bad.

882
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,780
- Darn it.
- Oh, no.

883
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,290
Kang Eun Sang, you're so pathetic.

884
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,890
When you didn't even know anything,

885
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,390
you went and lectured her
like you knew better.

886
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,300
Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

887
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,370
Wei Lin! Guess where I am right now?

888
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:21,980
Ta-da!

889
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,880
I'm at my team dinner!

890
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,520
Lucky you, honey.
That place is gorgeous.

891
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,720
But not as pretty as you, Ji Song.

892
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,020
Beautiful!

893
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,320
Hang on a second!

895
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,660
(Can I call you back later?)

896
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,430
Honey, we should come here together
when you're in Korea.

897
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,460
This place is so beautiful.

898
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,570
All right, kids!

899
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,270
I am so sorry.

900

to give you,

901
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,180
Dondonchip, the pork cutlet flavor.

902
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,920
Unfortunately, because of
a problem on our end,

903
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:05,450
we can't...

904
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,850
give them out today.

905

00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,160
That's Dr. Ham.

910
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,190
Dr. Ham, what's going on?

911
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,900

928
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,700
He's actually pretty good.

929
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,270
I think my kid listens to this song
on YouTube.

930
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,870
That's right. So does my nephew.

931
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,100
- Right?
- Yes.

932
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,610
- This song was in my algorithm too.
- Really?

933
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,210
Gosh, the kids really love this.
They're all singing along.

That's awesome!

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,470
Dr. Ham, you're the best!

941
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:45,250
One more song!
Come on, sing another one!

942
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,360
Gosh.

943
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,770
If the pork cutlet snacks won't do,
we'll have to serve the real thing.

944
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,670
Thirty pork cutlet specials,
coming through!

945
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,380
That looks delicious.

946
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,280
You're amazing!
How did you even think of this?

947
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,850
Is there anything you can't do?

948
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,090
What a relief.

949
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,620
Thank you so much, Da Hae.

950
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,260
If it weren't for you, our team
would've been in huge trouble.

951
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,860
You saved our necks.

952
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,800
We just got lucky
with the cafeteria menu.

953
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,370
They just happened
to be serving pork cutlets.

954
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,340
The side dish was
just excellent today.

955
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:48,810
Right?

956
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:55,180
I guess that's the power
of social media.

957
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,850
I was so surprised.
Did you see them all singing along?

958
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,350
It felt like a Bruno Mars concert.

959
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,150
The Bruno Mars of preschoolers.

961
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,290

Anyway...

00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:26,810
Excuse me, ma'am.

It's obvious what's happening.

975

- This looks so good.

After thinking about it,
since we all have our own lives,

988
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,170
a group chat seemed unnecessary.

we can just text each other.

- Oh, come on.

People can rave about
Western food all they want,

1019

Seriously, why are you so obsessed
with these team dinners?

It's just a meal
with your coworkers.

enemies or anything.

so I thought...

1032
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,680
they felt the same way.

1040
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,010
- Okay.
- Eat up.

00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,610
Gosh, I had no idea.

1042
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,850
When Da Hae and I were
talking about being off-cycle hires,

1043
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,920
she must have been dying inside.

1044
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,820
So...

1045
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,790
So, O.O...

1046
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,490
O, what?

1047
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,760
Oh, where on your face do you think
you should get work done?

1048
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,600
I'm pretty enough as I am.

1049
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:18,370
What's up with you?
What is it you're trying to say?

1050
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,410
I'm trying to say, O.O...

1051
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,810
Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market
is seeing a remarkable surge.

1052
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,880
Various cryptocurrencies are posting
huge gains day after day,

1053
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,750
grabbing the attention of investors.

1054
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,190
Enderion in particular is surging.

1055
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,060
Let's take a look at today's chart.

1056
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,060
(Enderion price trend)

1057
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,200
(Enderion, 800 dollars)

1058
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,170
It's skyrocketing!

1059
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,580
After my first album failed,
I got a job right away.

1060
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,080
I decided to quit music for good.

1061
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:05,120
I sold my guitar and bought
a pair of dress shoes back then,

1062
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,090
and it felt like...

1063
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,860
I was stepping on a pebble
in those shoes.

1064
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,690
It just kept rolling around,
getting under my foot.

1065
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,730
To me, that pebble
was just like my music.

1066
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,430
It was definitely hurting me,

1067
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,970
but I didn't have the guts
to take it out.

1068
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,110
But I also didn't have the guts
to just shake it out of my shoe.

1069
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:30,110
I walked on
with a pebble in my shoe,

1070
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,480
and that's how I got to where I am.

1071
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,080
That dress of yours...

1072
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,190
is just like these shoes to me.

1073
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,550
They're expensive and nice,

1074
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,590
but wearing them
doesn't make me a star.

1075
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,730
Because I'm still not
where I truly want to be,

1076
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,660
doing what I truly want to do.

1077
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,610
So...

1078
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,580
how expensive were those shoes?
Were they designer?

1079
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,880
Is that all you got from my story?
That the shoes were expensive?

1080
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,120
For me,

1081
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:17,790
I'd still love...

1082
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,930
to have things like that,
at least once.

1083
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,360
The kind of dress Song Hye Kyo wore.

1084
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,900
The kind of car Jun Ji Hyun drives.

1085
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,670
And the apartment
Kim Tae Hee lives in.

1086
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,540
I get that the real stars are...

1087
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,940
amazing without all that stuff...

1088
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,480
in my head,

1089
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,180
but my heart just isn't there yet.

1090
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:43,820
You're so materialistic.

1091
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,990
Oh, gosh. Was it that obvious?

1092
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,420
I'll have to take you somewhere
really expensive next time.

1093
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,390
There's a next time?

1094
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,960
What, so there's no next time?
What's up with that?

1095
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,360
Are you a punk?

1096
00:58:58,530 --> 00:58:59,600
We should get going now.

1097
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,630
Already?
Come on, let's stay a little longer.

1098
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,170
Hey, listen. Let's at least
grab coffee over there.

1099
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,110
But I'm about to miss my last train.

1100
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,010
But it'll be fine
if you walk me to the station.

1101
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:19,550
In that case,
I'll run with you to the station.

1102
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,790
I run 100m in 12 seconds.
I'm crazy fast.

1103
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,900
Sometimes you're so great,
but then at times like this...

1104
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,030
But then what?

1105
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,460
You're a total bust.

1106
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,300
A bust? What are you talking about?

1107
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,640
Gosh, hold on a second.

1108
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:39,970
Just a second.

1109
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,680
What's going on?
You've been acting weird.

1110
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,680
Does something hurt?

1111
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,950
No, I think there's something
in my shoe.

1112
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,380
Again? In such expensive shoes.

1113
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,850
I got a call. Shake that out.

1114
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:58,790
- Hello?
- It's skyrocketing!

1115
00:59:58,790 --> 00:59:59,790
Gosh, you scared me!

1116
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,800
- Da Hae! It's skyrocketing!
- What?

1117
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,100
Wait. Just a second. Hang up.

1118
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:08,770
(Enderion, 800 dollars)

1119
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,570
No way!

1120
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,610
See? This is why.

1121
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,580
What?

1122
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,810
I endured it, fearing you'd run off.

1123
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,310
Because I wanted to keep walking
with you.

1124
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,250
Dr. Ham.

1125
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,990
But why me?

1126
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:02,890
Why do you think?

1127
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,060
Why do you think
I'm acting this way?

1128
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:09,960
Da Hae.

1129
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,410
The pebble from Dr. Ham's shoe...

1130
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,940
must've rolled right into my heart.

1131
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,210
Isn't a rolling pebble's sound
supposed to be a clatter?

1132
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,520
So why do I keep hearing "thump?"

1133
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:53,540
No. It's because my crypto price
went up.

1134
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,340
It's all because of the crypto.

1135
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:08,890
(Epilogue)

1136
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,730
Do the team members
ever eat together?

1137
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,270
What do you guys usually get?

1138
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,000
Is pork cutlet a bad idea?

1139
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:29,680
We love pork cutlets.
We all go out for them for lunch.

1140
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,740
You do?

1141
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,080
Then Namsan
would be the perfect spot.

1142
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:36,150
But it's probably too far
to go for lunch.

1143
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:40,720
Does someone need to
like pork cutlets?

1144
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,160
Is it...

1145
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:46,330
Ms. Round?

1146
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:48,430
Ms. Round?

1147
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,330
Oh, it's Da Hae's nickname.

1148
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:53,330
It's like a pet name, you know.

1149
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:56,270
Jung Da Hae's nickname
is "Round?" Why?

1150
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,040
Is it because she's round?
That's hilarious.

1151
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:04,410
But she doesn't seem
to be the round type.

1152
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,710
And neither is her personality.

1153
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:09,780
And when she gets mad,
she could kill you with a glance.

1154
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,220
That's the kind of look she has.

1155
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,590
But what do I know?

1156
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,300
- What's with him?
- So, any other nicknames?

1157
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,930
Hey, that expression is perfect.

1158
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,400
- Hey, get the shot! Quick!
- No, not really.

1159
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,140
That expression right there
is pure company loyalty.

1160
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,170
But...

1161
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:34,970
Director, I don't think it's
the company he's in love with.

1162
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:45,420
(To the Moon)

1163
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,270
(Special thanks to Zhang Hao
for his cameo)

1164
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,240
With the Averages...

1165
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,710
Put your hands up!

1166
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,080
We came here to splurge for once.

1167
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,150
A little splurge like this
won't hurt once in a while.

1168
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,990
- Hey, not bad.
- Get into crypto.

1169
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,690
No more crypto talk,
or I'm going home.

1170
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,760
Hand over your phone.

1171
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,160
I'll just hold onto it
until tonight.

1172
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,690
- Hey, it's not in here.
- What?

1173
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:27,660
This is exactly why you shouldn't have
collected all our phones!

1174
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:29,500
What do you think you're doing?

1175
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,160
What if it tanks and we can't check?

1176
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:32,930
Are you trying
to completely ruin our trip?

1177
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,730
Help me.

1178
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,640
Da Hae!

1179
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:42,780
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
