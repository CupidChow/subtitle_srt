We hit the jackpot!

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,010
- Our crypto's up! It's really up!
- Look at this.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,010
Really?

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,380
I'm quitting my job.
I'm just done with this place.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,550
What?

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,960
Hold on, what?

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,860
Dear deities,

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,500
why is my heart pounding right now?

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,930
Is it because my crypto dream
is finally coming true?

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,110
Or is it because he's about to quit
and give up a jackpot of a bonus,

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,370
all for some unrealistic
dream of his?

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,950
Dear deities,

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,620
please, just give me an answer.

(Kang Eun Sang Store,

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,990
(Episode 11: Out Into the World)

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,570
Why the long face?
I thought your crypto went up.

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,930
That's the thing.

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,040
When I think about the crypto,
my heart...

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,010
begins pounding,

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,740
but when I think of you, Dr. Ham,
I get all twisted up inside.

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,510
Come on, just accept
the situation, okay?

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,980
Once they accept my resignation,
it's done.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,590
- But they haven't accepted it yet.
- Look, where did we just come from?

28
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,920
We just went to get that, didn't we?

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,860
To actually find the guitar I sold
when I quit music...

30
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,200
at a secondhand market...

31
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,960
as I restart music is totally...

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,170
- A total coincidence.
- It's fate.

33
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,670
I finally feel like
I'm on solid ground.

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,910
It feels like I've finally shaken
the rock out of my shoe.

35
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,140
Now all I have to do is quit.

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,180
They haven't accepted it yet.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,610
Look, about that...

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
What?

39
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,420
- What's wrong with this thing?
- What's going on?

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,790
Why did we stop?

41
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,590
It won't even start.

42
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
What?

43
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,330
I guess this is what
needs fixing now.

44
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,700
Okay, and what time did you say
you'd be here?

45
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,940
Okay. Yes, take your time.
No rush at all.

46
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,440
Okay, thank you.

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,010
Okay.

48
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,680
What'd they say?
Are they on their way?

49
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,590
They said it'd be about an hour.

50
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,920
I see.

51
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,660
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

52
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,830
I was feeling a little cooped up,
so it's nice to get some fresh air.

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Cooped up? Why?
Is it your gastritis again?

54
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,270
- What about your medicine?
- Once before bed.

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,000
But I doze off and keep forgetting,
so it's not getting any better.

56
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,170
- Why do you keep forgetting...
- Hey, you know what?

57
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,970
I think something's wrong
with this guitar.

58
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,180
It sounds a little weird. Listen.

59
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,450
Oh my.
A divine sign you shouldn't quit?

60
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,020
"Oh my," or is that just the sound
of an out-of-tune guitar?

61
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,930
Give it here.

62
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,380
This view...

63
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,650
is suddenly making me want to sing.

64
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,130
<i>On the long roads I have traveled</i>

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,670
<i>My weary heart</i>

66
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,370
<i>Searches for a place of rest</i>

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,710
<i>Letting out a sigh</i>

68
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,380
<i>On a lonely, foreign night</i>

69
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,620
<i>Like a tender greeting</i>

70
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,190
<i>Is the one I still long for</i>

71
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,800
<i>- With you, all right</i>
<i>- With you, all right</i>

72
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,300
<i>- You make me feel all right</i>
<i>- You make me feel all right</i>

73
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,670
<i>- Oh, my darling, my love</i>
<i>- Oh, my darling, my love</i>

74
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,410
<i>- Even if the world stops</i>
<i>- Even if the world stops</i>

75
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,980
<i>- Always</i>
<i>- Always</i>

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,050
<i>- I won't let go of your hand now</i>
<i>- I won't let go of your hand now</i>

77
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,860
<i>Be with you</i>

78
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,410
What's with the look?

79
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,020
- Was it that bad?
- It was amazing.

80
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,690
It's so frustrating.

81
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,890
I don't get it. If it was amazing,
why is that frustrating?

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,890
At a time like this,
I wish you weren't so amazing.

83
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,400
If you weren't so amazing,

84
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,960
I wouldn't be this worried.

85
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,030
Why? Are you worried about me?

86
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,670
How could I not be?

87
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,670
Do you really have to go to England?

88
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
You don't...

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
want me to go?

90
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,450
Should I give up on music again?

91
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,850
No, of course you have to.

92
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,790
So many more people...

93
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,720
need to hear your music.

94
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,630
When you get on stage,
sing every track from one to 11.

95
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,230
And make sure you sing number two.

96
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,370
But do you really have to go as far
as quitting your job?

97
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Just think about it.

98
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,140
You're leaving someone...

99
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,680
as beautiful as me...

100
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,980
behind.

101
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,380
Can you really do that?

102
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,560
I mean,
of course, I know this act...

103
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,730
doesn't work on you, but...

104
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm telling you, it is.

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,770
But who said anything
about leaving you behind?

106
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,510
What?

107
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,350
Well...

108
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,330
- Why are you laughing?
- No, it's just...

109
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,360
The whole vibe just feels like
you're about to propose.

110
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,700
If that was actually the plan,
then you...

111
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,210
- just made it awkward.
- Come on. No way.

112
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,640
There's no ring or flowers.

113
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,850
If it's going to be a proposal,
you need to have all that, right?

114
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,080
And getting down on one knee...

115
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,150
Wait, were you about to get down
on one knee?

116
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,930
You completely ruined the surprise,

117
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,990
but I guess I still have to do it.

118
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,840
- You have flowers too?
- I guess...

119
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,240
I'd need those too, right?

120
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,220
Wait, don't tell me...

121
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,860
you're going to give me a ring too?

122
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,330
You keep spoiling everything,

123
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,930
but I guess I have to give you one.

124
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,110
Are you really going to say it?

125
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,310
I love you.

126
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Will you...

127
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,220
marry me?

128
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,660
Kim Ji Song.

129
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,430
- Yes?
- Why are these client codes old?

130
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,670
They all changed last week.

131
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,270
What? But...

132
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,370
Nobody told me anything about that.

133
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,540
What are you talking about?
I had Mr. Yoon tell you on Friday.

134
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Right, Mr. Yoon?

135
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,850
What? Me?

136
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,720
Mr. Yoon was out all last week...

137
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,780
What?
So you're saying it's my fault?

138
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,620
- No. That's not it.
- Give me a break.

139
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,720
If I ask you to do one thing,
just do it right. Please.

140
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,960
Are you slacking off,
or is it because you're an O.O?

141
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,200
- Just go.
- Yes.

142
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,730
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,580
Make me a cup of green tea
before you go.

144
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,980
Okay.

145
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,620
If he's calling me a slacker "O.O,"

146
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,720
does that make him a
psycho pervert or something?

147
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,360
I can't stand him.
Seriously. Darn it.

148
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
(A business owner earns
100,000 dollars after quitting job.)

149
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,950
What?

150
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,650
Hee Jung?

151
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,520
(Q. Why did you start
your own business?)

152
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,150
I used to be a product researcher
at another company.

153
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,060
I was an O.O there...
No, I was on a permanent contract.

154
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,700
So, no one really believed in me,
and I had no mentor to guide me.

155
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,830
That's when it hit me.

156
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,640
"I'm the one who has to build
my own future."

157
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,340
And with that, I decided to jump
into the world of startups.

158
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,680
(Any words for aspiring
entrepreneurs?)

159
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,080
Don't torture yourself.

160
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,510
What?

161
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,050
Instead of agonizing
over unanswerable questions,

162
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,820
just get started now,
whatever it is.

163
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,890
Life is just too short
to waste away...

164
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,730
in a place where you're not valued.

165
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,900
Right.

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,300
Life is short.

167
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,040
And I really hate my job.

168
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,710
Congratulations.

169
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,580
Da Hee, congratulations.
Are you now Ms. Jung?

170
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,620
I'm just up for a promotion review.
It's not a done deal yet.

171
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,990
Come on, who else would get it
but you, Da Hee?

172
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,220
Exactly. You did well with Cocomishu
and the snack subscription.

173
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,320
- That's enough of that.
- Why?

174
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,660
Hey, Da Hee,
you should treat us today.

175
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,130
Okay. In that case,
lunch is on me today.

176
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,470
- Let's all go...
- Da Hae.

177
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,230
You're here?

178
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,170
Da Hae, I'm hungry. Come on.

179
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,670
- Gosh, hurry up.
- Aren't you going to eat with us?

180
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,810
Never mind.
Let's just go eat like this.

181
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,180
- Let's just go.
- Should we?

182
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,980
- Yes.
- Let's get going.

183
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,190
What, do they think I'm
some kind of saint?

184
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,520
Did they expect me to just join them
for lunch and congratulate her?

185
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,300
That snack subscription service
was my idea, you know?

186
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,530
Come on, they said it was
because Cocomishu did well.

187
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,930
It had nothing to do with your idea.

188
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,940
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm just saying, don't be mad.

189
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,940
Is work worth getting so upset over?

190
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,670
The crypto charts are going nuts,

191
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,310
and you just got
a marriage proposal.

192
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,210
You can quit this job
anytime you want...

193
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,280
I haven't given him an answer yet.

194
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,190
- What?
- It was all so sudden,

195
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,360
- so I asked him for some time.
- I see.

196
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,460
Right,
and don't trust that crypto chart.

197
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,030
You never know when it'll tank.

198
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,030
What?

199
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,700
Why?
Do you think it will drop again?

200
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,070
Not necessarily,

201
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,440
but there's talk
of crypto regulation,

202
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,970
and rumors of alternative
crypto currencies being delisted.

203
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,210
Before it starts affecting us,

204
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,780
I think it might be a good idea
to just exit our position.

205
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,680
What, you want to pull out
when it's doing so well?

206
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,680
You're right.
We should play it safe.

207
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,950
Right.

208
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,120
Knowing the right time to pull out
is the most crucial part of it.

209
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,230
Otherwise, when you're complacent,
you'll get blindsided.

210
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,400
Bam...

211
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,070
And I was the one who just got hit.

212
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,940
What is this?

213
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,670
What is this?

214
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,140
A disciplinary hearing?

215
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,380
Nothing has been officially
decided yet.

216
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,010
It's a heads-up that
there might be a hearing...

217
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,010
because of the Kang Eun Sang Store.

218
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,150
What about the Kang Eun Sang Store?

219
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,950
Why would I be disciplined
over that?

220
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,620
Company policy says for-profit activity
is grounds for discipline.

221
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,490
The company's just been looking
the other way until now.

222
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,360
As a loyal customer
of the Kang Eun Sang Store,

223
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,130
I find this situation unfortunate.

224
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,270
Please prepare yourself,
just in case.

225
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,540
If it just hadn't been
for that post.

226
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,940
A post? What post?

227
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,740
Not Hoppang Bite again.

228
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,310
What do you guys think
about the Kang Eun Sang Store?

229
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,710
Running a business here isn't right.

230
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,050
I got food poisoning from her drink.
I thought I was going to die.

231
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,220
I think she resells expired stuff.

232
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,550
The quality's crap,
and her prices are crazy.

233
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,790
- We should make this known, right?
- Darn it, seriously...

234
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,020
Come on.
Like I'd ever sell anything expired.

235
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,530
What are we going to do?
I just overheard...

236
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,530
that if you got disciplined,

237
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,800
you could be suspended
for a month without pay.

238
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,670
Get Grandma Na Moon Hee.

239
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,470
She has to give this post
a piece of her mind.

240
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
A hundred times over.

241
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,610
But a month should be okay, right?
Besides, your crypto is way up.

242
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,440
Hey, you can't compare the two.

243
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,450
You absolutely need a steady income,
like a salary.

244
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Then what are we supposed to do?

245
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,580
Ms. Eun Sang! There you are.

246
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,220
Hey, can I get two cup noodles
and two pain relief patches, please?

247
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,690
We're closed today.

248
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,960
I get it.
I won't ask to put it on my tab.

249
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,130
- Wait, you're serious?
- Yes, there's a bit of a situation.

250
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,500
Ms. Eun Sang, can I get stockings?
In tan.

251
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,670
About that...

252
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,670
You wouldn't have a hangover drink?

253
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,140
I drank way too much yesterday.

254
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,410
Is the Kang Eun Sang Store
closed today?

255
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,910
Excuse me, everyone.

256
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,810
Kang Eun Sang Store is
temporarily closed.

257
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,910
No, we can't do business.

258
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,950
But your products
are all right here.

259
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,050
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,550
I'll pay you ten dollars right now.

261
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,120
- I'll pay you cash this time.
- I'm sorry.

262
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,950
- Please...
- I can't believe this...

263
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,790
Da Hae, talk to her at least.

264
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,990
- I have to go to a store now.
- Let's go.

265
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,830
Wait, this is it.

266
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,060
- What?
- What?

267
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,470
Look, many people need
the Kang Eun Sang Store.

268
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,100
All of these people.

269
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,500
And?

270
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,270
One time, we had a huge meeting,
and we were all out of coffee.

271
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,540
I'm telling you,
if it wasn't for Kang Eun Sang Store,

272
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,780
we would've had to hold that meeting
without a single cup of coffee.

273
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,780
They make us work overtime,
but we still have to be here early.

274
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,020
And on top of that, they don't even
stock shampoo in the staff lounge.

275
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,090
It's thanks to the shampoo
and razors Ms. Eun Sang sells...

276
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,090
that I can even show up to work
without looking like a total slob.

277
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,230
If the Kang Eun Sang Store is gone,

278
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,630
the nearest store is
three intersections away.

279
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,200
In that case, they should at least
give us a longer lunch break.

280
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,900
By the way,

281
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,740
this is completely anonymous, right?

282
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,140
Yes. Don't you worry.
We're just going to compile it...

283
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,840
and use it for the petition.

284
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,780
Just to show how indispensable...

285
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,450
the Kang Eun Sang Store
has been to the staff.

286
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,850
Oh, well, if that's all,
then I don't mind.

287
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,320
- Keep up the fight.
- What?

288
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,030
Everyone will be in a bind
if the Kang Eun Sang Store is gone.

289
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,990
Hang in there.

290
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,830
Thank you.

291
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,130
Here, Da Hae.

292
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
I didn't think anyone
would agree to help.

293
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,510
This still isn't quite enough,
though.

294
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,080
This won't amount to much
on the petition.

295
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,450
Do we really have to do this?

296
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,180
Come on, Mr. Ko.

297
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,450
You'll be the most inconvenienced...

298
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,320
if the Kang Eun Sang Store
disappears.

299
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,390
You're hungover almost every day.

300
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,790
Where will you get
your hangover drinks...

301
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,560
and headache pills?

302
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,090
No, I'm talking about Ms. Eun Sang.

303
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,130
Does she really need to do this?

304
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,900
- What?
- I heard...

305
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,500
she made a fortune in crypto.

306
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,200
How much are we talking?

307
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,140
Why are you so curious about that?
I thought you valued honest work.

308
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,850
I can't keep grinding away forever.

309
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,050
Before they put me out to pasture,
I need to make a killing too...

310
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,950
Are you going to tell me or not?

311
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,420
You won't tell me, will you?

312
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,620
Fine, I'm not doing the interview.

313
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,260
Mr. Ko, wait!

314
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,230
I've already set up the camera.

315
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,090
Come on, you said you'd do it!

316
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,630
Darn it! He's really gone. Shoot.

317
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,370
It's no use.

318
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,500
What do you mean?

319
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,700
The disciplinary hearing
for Kang Eun Sang Store.

320
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,440
It's going to happen no matter what.

321
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,040
I was the one who reported her.

322
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,080
I thought it was Hoppang Bite...

323
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,450
That's me.

324
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,110
What?

325
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,820
I'm Hoppang Bite.

326
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,590
But I figured just posting
on the company board...

327
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,790
wouldn't be enough for a hearing.

328
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,000
So I made a formal report to HR,
and I'm on my way back now.

329
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,430
So Ms. Eun Sang will probably
be hearing from them soon.

330
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,100
Wait. No, hold on a second.

331
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,300
What are you talking...

332
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,910
You're who?

333
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,680
Hoppang Bite.

334
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
What...

335
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,880
So...

336
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,920
I just don't understand
what you're saying.

337
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,750
I really can't wrap
my head around it.

338
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,920
Will this make it clearer?

339
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,890
(My Posts:
Hoppang Bite, Kang Eun Sang Store)

340
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,460
(I heard someone at our company
made a million dollars in crypto.)

341
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,590
So it really was you...

342
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,760
But why?

343
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,700
And why are you telling me
all this now?

344
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,070
This isn't the right place to talk.

345
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,170
How about we get some coffee...

346
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,570
Are you kidding me right now?

347
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,310
Why did you report
the Kang Eun Sang Store?

348
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,280
If the hearing affects Eun Sang...

349
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,310
Will she get fired?

350
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,020
Probably not.
It'd be nice if she did, though.

351
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,690
What did you say?

352
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,720
Will you keep seeing Dr. Ham?

353
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,730
I'd like it if you two broke up.

354
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,160
If you'd done that sooner,
I wouldn't have gone this far.

355
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,930
Da Hee, don't tell me...

356
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,130
you're doing all this
because you like Dr. Ham?

357
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,640
I guess that's as far
as your imagination goes.

358
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,310
- How boring.
- Jung Da Hee.

359
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
You must be busy preparing
for the hearing.

360
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,110
I'll be on my way.

361
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,490
Gosh. What was that?
That's so creepy.

362
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,360
Is this some kind of
hidden camera prank?

363
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Hoppang Bite...

364
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,800
(Subject: Disciplinary Hearing
From: Marron HR)

365
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,100
(To: Kang Eun Sang
Attachment: Disciplinary Hearing)

366
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100
(Dear Ms. Kang, this concerns
your commercial activities...)

367
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,540
(and is notice of
a disciplinary hearing.)

368
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,910
But why in the world would
Hoppang Bite target me?

369
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,510
Trolls don't exactly pick and choose
their targets, you know.

370
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,750
I have a feeling they did pick
their target this time.

371
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
What?

372
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,420
About Hoppang Bite...

373
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,420
What?

374
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,600
Nevermind.

375
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,060
It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

376
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,330
What is it?

377
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Eun Sang,

378
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,500
we're not going to let this
beat us, okay?

379
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,210
That hearing? Let's go in there
and completely crush it.

380
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,210
That's right.

381
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,340
So on that note...

382
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,380
Let's start with a practice run.

383
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,820
What?

384
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,320
Ms. Kang Eun Sang,

385
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,260
why, exactly, were you selling
products at work?

386
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,260
That's because...

387
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,060
You were blinded by your greed!

388
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,530
What? Hey.

389
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,900
Are you laughing?
Do you find this amusing?

390
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,270
You're in front of a
disciplinary committee!

391
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,170
"You?" You two are something else.

392
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,270
Hey.

393
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,710
Stop slouching...

394
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,940
and address
the committee with respect.

395
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,280
Honorable members of the committee,

396
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,120
could you please tone it down?

397
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,990
Eun Sang,
the real hearing will be much worse.

398
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,150
That's why we have to
practice properly.

399
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,260
Exactly. "One month of unpaid leave"
is just code.

400
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,260
If things go south
and you actually get fired...

401
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,360
I apologize.

402
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,370
I...

403
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,540
in this hallowed company,

404
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,940
committed the profane commercial act
known as Kang Eun Sang Store.

405
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,840
I am truly sorry.

406
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,320
But to me, this company is
more than just a job.

407
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,690
It was my life,

408
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,820
my dream,

409
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,420
and it was my last link
to the outside world.

410
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,800
I tarnished that
noble company culture...

411
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,700
and sullied it with my own greed.

412
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,130
Never again...

413
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,110
Never will I act so foolishly again.

414
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,410
I beg you,

415
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,950
please forgive me just this once.

416
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,720
Best Actress?

417
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,930
I think she's already
won one of those.

418
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,930
Was it convincing?

419
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,070
Why don't you play
the boyfriend card?

420
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,770
The boyfriend card?

421
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,780
You know, Dr. Ham.

422
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,010
He did resign,
but it hasn't been processed yet.

423
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,510
He should still have
some pull, right?

424
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,380
Want me to ask him
to stop the action...

425
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,780
against the Kang Eun Sang Store?

426
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,750
Forget it.

427
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,060
He's got enough on his plate
as it is.

428
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,690
Why? What's bothering him?

429
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,430
You.

430
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,960
You still haven't answered
his proposal.

431
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,160
It's not that I haven't
answered him.

432
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,470
I just have a lot on
my mind about it.

433
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,940
Like what? What's on your mind?

434
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,070
Eun Sang.

435
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,280
I was imagining what it'd be like
if I went to England with Dr. Ham.

436
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,780
- But...
- But what? You don't like it?

437
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,290
It was amazing!
No, you have to imagine it too.

438
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,360
We're talking England. Cambridge.

439
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,590
I'd start my days in a brick house
overlooking the River Cam.

440
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,460
I'd relax with some tea
and fish and chips.

441
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,700
Then in the afternoon,
I'd go to London...

442
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,830
for a stroll near Buckingham Palace.

443
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,970
And maybe check out
those handsome Royal Guards.

444
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,740
In the evening, I'd watch the sunset
over the River Thames...

445
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,610
and have a nice glass of wine...

446
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,780
I'd probably get drunk. Right.

447
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,050
I should behave myself
in a foreign country, right?

448
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,790
If you've figured it all out,
why wait?

449
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,020
You sound so happy about it.

450
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,030
I know, right? Why am I hesitating?

451
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,130
Anyway, don't you worry.

452
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,800
Even if you get suspended
or lose pay,

453
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,870
what's the big deal?

454
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,610
- What?
- You've got us.

455
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,680
You think we can't take care of you?

456
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,110
What do you think we make money for?

457
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,850
That's enough.
Ma'am, what's that called again?

458
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,050
We'll get you the VIP package
at a retirement community.

459
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,150
Just trust us.

460
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,750
Are you laughing? Answer me!

461
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,660
- Answer me.
- Hey.

462
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,230
- Answer!
- This is as far as I go.

463
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,890
- Answer!
- Go on. Get going.

464
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,940
- What are you doing?
- Observing.

465
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,170
Observing what?

466
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,250
I saw on TV that
daily life offers startup ideas.

467
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,820
If I look closely at everyday faces,
I might see something new.

468
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,520
You're right.

469
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,690
I do see something new.

470
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
You've got a sunspot.

471
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,090
What? Where?

472
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,760
A startup? Please.
Now that you have a little money,

473
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,100
you're getting all sorts of
wild ideas.

474
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,570
- They are not wild ideas.
- Yes, they are.

475
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,070
Not everyone can start a business,
you know?

476
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,540
If you're just doing this
without doing any real research,

477
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,340
and you just want to be treated
like a CEO, then...

478
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,810
Profit structure, capital, loans,
market analysis, and site selection.

479
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,180
I've researched all of that.
I've also started business training.

480
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,120
I just need to land on an idea.

481
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,660
What?

482
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,060
I don't want to be treated
like a CEO, but like a human being.

483
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,990
But I can't get that at the company.

484
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,500
My future lies outside this company.

485
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,260
(Marron Confectionery)

486
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,500
(Written Statement)

487
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,400
Good morning, Da Hae.

488
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,610
Are you all prepared for
the disciplinary hearing today?

489
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,050
Look. Don't talk to me. It's creepy.

490
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,020
I thought you'd post on the forum
that I'm Hoppang Bite.

491
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,460
But you didn't.

492
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,430
Why not?

493
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,790
Did you think
no one would believe you?

494
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,000
- You should've at least tried.
- I told you not to talk to me.

495
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,300
Aren't you curious why I did it?

496
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,910
I could tell you why.

497
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,250
Want to meet up after the hearing?

498
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,580
- We could grab a coffee.
- Not later.

499
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
Let's talk now.

500
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,850
Follow me.

501
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,960
You crazy psycho!

502
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,790
I swear...

503
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,600
When you only gave me an Americano
and threw away my letter,

504
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,500
and the times you subtly wronged me,
I told myself it wasn't malicious.

505
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,840
But no more benefit of the doubt.

506
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,210
From now on, I'm going to assume
your actions are malicious,

507
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,880
so you'd better watch your back.

508
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,510
If you mess with me one more time,
you'll regret it.

509
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,680
And if you mess with my people,
you'll regret that too.

510
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,890
If something fishy happens
at Eun Sang's hearing today,

511
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,450
you'll regret that too.

512
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,220
I'll punch you
in the face next time,

513
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,920
so you'd better be ready. Got it?

514
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,830
And one more thing.

515
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,830
You're Jung Da Hee,

516
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,600
and I'm Jung Da Hae.

517
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:31,970
We're not the same.

518
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,070
- What?
- Why would I call you Hoppang Bite?

519
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:40,580
Why would I waste my precious time
gossiping about your pathetic life?

520
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,180
You think I'd stoop to your level?

521
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,870
Eun Sang,
you've got this. Don't be nervous.

522
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,940
Okay?

523
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,240
You're shaking more than I am,
you know.

524
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,440
We've got your back no matter what,
so don't worry about it. Okay?

525
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,440
Okay. Maybe you should wipe
your mouth first.

526
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,280
What am I going to do with you guys?

527
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,050
You're with me
right to the very end.

528
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,960
- I'm heading in.
- Okay.

529
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,230
- You've got this!
- You've got this!

530
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
- You can do it!
- Go, Kang Eun Sang!

531
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,070
Don't be nervous.

532
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
You've got this!

533
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,210
This is killing me.

534
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Ms. Kang Eun Sang.

535
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,590
Please explain why you decided
to sell items on company property.

536
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,730
You know,
getting a single office supply...

537
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,800
involves a lot of red tape.

538
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,840
The equipment we're provided
is often broken,

539
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,570
and when you're in a pinch,
there are no other options.

540
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,110
So I personally started keeping...

541
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,810
a small stash of supplies...

542
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,080
Ms. Kang Eun Sang.

543
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,110
This hearing...

544
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,850
is not the place for you
to complain about company benefits.

545
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,720
I hear you also sold expired items.

546
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,790
- No. I've never done that.
- And how can we believe that?

547
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,530
I have records,
and I've kept photos of everything.

548
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,890
Please send the records and photos
at a later time.

549
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,930
- Sounds like quite an operation.
- In any case,

550
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,900
all those items you sold
to your coworkers,

551
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,630
you charged them for it, correct?

552
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,440
There were so many of them,
and such a wide variety of items,

553
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,510
that giving them all away
for free was...

554
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,480
Yes. So you sold them
for money, yes or no?

555
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,190
Yes. I accepted money for them.

556
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,490
- Da Hae.
- What?

557
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Can you hear anything?

558
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,960
No, I can't hear a single thing.

559
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,260
I hope she's holding her own
in there.

560
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,600
You're showing your true colors now.

561
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,570
You did it for money, didn't you?

562
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,640
Do you love money that much?

563
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,300
How could you do that at work,

564
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,740
selling things
to your own coworkers?

565
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,080
Unbelievable.

566
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,210
Colleagues...

567
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,580
Excuse me, but...

568
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,320
what you all call "coworkers,"
what does that word even mean?

569
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,490
What?

570
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,190
Are you saying
when money's involved,

571
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,960
colleagues don't mean a thing
to you?

572
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,130
Yes.

573
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,160
I don't know what...

574
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,400
this company's definition
of a colleague is.

575
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,900
The coworkers I know...

576
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,570
are people with no one to lean on,

577
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,610
who are trying to survive
on their own.

578
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,050
They're the ones who needed my help.

579
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,750
The 14th Open Recruitment hires...

580
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,120
went out to eat together again,
without us.

581
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,590
They may seem like trivial things,
but when they pile up,

582
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,260
the incidents can really make...

583
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,590
- a person feel small.
- Eun Sang.

584
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,600
I was the only one who didn't know
the all-hands meeting was moved.

585
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,100
That kind of thing always happened
to my colleagues with no power.

586
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,070
Just because we're O.Os,

587
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,740
isn't it unfair that
we get no holiday gifts?

588
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,510
I saw and heard it all happening
right in front of me.

589
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,280
It's the employee lounge,
so I just stepped in for a second,

590
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,820
but they told me to get out.

591
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,820
(Heat pack)

592
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,690
How could I possibly
turn a blind eye?

593
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,030
And so,

594
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,400
something I started just to help out
in a small way...

595
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,700
grew into the Kang Eun Sang Store.

596
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,970
Yes, right. So?
What happened after it grew?

597
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,870
You turned the office
into a marketplace.

598
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,080
Yes, you're right.

599
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,850
My intentions aside,

600
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,290
it's true I started a business here,

601
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,560
and as a result,
money did end up changing hands.

602
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,590
Therefore,

603
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,970
(Letter of Resignation)

604
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,170
I am submitting my resignation.

605
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,140
Your resignation?

606
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,340
Are you saying you're quitting?

607
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,540
I have to take responsibility
for my actions.

608
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,780
What? No, you should be begging
for another chance,

609
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,750
and even that might not be enough,
but instead you do this.

610
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,450
Yes. Please be lenient.

611
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,660
I know it's shameless to resign,
but I ask this of you.

612
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,790
Please look after...

613
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,360
my coworkers.

614
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,770
Please ensure my colleagues
are not discriminated against...

615
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and that they can receive
fair treatment.

616
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,810
And that our company and environment
don't hinder their growth.

617
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,480
So that...

618
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,150
the future they dream of
in this company...

619
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,290
doesn't have to feel so bleak.

620
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,260
From now on,
I ask that all of you here...

621
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,730
to please pay closer attention
to them.

622
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,730
Sincerely,

623
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,630
I ask this of you.

624
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,880
Do we really need to continue
with this?

625
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,780
Am I the only one who's embarrassed
right now?

626
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,460
Da Hae, it's over.

627
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,360
Hey, come here!

628
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,100
Eun Sang.

629
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,140
- How did it go?
- Did everything go okay?

630
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,040
I have something to tell you guys.

631
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,110
Thank you.

632
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,120
(Your Beer, Custom Craft Beer)

633
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,220
What do you mean you're quitting?

634
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,350
What are you talking about?

635
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,620
Did something go wrong
at the hearing?

636
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,960
Are those people still giving you
a hard time?

637
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,560
Of course they are.
It's all the company's fault.

638
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,130
Anyway, from A to Z,
it's all the company's fault.

639
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,860
Stop bad-mouthing the company.

640
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,470
Still, for me,
there are things I'm grateful for.

641
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,000
It's how I got to meet you all.

642
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,170
Back then...

643
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,410
I know I pretended
you were all a pain,

644
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,010
but that's not how I really felt.

645
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,400
Come on, hurry up!

646
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,170
The late-night fee will kick in
for taxis! Come on!

647
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,470
- Eun Sang!
- Come on!

648
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,800
- Come on!
- You've got this!

649
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,640
The way you would call out to me...

650
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,570
- Hurry!
- Eun Sang!

651
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,570
- You've got this!
- Eun Sang!

652
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,510
I really liked hearing that.

653
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,920
When life got so hard that I wanted
to throw everything away...

654
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,020
and just wanted to die,

655
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,590
hearing you call for me
gave me strength.

656
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,760
Or maybe I was just
making that my excuse.

657
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,230
For your sakes,

658
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,870
I'd tell myself to just hang on
for one more day.

659
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,600
"Let's live."

660
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,270
"Let's live."

661
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,980
Now that I think about it,
raising you was a great excuse.

662
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,110
Then keep raising us.

663
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,580
- Keep raising us then.
- But looking at you now,

664
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,850
you're all so much more grown up
than I thought.

665
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,390
You don't need
my protection anymore.

666
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,390
So I think it's time...

667
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,230
to finally be liberated
from these parenting trenches.

668
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,900
It's my turn now...

669
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,540
to get out there.

670
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,840
Out into the world.

671
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,740
And keep going, with no limits.

672
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,140
Eun Sang...

673
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,350
I mean, but still...

674
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,180
What's with you?

675
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,820
I'm trying not to cry.

676
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,660
She needs to spread her wings,
but she can't if I cry.

677
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,890
But every time I open my mouth,

678
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,560
I'm afraid I'll just end up
begging her to stay.

679
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,800
So that's why.

680
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,740
Gosh, you're really something else.

681
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,520
I'm not going to cry. I'm not.

682
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,190
Don't you cry.

683
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,200
Don't cry, Eun Sang.

684
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,670
- This is delicious.
- Just eat up.

685
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,200
Gosh, you already bought us dinner.

686
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,170
Should you be buying us drinks too?

687
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,710
- Thank you, Da Hee.
- Don't mention it.

688
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,880
Hey, now that I think about it,
shouldn't Da Hae have come with us?

689
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,850
Come on.
Besides, is Da Hae even in the mood?

690
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,520
She seemed to have high hopes
for this promotion review.

691
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,190
She must be really disappointed.

692
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,020
But Da Hae has been on a roll.

693
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,290
I think she's even better at her job
than we are.

694
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,390
Come on, what good does that do?

695
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,960
In the end,
she is still an off-cycle hire.

696
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,860
She's still just Jung Da Hae.

697
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,670
Our Jung Da Hee and that Jung Da Hae
are completely different.

698
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,170
You're Jung Da Hee,
and I'm Jung Da Hae.

699
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,940
We're not the same.

700
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,440
- How are we any different?
- What did you say?

701
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,740
Pardon?

702
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,380
Have you all decided what to order?

703
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,050
- Yes.
- What?

704
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,120
- I'll go place the order.
- Fried chicken for me.

705
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,350
I'll have the fruit platter.

706
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,290
I'd like to place an order.

707
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,260
- Great work today, everyone.
- See you tomorrow.

708
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,990
Da Hee?

709
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,470
Assistant Manager Lee?
What are you doing here?

710
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,400
I was having a drink
with some people from work.

711
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,070
I thought that might be you,
and I was right.

712
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Yes.

713
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,610
How have you been?

714
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,710
"How have I been?"

715
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
That's rich.

716
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,950
(Marron Confectionery,
Jung Da Hee)

717
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,760
So you left our company
for Marron Confectionery?

718
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Yes.

719
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,400
I know quite a few people there.

720
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,770
I should give them a call.
It's been a while.

721
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,970
I'll be going.

722
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,740
Da Hee, you haven't changed a bit.

723
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,610
Still so cheerful.

724
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,510
It's disgusting.

725
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,640
Ji Song?

726
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,280
What? My popcorn.

727
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,750
Ji Song, wait.

728
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,250
Mr. Oh!

729
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,960
Were you eating all that
by yourself?

730
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,200
No.

731
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,270
I was with my friends just now,

732
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,970
but I wanted to get some fresh air
before heading back.

733
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,110
Where'd you get the popcorn from?

734
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,650
Hee Jung gave it to me.

735
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,620
- Who?
- Hee Jung.

736
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,390
The employee who was on
the R and D team.

737
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,990
I heard she opened a pub nearby,

738
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,690
so that's where I just came from.

739
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,590
Hee Jung. Yes, I heard about that.

740
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,230
That she hit it big
with her craft beer.

741
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,430
So you heard.

742
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,600
But that success of hers...

743
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,970
That could have been me, actually.

744
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
What do you mean?

745
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,810
Customizing beer to your own taste
and all that.

746
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,750
Actually, that was an idea
I had a while ago.

747
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,360
And I have a ton of other
great ideas besides that one.

748
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,830
Right now, people are just
drinking bubble tea,

749
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:21,000
but later, something way sweeter
like brown sugar boba will trend.

750
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,570
Right, and that
"personal color" analysis thing...

751
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,440
The technique that finds the most
flattering colors for a person.

752
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,970
I think that'll be a trend too.
And also...

753
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,740
I'm serious.

754
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,450
Sorry?

755
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,510
I have really good instincts.

756
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,150
Everything I predict
is bound to take off.

757
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,420
Yes, I know.
I'm sure you're right, Ji Song.

758
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,720
What would you know about it,
Mr. Oh?

759
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,530
People I know just think I'm like...

760
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,160
some green tea bag lying around...

761
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,260
in the break room.

762
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,370
A green tea bag?

763
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,340
Because they're cheap.

764
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,000
The kind...

765
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,340
you just buy a bunch of
and stock anywhere.

766
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,410
The green tea bag.

767
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,250
That's exactly how I feel at work.

768
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,380
Taken for granted,

769
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,750
always there...

770
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,430
But nothing special?

771
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,100
Come to think of it,

772
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,200
you really are like a green tea bag.

773
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,510
Hey!

774
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,240
No, I mean, with a tea bag,

775
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,080
you have to let it steep
for a while...

776
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,680
to bring out its deep flavor.

777
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,880
And you, Ji Song,

778
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,490
if people took the time
to really get to know you,

779
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,190
they'd see how special you are.

780
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,760
I guess people just don't
realize that yet.

781
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,030
Really?

782
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,230
Is that what you really think?

783
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,040
So, are you saying that I could...

784
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:15,950
really make it big out there?

785
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,110
Me? Out there?

786
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,020
Really?

787
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Yes.

788
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,300
Really.

789
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,470
I mean it.

790
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,400
What's this?

791
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,940
His eyes are...

792
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,010
like grapes.

793
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,580
Sorry?

794
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,300
(Ham Ji Woo)

795
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,960
Hello?

796
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,500
You sound down.

797
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,100
Is something wrong?

798
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,470
It's nothing.

799
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:16,440
It sounds like something's wrong.
What, is your stomach upset?

800
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,080
You forgot your medicine again,
didn't you?

801
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,280
One thing at a time, please.

802
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,550
Nothing major is wrong.

803
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
My stomach's just, you know, so-so.

804
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,720
I just keep forgetting
to take my medication.

805
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,890
And...

806
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,320
as for the answer
you've been waiting to hear...

807
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,160
I just need a little more time.

808
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,300
Actually, I wasn't that curious
about that one.

809
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,170
So I guess it's not that important
to you?

810
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,400
I was just trying to play it cool.
Guess it didn't work?

811
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,140
Since playing it cool didn't work,
can I just ask?

812
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,580
Why are you dragging this out?

813
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,710
It's just that...

814
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,720
But what would I do in England?

815
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,520
Whatever you want.
I'll support you in whatever you do.

816
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,760
What if I decide I want to be
an astronaut? What then?

817
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:13,830
I'd make it happen.

818
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,270
If I said I wanted
to be president...

819
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,840
What's your ballot number?
Which one am I supposed to check?

820
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:22,910
Please.

821
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:24,570
You're such a good talker.

822
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,010
You always just try to get by
with sweet talk.

823
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,150
Is there something you want?

824
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,920
I mean...

825
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,350
Anyone can promise you
the moon and the stars.

826
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,360
- Next stop, Shingye Station.
- What?

827
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,790
If you really want to score points
with me...

828
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,360
What a woman really wants
on a dark night like this,

829
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,730
is when she gets off the bus...

830
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,840
is for you to be waiting there
at the stop.

831
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,490
Waiting, and then what?

832
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,730
- Something like this?
- What are you doing here?

833
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,700
- To kiss you?
- What?

834
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,130
I just scored some points.
Five points.

835
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,100
No, make that ten points.

836
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,710
Where are you going after all that?
Why are you just leaving?

837
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,210
I was passing by
and just stopped to see you.

838
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,440
Text me as soon as you get home.

839
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,410
And take your medicine.

840
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,950
That man, I swear.

841
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,620
As if I wasn't confused enough,
he has to make my heart flutter.

842
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,060
It seriously makes me want
to quit my job.

843
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,910
Hey. Isn't waiting two hours
for just one kiss...

844
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:05,710
a pretty bad return for your time?

845
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,710
It's worth it.
It could be our last kiss.

846
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,380
Why? You nervous?

847
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,580
- Because she hasn't said yes?
- She will.

848
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,390
She will. I know she will, but...

849
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,990
If there's a one-in-a-million chance
it won't work out between us...

850
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,100
What do you mean, "one chance?"

851
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,030
There's a chance her family says no,
the chance her best friends say no,

852
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,600
the chance your families
are enemies,

853
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,000
the chance you're half-siblings.

854
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,510
What? Do we look like half-siblings?

855
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,540
Does that even seem possible?
Do we look alike?

856
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,440
You're nuts.

857
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,610
Why would you scare me like that?

858
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,550
Anyway, out of all those,
the most likely one is...

859
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,590
that my mom will be against it.

860
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,590
The reason I'm here today is...

861
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,990
that I have something
I must tell you.

862
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,530
Are you listening?

863
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,070
I'll just assume you are and say it.

864
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,130
As a musician,

865
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,500
I want a new beginning.

866
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,870
Also, I'm going to marry who I love.

867
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,070
Marriage...

868
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,810
I'm going to do it.
I know you may be against it, Mom.

869
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,610
But you know, that possibility...

870
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,050
That possibility is
a part of me, too.

871
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,220
Or at least it was.

872
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,750
It still is.

873
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,690
I could have given up on music
and lived a miserable life.

874
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,430
But she brought me back to life.

875
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,990
She told me to try again.

876
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,060
To dream again.
How could I let someone like her go?

877
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,030
I'm not a fool.

878
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,300
I'm going through with the marriage.

879
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,300
Mom, that's a number three!

880
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,170
If you're going to hit me,
use the driver. I'm ready.

881
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,810
Hit me with the driver.

882

(Marron Confectionery)

883
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,150
What? What do you mean?

884
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,190
The shared payment plan you proposed
for the snack subscription box.

885
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,120
It was intriguing.

886
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,760
It's a shame it didn't get picked.

887
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,890
I liked your Children's Day plan too.

888
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,660
Thank you.

889
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,100
When I checked your references,

890
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,430
everyone had nothing
but high praise for you.

891
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,670
Why did you check my references?

892
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,840
Moving forward,

893
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,040
our company is planning to train
internal communication experts.

894
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,150
Are you interested?

895
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:26,050
But I'm on the Marketing Team.

896
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,950
One of marketing's goals is...

897
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,020
to help people with their work
and lives, right?

898
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,290
After all, marketing is about
helping and communicating,

899
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,560
so it's basically the same job,
just more systematic.

900
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,200
I see.

901
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,940
But...

902
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,110
why are you making me this offer?

903
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,610
I received a recommendation
from a reliable source.

904
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,410
Ms. Kang Eun Sang.

905
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,650
Actually, yesterday...

906
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,650
I attended the disciplinary hearing
for Ms. Kang Eun Sang's case.

907
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,690
And as I listened to Ms. Eun Sang,

908
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,630
I felt a bit ashamed.

909
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,290
The areas our company overlooked,

910
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,000
the Kang Eun Sang Store was
filling the voids...

911
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,300
our company failed to address.

912
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,700
Right.

913
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,900
The Kang Eun Sang Store had
everything you could possibly need.

914
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,440
It wasn't just...

915
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,510
about the merchandise.

916
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,380
(Kang Eun Sang Store,
For When You Need It Most)

917
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:32,920
In this cold and desolate company
where no one has the luxury to care,

918
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,650
whether it was for money
or some other reason,

919
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,520
the fact that there was someone
trying to help others,

920
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,460
that someone was there to empathize
with people who were struggling,

921
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,260
it felt like something out of
a fantasy novel to me.

922
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,170
Completely absurd,

923
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,270
but the kind you can't put down.

924
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,480
Unfortunately, we lost the fantasy
that was Kang Eun Sang,

925
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,210
but the story has to continue, right?

926
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,220
That's the only way people here
can keep on dreaming...

927
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,820
without getting their hearts broken.

928
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,760
And as for that job,

929
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,800
I would like you to be the one
to do it, Da Hae.

Not yet.

937
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,000
Me neither.

938
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,540
I want to keep going.

939
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,380
I'm curious to see
how far this choice,

940
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:12,250
this dream of mine, will take me.

941
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,320
Eun Sang, I want to aim higher.

942
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,520
Me too!

943
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,390
Starting a business
takes a lot of money, after all.

944

You're right.

945

Since when is being
"just a little" ambitious a thing?

946
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,310
Then let's go all the way.

947
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,480
Okay. So what's our final verdict?

948
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,380
- Let's keep going!
- Let's keep going!

But, Da Hae...

951
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,220
Shouldn't we go see Dr. Ham first?

952
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,660
So, have you made your decision?

953
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,240
Dr. Ham.

954
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,110
I have something
I need to tell you...

955
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,850
Wait, what happened to your lip?

956
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,750
This? Don't worry about it.

957
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,250
Listen, I have something
to tell you.

958
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,420
- About our wedding, my mother...
- Can I go first?

959
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,960
I think I'm a person
who wants a lot out of life.

960
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,130
And...

961
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,200
it seems you'd give me everything
I could ever want.

962
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,640
Well, making you president
might be a bit of a stretch.

963
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,280
I've imagined what it would be like
to be married to you.

964
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,820
But in every scenario I imagined,

965
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,990
my happiness always came
only from you.

966
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,190
That's a good thing, right?

967
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,530
But...

968
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,860
that's not the kind of happiness...

969
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,000
I want.

970
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,840
Whether I succeed or fail,

971
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,040
I want to find my own happiness.

972
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,340
That's why I started trading crypto
in the first place.

973
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,080
You're going to end this
on a good note, right?

974
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,920
The truth is...

975
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,050
I don't even know what I would do
if I went to England.

976
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,090
If I just follow you there
as I am now,

977
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,130
I'm afraid I'll want to rely on you
for everything.

978
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,800
And I don't want to be like that.

979
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,230
And I found mine too, you see.

980
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,670
My own version of your guitar.

981
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:51,770
My dream.

982
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,310
I found what I really want
to do at work,

983
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,720
what I'm meant to do.

984
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:02,450
So...

985
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,560
what I'm trying to say is,

986
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,360
- I don't think we should marry.
- Wait.

987
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:18,700
Did my mother really go see you
behind my back?

988
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,300
Did she actually pull your hair?

989
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,910
- No.
- Or did some...

990
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,880
beautiful first love I didn't know
I had show up?

991
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,540
Is someone trying to drive us apart?

992
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:30,610
- No.
- If not that, then maybe...

993
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,780
Don't tell me we're...

994
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:37,020
long-lost half-siblings?

995
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,520
Dr. Ham.

996
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,620
So that's a no, right?

997
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:44,590
Okay, so...

998
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,500
because you don't want
to rely on me,

999
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,530
and you want to stand on your own...

1000
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,870
So, after some soul-searching,

1001
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,870
you've decided not to marry me.
Is that it?

1002
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:58,780
Gosh!

1003
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,510
Gosh, I never in a million years
saw this coming.

1004
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:09,990
Dr. Ham.

1005
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,060
I know it'll be hard for us now,

1006
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,430
- but this is for the best...
- No.

1007
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,960
I can't accept this.

1008
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,970
Dr. Ham tried to find...

1009
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,600
a clear reason
that would help him accept it.

1010
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,910
Was I just being that gullible?

1011
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,110
Was this why everything
just went sideways on me?

1012
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,890
Some days, he'd reflect on the past.

1013
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,820
That time we had the accident
in Namhae...

1014
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,520
Maybe something happened
to your head back then?

1015
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,230
Other days, he'd even resort to
the most useless act of all,

1016
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,060
trying to take back what he'd said.

1017
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,970
I'm not one
to stop someone coming...

1018
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,800
or hold on to someone who leaves.

1019
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,840
You're holding on way too tight.

1020
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,940
But when that didn't work...

1021
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,220
Why are you rolling up
your sleeves now?

1022
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,890
Why do you think?

1023
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,890
Why else would I be doing this?

1024
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,560
Da Hae.

1025
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,510
- I won't go.
- What?

1026
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:45,850
I won't go to England.

1027
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,620
I can just treat music as a hobby.

1028
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,190
Then nothing has to change
between us, right?

1029
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,760
Dr. Ham.

1030
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,790
I can't help it if my feelings
are stronger than yours are for me.

1031
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:57,790
Because I love you more,

1032
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,500
I'll be the one to give it up.

1033
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,460
No, that's not it at all.

1034
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,370
It's just an excuse, isn't it?

1035
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,570
You're upset I'm quitting my job.
That's the real reason, isn't it?

1036
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,070
What did you just say?

1037
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,680
You liked that I had a steady job
and made good money.

1038
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,650
But now that I'm suddenly talking
about doing music,

1039
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,450
you don't see a future in me.

1040
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,250
Isn't that the real problem?

1041
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,720
Don't be ridiculous.

1042
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,760
Come on.
You care more about money than me.

1043
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:36,700
The way you always bring up
my bonus, for one.

1044
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,070
- That's enough.
- Why should I stop?

1045
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,070
If I say I'll stay at the company,
doesn't that fix it?

1046
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,440
That's enough.
Just check your phone.

1047
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,980
I said I'd keep bringing
in the money!

1048

I said to check your phone!

Don't you dare think
I'm that shallow!

1050

your evening medicine.

You have to take it on time
so you don't get a stomachache.

1054
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:11,630
When you are like this...

1055
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,300
When you do things like this for me,

1056
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,570
how could I not love you?

1057
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,140
What am I supposed to do
when your love...

1058
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,450
and cherishment...

1059
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,420
made me believe in myself?

1060
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:32,820
This job used to be a place
I just had to endure,

1061
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,830
but now, it feels like a path
I've chosen for myself.

1062
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,300
So what do you expect me to do,
when I want to see how far I can go?

1063
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:47,600
So whether you go to England,
or America, or even outer space,

1064
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,870
I will go to you...

1065
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,740
when I can stand on my own two feet.

1066
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,310
I will go to you.

1067
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:57,810
I will be the one to come to you.

1068
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,790
How long will I have to wait?

1069
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,120
A year or two years? Three?

1070
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,360
We'll have to be apart
for a long time.

1071
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,260
So just tell me
how long that will be.

1072
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:16,370
Let's...

1073
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,570
Let's say goodbye with a smile.
Okay?

1074
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,710
To make it easier on both of us.

1075
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,210
- Okay?
- Gosh, I can't believe this.

1076
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,320
We're saying goodbye without knowing
when we'll see each other again,

1077
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,520
and you want us to do it
with a smile?

I just...

1080
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,960
Someday, I might look back
on this day and regret it.

1081
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,530
That I was being too ambitious.

1082
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:18,660
If I had just wanted a little less,

1083
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,960
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

1084
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,510
But this desire
to be more than what I am now,

1085
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,180
how can I possibly suppress it?
