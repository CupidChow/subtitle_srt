1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,670
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,040
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,350
Come on in.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,150
Here's a little welcome gift
from the boarding house.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,080
My first place on my own
was a boarding house.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,720
What first captivated my eyes...

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,220
was the perfect lighting that evoked
the weather of the Mediterranean.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,330
But it was a total scam.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,460
The place was north-facing,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,930
so it only got sunlight
for 30 minutes.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,200
Otherwise, it was dark as night,
even in the middle of the day.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,570
Sunlight!

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,310
The landlady was basically
force-feeding us Vitamin D...

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,040
and raising a bunch of zombies.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,340
My second move was to
one of those tiny dorm-style rooms.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,050
It's obviously very clean,
and there's no smell.

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,050
It's a really great place to live.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,320
It was a cramped, old place,
but the sweet scent of vanilla...

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,160
was right up my alley.

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,030
I fell in love with the fragrance
and signed the contract on the spot.

22
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,030
But that too...

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,700
was just a cover-up
for the smell of urine.

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,300
Worst of all, the bathroom
didn't even have a door,

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,840
so that toilet...

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,560
That smell really gets everywhere.

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,630
Okay, now this place...

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,400
The next place I chose was
the studio apartment I live in now.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,470
This has the space of a two-bedroom.

30
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,700
The lighting was good,

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,970
and the toilet
was neatly tucked away.

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,280
In many ways, it seemed like
a decent enough place.

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,810
You won't find a place better than this
in this neighborhood.

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,020
But there's no threshold step
into the room.

35
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,980
What?
It's good because you won't trip.

36
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,050
So, are you signing or not?

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,630
Gosh, my wallet!

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,530
My wallet.

39
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,110
Darn it.

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,040
Since there's no entryway step,

41
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,680
I keep forgetting
to take my shoes off.

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,150
I've lived in Seoul for three years.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,850
After moving several times,
I finally realized something.

44
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,190
When you don't have money,
"taste" or "style" is a luxury.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,930
It's something you have to pare down
to fit reality.

46
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,800
But do I really have to go through
this painful process all over again?

47
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,370
- So? You're moving out, right?
- Yes.

48
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,970
Gosh, with that creep from before,

49
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,140
I just assumed you wouldn't want
to renew the lease.

50
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,370
No, but I hoped we could still have
a serious talk about...

51
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,040
Well, I'm raising the rent.

52
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,110
You'll be listing the apartment
yourself then, right?

53
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,150
Gosh, the entryway is so dusty.
Goodness, all this dust.

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,320
Where am I supposed to find
another place now?

55
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,090
Rental hopper.
I'm so sick and tired of this.

56
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,560
(Episode 3:
A Taste for the Averages)

57
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,930
(Enderium)

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,030
You need money for a place.

59
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,330
(Enderium, 38.07 dollars)

60
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,600
What?

61
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,400
Did it go up a little?

62
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,370
Like it matters.
I only put in ten dollars.

63
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,520
I'm done trying harder!

64
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,860
What was that?

65
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,260
What memory was that?

66
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,530
- Jung Da Hae.
- Yes?

67
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,630
Hi.

68
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,330
Why aren't you responding
in the chat?

69
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,740
Hey, there are 228 messages.
I can't even get through them all.

70
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,240
I don't get how you talk so much
first thing in the morning.

71
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,980
Okay, so, to recap
what happened last night...

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,710
We've been over it 228 times,
and you still need a recap?

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,580
Da Hae got totally wasted, right?

74
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,720
That's right. Eun Sang.
How wasted was I last night?

75
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,550
- On a 1-10 scale, how bad was it?
- Like, an 81?

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,520
You were an 81 on the wasted scale,

77
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,730
and you finally caved
and started doing crypto.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,660
She only bought ten dollars' worth.

79
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,360
That doesn't even count.

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,630
I'm just testing the waters.
Anyway, enough about me.

81
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,000
So, what's your deal?

82
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,900
Are you really set on Beijing?

83
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,510
Ta-da!

84
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,380
I got a super cheap deal.

85
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,710
I can head straight to the airport
right after work tomorrow.

86
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,620
It's China, not the next town over.
Why are you always so impulsive?

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Unbelievable.

88
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,850
- Hang on.
- What is it?

89
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,790
Should we grab one before we go in?
Do we have time?

90
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,590
- We're eating. I'm starving.
- I know, right?

91
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,730
I'm supposed to be
on a diet, though.

92
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,900
So you have to move again?

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,270
My lease is almost up anyway,

94
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,330
and I don't want to
stay there anymore.

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,040
That's true.
That neighborhood is too dangerous.

96
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,070
Hey, are you guys
even listening to me?

97
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,810
I'm telling you, my relationship is
in danger right now.

98
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,180
I'm pretty sure Wei Lin is cheating.
He barely answers my calls,

99
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,950
and something just feels really off.

100
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,920
Forget that. Seen your bank account?
Now that's something to worry about.

101
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,250
Oh, here it is.

102
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

103
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,790
Anyway,
are you going to the alumni reunion?

104
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,860
I'm not sure.

105
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,760
There's something I want to see,
so I'm tempted.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,070
Don't tell me it's an old flame.
Who is it?

107
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,970
- Black garlic.
- What?

108
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,270
My gosh.

109
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,770
For the 50th anniversary,

110
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,780
an alum is giving out
black garlic extract.

111
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,640
The fee is only ten dollars,

112
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,710
but the garlic extract
itself costs 50 dollars.

113
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,380
It resells for about 45 dollars.

114
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,720
If it's unopened,
I can get at least 38 dollars.

115
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,890
It's a pretty good flip.

116
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,460
You must've been busy with the math.
I'm so impressed.

117
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,620
- Gosh.
- What's wrong?

118
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,860
It just hurts.

119
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,900
It feels like I slammed my head
into something.

120
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,730
Hey, did you black out last night,
by any chance?

121
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,640
Do you even remember
coming over to my place?

122
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,370
Yes, I remember that part.

123
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,470
I didn't do anything dumb
last night, did I?

124
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,310
Da Hae. Don't buy coffee just yet.

125
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,650
(Coffee and Toast)

126
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm so sorry.
I was drunk and out of line, right?

127
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,260
Oh, no, not at all.
And as for the presentation...

128
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,990
Oh, say no more.

129
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,660
I know mine just wasn't good enough.

130
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,330
Now my head's clear, I can see that.

131
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,800
The materials, the ideas...

132
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,770
Yours were so much better.

133
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,670
You definitely deserved it.

134
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,570
I appreciate you saying that.

135
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,480
- Should we head in?
- Actually...

136
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,010
Da Hee.

137
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,550
Is your forehead okay?

138
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm really not a violent person,
I swear.

139
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,320
But last night,
I don't know what came over me.

140
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,460
I'm sorry?
What are you talking about?

141
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,290
I headbutted your forehead,

142
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,660
didn't I?

143
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,060
What?

144
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,960
Da Hae, did you hit someone?

145
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,930
What?

146
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,900
If it wasn't you, then...

147
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,370
who was it?

148
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,710
It opens with a woman
sitting in an interrogation room.

149
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,310
Every man she's ever dated...

150
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,810
has died
under mysterious circumstances,

151
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,320
and sensing something is wrong,
a detective interrogates her.

152
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,490
"You're the culprit, aren't you?
How did you kill so many people?"

153
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,220
And then,
with a wicked little smile,

154
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,830
she pulls this out.

155
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,990
(Lonely Potato)

156
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,100
Lonely Potato.

157
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,130
The detective takes Lonely Potato...

158
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,200
and takes a bite,
feeling mesmerized.

159
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,770
And right there on the spot,

160
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,740
he drops dead.

161
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,940
Followed by the tagline.

162
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,020
Lonely Potato.
It's drop-dead delicious.

163
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,990
Check the "conscience line"
on the back of the bag.

164
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,420
And for the closing line.

165
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,460
Marron Confectionery.

166
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,830
If one of two people has to die,
why is it always the man?

167
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,830
Because our female model
is still under contract.

168
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,370
But wouldn't it make more sense
if the female model ate them too?

169
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,140
We'd have to pay
a penalty fee first.

170
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,680
Dropping her would mean
three times her original fee.

171
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,340
Are we supposed to pay that?

172
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,850
I like it.

173
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,180
On second thought,

174
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,680
I see no problem.

175
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,920
The commercial is incredibly fresh
and really speaks to today's youth.

176
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,730
The promise not to sell a bag of air
but to fill it to the line.

177
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,090
This "conscience line"
was shown so well.

178
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,730
Yes, that conscience line.

179
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,030
Wasn't that your idea too, Dr. Ham?

180
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,030
You didn't spend much on the design,
but with just a single line...

181
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,340
Gosh. That is something else.

182
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,570
- I'll contact the female model.
- What's your secret?

183
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,250
What's the secret to pulling it off
so successfully every single time?

184
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,510
You have to be crazy.

185
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,550
You mean crazy passionate, right?

186
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,590
- No.
- What?

187
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,720
I'm saying
the world has to be crazy.

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,630
I mean, I'm just spitballing here,
so why...

189
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,100
Why does everything
keep working out?

190
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,470
By the way,
what happened to your forehead?

191
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,640
That's what I'm about to find out.

192
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,010
Just pick the design you like best,
and let's go with it!

193
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,380
All right.

194
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,010
Hey, how is it a perfect tie?
Hold on. One, two, three, four...

195
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,020
What? Who hasn't voted yet?

196
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,660
Is it you again, Ms. Round?

197
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,160
I was just about to...

198
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,790
Yours is the deciding vote.

199
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,790
You know it, right?
This is a five-million-dollar project.

200
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,360
Darn it. I should've
just voted quickly and blended in.

201
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,970
He just needs a scapegoat.

202
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,140
What are you doing?

203
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,870
Right. Okay, let me see.

204
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,540
Where should I put my vote?

205
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,640
Hello, sir.

206
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,810
Dr. Ham, what brings you here?

207
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,720
I heard about the new snack meeting,
so I thought I would stop by.

208
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,620
We're glad to have you.
Please, have a seat here.

209
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,750
- No, I'll just sit over...
- Where? Which one?

210
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,690
- Right this way.
- Here you go.

211
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Please, sit.

212
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,470
Dr. Ham, your timing is perfect.

213
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,540
We were just picking
a package design...

214
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,880
for our new product, Lonely Potato.

215
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,450
We'd be grateful for a dash
of your brilliant insight.

216
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,420
Do any of these...

217
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,450
grab you?

218
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,560
But shouldn't the team's opinion
be what matters most here?

219
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,890
Excuse me?

220
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
What do you think?

221
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,470
Pardon? Me?

222
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,530
Yes.

223
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,270
You don't like any of them?

224
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,340
- No, it's just...
- Not your style, I guess?

225
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,710
Then what about this one?

226
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,110
You don't like it?

227
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,880
Not the style you're looking for?

228
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,480
- You like new releases, don't you?
- Sorry?

229
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,450
I want to have the latest phone too.

230
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,490
What is this?

231
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,820
Why do I keep remembering something?

232
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,560
Okay, how about this one?
Is this one no good either?

233
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,360
Maybe it'd go better
with regular coffee...

234
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,700
instead of one with cream?

235
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,230
The truth is,
I really crave one with cream.

236
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,300
This is weird.

237
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,200
Something I'm not meant to remember
keeps trying to come back to me.

238
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
All right.

239
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,010
How about this one? Still no good?

240
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,610
Doesn't it look good
from this angle?

241
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,170
I'm done trying harder!

242
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,030
Darn it.

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,040
What was that?

244
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,770
Is it a crime to like that song?
So what if I do?

245
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,840
Why not?
I'm allowed my own preferences.

246
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,410
I want to have the latest phone too.

247
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,480
I know it looks better.

248
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,620
And even when I get regular coffee
just because it's ten cents cheaper,

249
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,860
the truth is,
I really crave one with cream.

250
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,130
And when I met that jerk Byeong Jun
on our group date,

251
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,330
I was actually more into the guy
sitting across from me.

252
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,540
But Byeong Jun was the one
who came on so strong.

253
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,570
So I just went out with him.
Do you get it?

254
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,380
I have songs that I like too.

255
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,350
What I'm saying is,
I have my own taste!

256
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,600
I never should have hired you...

257
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,460
three years ago.

258
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,770
You should be on the national team.

259
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,570
- What?
- I'm right, aren't I?

260
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,340
You're so thick-headed,

261
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,070
so you should've joined
the Winter Games.

262
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,540
Not wasted your talent
at this company.

263
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,440
Oh, headbutting isn't
a Winter Games sport?

264
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,320
I'm sorry.
I was upset and drank too much.

265
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,650
I'm truly sorry.

266
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,520
Are you
going to fire me or something?

267
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,760
And if I do,
do you have somewhere to go?

268
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,800
Somewhere to go...

269
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,500
I can only turn
to the Internet world.

270
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,070
I'll post I was fired unfairly.
I'll ask people to hear my side...

271
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,410
and rally the angry netizens.

272
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,980
It's all I can do.

273
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,510
You have this all planned out.

274
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,680
And what? "Fired unfairly?"

275
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,350
Are you really the one
being wronged here?

276
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,560
Well, it was a drunken mistake.

277
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,830
I'd never do that sober, obviously.

278
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,790
Then was that just
the alcohol talking too?

279
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,900
You prefer coffee with cream
and prefer new phones.

280
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,000
And my...

281
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,870
That...

282
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,040
That song is the best.
That it was your one and only song.

283
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
I don't know about that.

284
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,510
I don't think I said it was
the one and only song I'd ever love.

285
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,480
What? What's the meaning
of "favorite song?"

286
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,420
Isn't that your go-to karaoke song?
Your go-to has to be a single song.

287
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,720
You can't have a bunch of them,
can you?

288
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,020
I'm so sorry.

289
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,230
But is it really something
to get this angry about?

290
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,700
Look, I just...

291
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,470
Thinking about it, this is weird.

292
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,000
Why do you keep picking apart
my personal taste?

293
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,610
Pick... I'm not picking.

294
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,140
I'm just curious.

295
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,180
- About me?
- No.

296
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,580
About me.

297
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,350
I'm curious about myself.

298
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,850
I want to know how much of me
is still left out there.

299
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,220
What's left out there?

300
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Possibility.

301
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Sorry?

302
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,890
So, do you have a boyfriend yet?

303
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,470
- This takes a lot of hand strength.
- Yes, tell me about it.

304
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,530
How many is that now?

305
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,940
Hey, how about
we all grab lunch together today?

306
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,810
- What?
- It's my treat.

307
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,680
- What? Really?
- No way!

308
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,050
I think I'm going to pass
on lunch today.

309
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,220
What? But without you,

310
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,620
it won't be "everyone."

311
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,650
Should we just go another time?

312
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,590
Oh, no. You guys go ahead.

313
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,620
I'm on a diet.

314
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,320
Come on.

315
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,760
But Assistant Manager Oh
is treating us.

316
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,890
Ji Song.

317
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,890
(Read the room.)

318
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,160
Please read the room.

319
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,170
All right. Well, shall we get going?

320
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,840
- So, what should we get?
- Let's get something really good.

321
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,140
We have to get something expensive.

322
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,840
All right, something expensive
and delicious, then.

323
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,040
What is all this?

324
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,910
(Seizure notice,
Kang Eun Sang Store)

325
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,320
(Kang Eun Sang Store)

326
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,280
Isn't that a seizure sticker?

327
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,020
It's not a seizure notice.
I think it's from the Kang Eun Sang Store.

328
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,490
What?

329
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,560
The owner hates people
who don't pay back.

330
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,160
What will you do, Ms. Jo?

331
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,260
Looks like you messed
with the wrong person.

332
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,200
That crazy wench.

333
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,970
(Inplugged)

334
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,640
Hey, guys, I can't do lunch today.

335
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,880
And Kang Eun Sang Store is the best!

336
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,510
Long live Kang Eun Sang Store!

337
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,750
What's all this about?

338
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,890
Oh, hey.

339
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,460
- Is this one okay?
- Yes.

340
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,930
That'll be five dollars.

341
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

342
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,000
- Oh, you're here.
- Whether I've lost my appetite or not,

343
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,900
or whether Ji Song eats lunch or not,

344
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,930
Thank you.

345
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,770
Eun Sang is as busy as ever,
just trying to make a living.

346
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,720
Open Eun Sang's right desk drawer,
and you'll find a whole new world.

347
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,820
Kang Eun Sang Store.

348
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,020
To buy items from this one-stop shop
that had everything,

349
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,390
people flocked to the Sales Team
every day.

350
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,090
- Welcome.
- Hi, I need a pair of stockings.

351
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,930
Prices are lower than anywhere else.

352
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,060
People wonder if the store has
the items they want.

353
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,370
It's that uncanny knack of hers
for having everything.

354
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,040
These were all major contributors
to the store's success.

355
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,810
The greatest factor of all was
her own brilliant salesmanship.

356
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,270
Hey, can I get something
for a headache?

357
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,840
For a hangover,

358
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,980
a recovery drink is better
than pills.

359
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,380
A 3-blade or a 4-blade?

360
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,320
Look, I hear Director Choi
is attending the meeting later.

361
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,820
You know Boomer Choi
won't let it slide...

362
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,520
if you're not shaven
and dressed well.

363
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,360
I've got razors with 3 to 7 blades.
Just say the word.

364
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,460
My gosh.

365
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,830
With that stubble, you're going to
need the turbo blade.

366
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,400
She had a knack
for predicting market trends...

367
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,330
and a brilliance for providing
exactly what the customer needed.

368
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,900
You have those throat lozenges?
How much for one?

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,070
It's five dollars.

370
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,510
What?

371
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,510
Seriously? You're charging
five dollars for a single lozenge?

372
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,350
Because I'll throw this in for free.

373
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,210
You were about due for a new pack,
weren't you?

374
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,450
A throat lozenge,
and the cigarettes are free.

375
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,890
Goodness, you're so clever.

376
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,490
Her fresh approach was
another reason,

377
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,590
always thinking outside the box.

378
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,090
- What if I pay with a card?
- I'll have to add tax.

379
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,230
She was, in every sense of the word,
a master merchant.

380
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,430
But the more successful you become,
the more enemies you make.

381
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Excuse me.

382
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,970
- Did you do this?
- I did.

383
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,510
You put seizure stickers on my desk?
How could you vandalize my desk?

384
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,710
Just a second.

385
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,850
Okay, let's see.

386
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,950
December 22, 2 cup noodles.

387
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,520
December 23, 1 energy drink.

388
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,660
Dec 26, 3 pain patches
and a tube of toothpaste that night.

389
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,730
Look, I don't usually run a tab,

390
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,430
but you were so desperate,
so I made an exception.

391
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,540
But you never paid me back,
so I had no choice.

392
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,970
Fine, I'll pay you!

393
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,070
I just forgot.

394
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,840
It's not like
I was trying to stiff you.

395
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,540
Right.

396
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,150
Money is something
you can always pay back.

397
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,220
But some debts can never be repaid.

398
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,350
Kim Ji Song.

399
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,190
Who does she think she is,
acting up like that?

400
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
(Assistant Manager Jo Su Jin)

401
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,090
What's that supposed to mean?

402
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,430
Because you shouldn't be so quick
to run your mouth.

403
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,300
That's a debt you can't repay.

404
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,300
What's that supposed to mean?

405
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm not taking cards today.

406
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,380
Wire the money
to this account, please.

407
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,280
Let's go.

408
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
What was that?

409
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,390
It's nothing.

410
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,020
Why that...

411
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,630
Gosh, I'm so upset!

412
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,770
- How much?
- How much what?

413
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,270
How much do you make a month
from your side hustle?

414
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,880
In a month?

415
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,710
About six...

416
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,380
Six hundred?

417
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,710
You're crazy!

418
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,820
What? Lunch is on you today.

419
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,020
You're buying coffee too.
Right, I'll have that cake.

420
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,420
Chocolate and cheesecake flavors.

421
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,620
Gosh, 600 dollars?

422
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,260
Unbelievable.

423
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,060
It's a little less than 60 dollars
a month.

424
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Let's just go.

425
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,010
Lunch is on me today.

426
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,240
Really?

427
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,410
By the way,
why did Kang Eun Sang Store...

428
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,750
put on seizure stickers?

429
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,280
That's what I heard.

430
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,950
- Oh, really?
- Oh, let me get that for you.

431
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
- Thank you.
- Of course.

432
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,990
Hey, what's all this?

433
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,330
- Why are you only serving Ji Song?
- What?

434
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
You're right.

435
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,160
My plate is empty too.

436
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,500
Oh, right. I'll get you some.

437
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,140
Earlier, I saw him put
two napkins under Ji Song's spoon.

438
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,240
Oh, no, that's not it.

439
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,440
It's true.

440
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,510
He said he'd only buy us lunch
if Ji Song came.

441
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,250
What is all this?
What's going on between you two?

442
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,710
- Are you...
- That's not it.

443
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,920
I have a boyfriend.

444
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Stop trying to make it a thing.

445
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,930
I'm just going to go get some water.

446
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Okay.

447
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,870
Ji Song, Mr. Oh is
a good catch, don't you think?

448
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,100
What?

449
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,240
I think you and Mr. Oh
would be a cute couple.

450
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,910
A guy like Mr. Oh
isn't a bad prospect for you.

451
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,310
I told you, I have a boyfriend.

452
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,550
I know,

453
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,020
but isn't he a foreigner
or something?

454
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,420
That's so long-distance.

455
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,820
Doesn't that make you anxious?

456
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,990
Plus, it seems like you two
barely talk these days.

457
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,120
That's not true.

458
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,500
We talk all the time.

459
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,830
Okay, fine. No need to shout.

460
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,770
You scared me.

461
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,570
It happens.

462
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,370
(Lunch with coworkers.
Hope your lunch is good too!)

463
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,450
So you said you had a boyfriend?

464
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,450
Well, what do you expect?
He asked all of a sudden.

465
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,260
Is it that obvious I don't have one?

466
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,290
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

467
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,660
But that guy's something else.

468
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,630
He didn't ask you
if you "had" a boyfriend.

469
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,630
He said "yet."
What's that supposed to mean?

470
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,570
How did he know
you just broke up with someone?

471
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,570
I know, right?

472
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,280
It probably just came out that way.

473
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,880
Whatever. You won't see him again,
so just forget about it.

474
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,750
Actually, we're not quite done.

475
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,750
What do you mean?

476
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,090
He gave me this.

477
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,860
What is this?

478
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,500
An invitation to a live club?
He said to bring my boyfriend.

479
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,070
He said he was going to be there
tomorrow too.

480
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,170
- Gosh.
- You must be a terrible liar.

481
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,370
So he's trying to see for himself
if you actually have a boyfriend.

482
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,470
What am I going to do?

483
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,810
I just took it in the moment,
but who am I going to go there with?

484
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,750
Just go on a blind date.

485
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,550
You just need a guy to go
with you tomorrow, right?

486
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,050
Go on a blind date.
I'll get my people on it.

487
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,620
Are you in a gang or something?

488
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,090
Just leave it to me.

489
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,860
My stomach really hurts.

490
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,830
Does anyone have something
for indigestion?

491
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,800
(Averages)

492
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,830
I do.

493
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,670
I have some.
Want me to bring it for you?

494
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,170
I'll come by for it later.

495
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,770
I feel sick from eating with them.

496
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,540
Anyway, Da Hae, have any selfies?

497
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,010
Exchanging photos is a must
for a blind date, you know.

498
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,310
Go look through your photo gallery.
Come on.

499
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,680
(Jung Da Hae)

500
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,750
This looks
like my grandma's photo album.

501
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,430
No way.
This looks like my grandma's album.

502
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,030
Which senior center are you from?
This is not going to work.

503
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,900
Let's start with a photo op.

504
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,270
- To Da Hae's after work!
- Okay.

505
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,770
But Eun Sang, why are you so quiet?

506
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,670
Don't just ignore us, Eun Sang.

507
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,380
Okay.

508
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,620
What are you all doing?
Hurry up. Get a move on!

509
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,390
The Materials Management Department
is in chaos.

510
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,160
Why? What's going on?

511
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,990
- A fire at the Cheongju Factory.
- What?

512
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,360
The Materials Management Department
has to pull all-nighters from today.

513
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,960
I hear it's chaos.

514
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,800
Oh gosh, that's terrible.
That's so rough for them.

515
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,270
- Who told you that?
- Hoppang Bite.

516
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,400
"Hoppang Bite?"

517
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,070
It's an ID on the company board.

518
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,110
They post
all the office gossip here.

519
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,580
You know Manager Jo from PR?

520
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,350
- Yes.
- They revealed he wears a toupee,

521
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,480
and Assistant Manager Choi
and Assistant Manager Sung in HR...

522
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,990
had a fling and then broke up,
making it weird.

523
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,590
They don't use real names,
but you know exactly who they mean.

524
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,690
But still, exposing someone
for wearing a toupee...

525
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,400
is crossing a line.

526
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,770
They haven't posted anything
about me, have they?

527
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,640
- Sorry? Well, that's...
- Have they posted about me?

528
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,740
No, of course not.

529
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,600
Who is it?
Who's been bad-mouthing me?

530
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,640
- It's nothing, sir.
- Get over here, you little punks!

531
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,740
If anyone was bad-mouthing you,
you think I'd just let it slide?

532
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,080
Why did you turn it off?

533
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,510
- It's not what you think.
- Show me!

534
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,580
Umbrellas? Why umbrellas?

535
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,620
There's a 90-percent chance
of rain tomorrow.

536
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,020
People who don't check the forecast,
the ones who know but are too lazy,

537
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,360
and especially the folks
in the Materials Department...

538
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,560
who can't go home tonight.

539
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,160
With all of them,
we can sell 30 in no time.

540
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,100
Gosh, all you ever think about
is making a quick buck.

541
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,930
And what do you think about?

542
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,970
Goodness, look at all this mold.

543
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,640
Hey, those are my pets.
Watch your mouth.

544
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,710
Gross.

545
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,310
I told my landlord I was moving out,
but I haven't heard back.

546
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,320
I even said they could show it
to prospective tenants whenever.

547
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,620
Do you even have a new place
lined up?

548
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,850
There are plenty of places.
I've got one in Cheongdam...

549
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,360
and another one in Pangyo.

550
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,860
It's just that I can't afford them.

551
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,060
Exactly.

552
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,490
You need to invest more in crypto.

553
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,730
Stop playing around
with ten dollars.

554
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,230
Don't you have more saved up?

555
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,870
- Like your savings account.
- My savings? Are you kidding?

556
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,410
- To the moon?
- What?

557
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm telling you, we have to go
all the way to the moon.

558
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,810
You think you can afford a ticket
to the moon with that?

559
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,750
If we're going, we have to go big.

560
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,050
Okay. Everybody up.

561
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,550
Perfect.

562
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Ta-da!

563
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,290
We got it.

564
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,800
- All right. Next.
- Again?

565
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,070
Laugh, naturally.
Like you're having fun.

566
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,470
We're all best friends, remember?

567
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,480
One, two, three.

568
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,330
Done.

569
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,400
This really looks
like we were on Jeju Island.

570
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,130
Hey, you've got a gift.

571
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,730
Not bad.

572
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,870
Well, you have to have
at least one vacation selfie.

573
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,700
Okay. Here.

574
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,840
- Here, put these on.
- What are these?

575
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,410
Swimsuits?

576
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,010
The concept's a beach in Jeju,
so we have to wear swimsuits.

577
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,120
Swimsuits? In the dead of winter?
Are you crazy?

578
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,720
Relax, it's just from the waist up.
You can just keep your pants on.

579
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,160
Isn't this a bit much?

580
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,830
We need this level of realism
to pass off a fake as the real deal.

581
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,000
If you don't want to,
just tell him that you lied.

582
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,200
- That you don't have a boyfriend.
- Okay, fine.

583
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,640
But seriously, this is a bit much,
don't you think?

584
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,570
What size are these?

585
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,710
What is this freak show?

586
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,910
- Why not?
- Gosh, it's too small.

587
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,180
You guys look great.

588
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,250
- It's so tight. Gosh.
- Gosh.

589
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,850
Hurry up.
Just take the picture already.

590
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,520
Okay, I get it. Welcome to Jeju!

591
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,920
Make it sexy, you guys.

592
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,090
Three,

593
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,930
two, three, two, three.

594
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,600
Two, three.

595
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,730
Two, three.

596
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,900
This place may not look like much,
but it has a great layout.

597
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,670
- Go on, take a good look around.
- Oh, my gosh!

598
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
My goodness!

599
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,780
Get dressed!

600
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,450
What's this? Why are you home?

601
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,520
Where else would I be? I live here.

602
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,120
What are you doing here, ma'am?

603
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,050
You said you were moving,

604
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,920
so I brought someone by to see it.

605
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,460
You're the one who gave me the code.
You said I could come by anytime!

606
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,230
You could've at least called first.

607
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,730
Check your phone.
I called you more than ten times!

608
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,230
You said if you didn't pick up,
I should just let myself in!

609
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,400
Oh, you did call.

610
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,040
Ma'am, we'll look elsewhere.
This place isn't right for my child.

611
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,240
- No, ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

612
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,780
Ma'am, it's not like that! Wait!

613
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,350
Goodness, what a bunch
of weirdos you are.

614
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,310
Running around half-naked at night.

615
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,950
Put on some clothes!

616
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,620
- We are dressed!
- We are dressed!

617
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,360
It's not that I wanted to go.

618
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,130
No, it wasn't that
I didn't like her, either.

619
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,260
I'm just not in a place
to be seeing anyone right now.

620
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,630
You're right. Point taken.

621
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,270
I deserved that drink thrown at me
for having such a rotten mindset.

622
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,910
I zoned out for a second
and was incredibly rude to her.

623
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,010
Gosh.

624
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,690
Mom, you sound
pretty worked up right now.

625
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,090
Why don't you relax for a moment
in somewhere nice and cool?

626
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,730
(Mother)

627
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:27,980
(Marron Confectionery)

628
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,790
What are you getting for lunch?

629
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,060
The cafeteria is serving
spicy pork today.

630
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,160
Yes, spicy pork!

631
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,830
Let's go.

632
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,400
Aren't you getting lunch, Da Hae?

633
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,800
Oh, I have to be somewhere.

634
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,470
A great place just opened up
near your work.

635
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,910
It's going to get snapped up fast.
Hurry over and take a look.

636
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,710
Come on in.

637
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,080
It's south-facing,
so it gets great light.

638
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,050
It's great for drying laundry...

639
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,820
and perfect for keeping houseplants.

640
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,200
And here's the bathroom.

641
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,340
There's a step up.
There's a threshold.

642
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,480
So what do you think?
It's nice, right?

643
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,210
How much is this place?

644
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,620
It's going to cost you
this much more.

645
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,250
What? Is that too much of a stretch?

646
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,130
(Dangsan Station)

647
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
You're kidding me!

648
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,900
You really made that much money
so quickly?

649
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,100
Watch this.

650
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,600
I'm about to pay off my debt.

651
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,810
(Loan Repayment)

652
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,310
(Living Expense Support Loan,
Full repayment)

653
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,350
(Processing)

654
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,850
(Processing)

655
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,250
(Your loan has been paid in full.)

656
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,620
(Your loan has been paid in full.)

657
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,690
See that? I just paid off
Living Expense Support Loan.

658
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,560
Gosh, I can't believe I saw that
in person. Incredible.

659
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,730
I still have so much left
on my student loans.

660
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,840
That's why you need to get on board.
The crypto train.

661
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,510
Put some more money in.

662
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,580
Stop messing around
with that measly ten dollars.

663
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,950
Don't you get it?

664
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,050
For us, it's our only out.

665
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,160
The crypto train?

666
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,040
(Enderium, 40.80 dollars)

667
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,110
What?

668
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,110
It actually went up a bit.

669
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,650
Then again,
I only put in ten dollars.

670
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,120
Transfer complete.

671
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,460
Insufficient funds.

672
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,730
Miss, your card was declined.

673
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,300
Miss, you need to add more money
to your card.

674
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I wish I had money to add.

675
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,040
Miss!

676
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Yes?

677
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,630
It's raining.

678
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,610
- It's Rain!
- No way! This is awesome!

679
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,010
It's Rain! It's really him, Rain!

680
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,250
- Is it raining right now?
- Rain is here!

681
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,480
Rain is here! He's here!

682
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,290
But it's not raining.

683
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,620
No, I'm talking about Jeong Ji Hoon.

684
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,290
- Kim Tae Hee's husband.
- What?

685
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,630
He's on the first floor in a meeting
about our ad campaign.

686
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,830
- We have to go get his autograph.
- Darn it!

687
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,570
Never mind.

688
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,380
What is this?

689
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,980
I'm so sorry.

690
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,050
Do you really think "sorry"
is going to fix this?

691
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,620
You copied and pasted everything
from last year.

692
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,790
Since when does February
have 31 days?

693
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,590
What are you, Ji Song?
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time?"

694
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,600
- It just slipped my mind.
- Slipped your mind?

695
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,630
Some things can't slip your mind.

696
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,040
Fix every last one of these
before you go home.

697
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,600
- Got it?
- Yes.

698
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,410
Wait, what?

699
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,510
You mean today?

700
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,410
But I already booked a flight
for today.

701
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,610
So?

702
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,010
Are you saying you can't do it?

703
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
No.

704
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
I'll have to do it.

705
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,450
I have to, right?

706
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,630
Gosh.
It'll take forever to fix all this.

707
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
- Want me to help you out?
- What?

708
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,030
I can just push my blind date back.

709
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,100
Besides, I've been feeling down
all day anyway.

710
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Forget it.

711
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,870
Don't all office workers feel bad?

712
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,740
You go on your date. I'll help you.

713
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,710
I appreciate it, you guys,

714
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,980
but these documents
are confidential.

715
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,380
I have to do it by myself.

716
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,580
Aren't you going to miss
your flight?

717
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,550
I'll just have to make sure I don't.

718
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,720
Who's she calling?

719
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,150
The National Weather Service.
She's asking when it'll rain.

720
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,260
- Did you get through?
- Yes, I think I'm about to.

721
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,490
She's been saying that for an hour.

722
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,030
- She should just give up already.
- Oh, my!

723
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,600
- Eun Sang, you're still here.
- Oh, yes.

724
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,770
- Hello.
- That's a rare sight.

725
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,410
You usually leave at Mach speed
the second the clock strikes five.

726
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,540
Oh, right.

727
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,540
The Materials Department is leaving.
You should head out soon too.

728
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,380
What? The Materials Department
is leaving?

729
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,480
They're not pulling an all-nighter?

730
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,880
I guess factory work ended early.
They were all heading out.

731
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
What?

732
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,460
Since we don't have to work late,
want to grab a drink?

733
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,090
No.

734
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,260
Oh, no, this can't be happening.

735
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,170
But it's not even raining yet.

736
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,240
No! This can't be happening.

737
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,070
Gosh, Eun Sang.

738
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,170
Connecting you to an operator now.

739
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,640
Thank you for calling
the National Weather Service.

740
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Hello?

741
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,910
Is this the
National Weather Service?

742
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,250
Didn't your forecast say
it was going to rain today?

743
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,360
What?
The cloud formation just changed?

744
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,960
You're supposed to give a forecast,
not a live play-by-play!

745
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,660
What are you, a sports announcer
calling a soccer match?

746
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,130
What about my umbrellas?

747
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,030
- My umbrellas!
- Goodness, Eun Sang.

748
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,500
- Eun Sang!
- Are you okay?

749
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,610
Eun Sang!

750
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,110
Gosh, she's terrifying.

751
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,140
Eun Sang, are you okay?

752
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,550
(Marron Confectionery)

753
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,530
- Ji Song.
- You scared me!

754
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,570
Sorry about that.

755
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,140
- You're still here?
- Yes.

756
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,040
By any chance,
do you need some help?

757
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,440
Sure, I guess.

758
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,710
What?

759
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,750
All done.

760
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,690
Thank you, Mr. Oh. I really mean it.

761
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,760
Not at all.

762
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,660
- Should I put this here?
- Oh, yes, right there. Thanks.

763
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,760
Hey, Ji Song,
let me give you a ride.

764
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,700
What? Oh no, that's okay.

765
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,500
But you're going to the airport,
right?

766
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,570
I just got a new car,
and it's really nice.

767
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,470
Come on, you'll be late. Hurry!

768
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,910
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.

769
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,310
Let's go. Yes. Come on.

770
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,690
So, Da Hae, what do you do for fun?

771
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,300
For fun?

772
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,000
Hanging out, sleeping, and eating.

773
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,700
I'm a big fan of hiking.

774
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,510
I actually went to Bukhan Mountain
last week,

775
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,810
and the breeze at the summit
felt amazing.

776
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,410
Oh, right.

777
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,720
As for me...

778
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,650
My friend Ji Song loves surfing.
You know her, right?

779
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,090
That's how she met her boyfriend.

780
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,090
Right. I know.

781
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,060
- So what about you, Da Hae?
- And our coworker, Eun Sang,

782
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,900
she sometimes watches bullfights
in Cheongdo on her days off.

783
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,810
She says watching bulls lock horns
melts her stress away, apparently.

784
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,710
Oh, okay. That's interesting.

785
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,780
Yes, right?

786
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,780
So what about you, Da Hae?
What do you do on your days off?

787
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,820
On my days off?

788
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,950
I just veg out.

789
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,120
I also enjoy playing the piano.

790
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,460
I can even play quite a few songs
by heart.

791
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,700
I'll have to play for you sometime.

792
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,230
Yes, that'd be great.

793
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,800
So what about you, Da Hae?

794
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
I...

795
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,480
I guess I like to read.

796
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,250
Oh? You like reading?

797
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,780
I love reading.

798
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,220
Have you read
any good books recently?

799
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,920
The last thing
I enjoyed reading was...

800
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,720
was...

801
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,600
the "Practical Excel Guide" manual.

802
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,100
Oh, Excel?

803
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,670
Oh, right. Excel.

804
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,170
Yes, spreadsheets are important,
for sure.

805
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,780
For office workers.

806
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,990
We've really hit a lot of traffic.

807
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,630
(Friday, December 29)

808
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,440
Would you like a piece of gum?

809
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,810
Oh, no, I'm good.

810
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,950
<i>Now that you're gone</i>

811
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,650
<i>Falling in your dream</i>

812
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,420
<i>I don't want to wake up,</i>
<i>it goes on and on</i>

813
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,920
<i>Promised that I'll never forget you</i>

814
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,360
<i>And I know I can't live without you</i>

815
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,960
Wait a second.
You were given these tickets?

816
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,030
- Yes, from my boss at work.
- Gosh.

817
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,600
What a great boss.
This is a really popular venue.

818
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,270
Oh, yes, I can tell.

819
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,910
<i>Everything is all blue</i>

820
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,610
Thank you.

821
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,120
Before we play our next song
for you,

822
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,450
we have a special guest vocalist
joining us tonight.

823
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,890
Now, how can I best describe him?

824
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,430
An ill-fated singer who was forced
to retire the moment he debuted?

825
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,060
A tragic genius ahead of his time?

826
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,170
Anyway, he's a singer!
Yes, a singer.

827
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,940
Please welcome
singer-songwriter Ham Ji Woo!

828
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,390
I'm here to sing, so there's no need
for a long speech, right?

829
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:50,020
This song launched my career
and ended it all at once.

830
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,160
I'll sing it for you now.

831
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,970
What are you doing up there?

832
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,720
<i>In a corner of the dawn sky</i>

833
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,720
<i>Another star appears</i>
<i>in the weeping woods.</i>

834
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:28,700
<i>In the blink of an eye,</i>
<i>right above my head</i>

835
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,170
<i>Pouring down like rain</i>

836
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,310
<i>A beautiful day</i>

837
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,980
<i>Even the sun and the moon</i>
<i>are on my side</i>

838
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,580
<i>Shining just for me</i>

839
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,180
<i>Oh, please love me</i>

840
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:55,660
<i>In my empty heart</i>

841
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,360
<i>It's full of stars</i>

842
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Thank you.
It's been a while since I performed,

843
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,650
so I don't feel like leaving yet.

844
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,380
How about I take a request?

845
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,990
All right, let's see...

846
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,220
You! The lady in the middle!

847
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,270
Yes, you in the pink jacket,
the one looking around!

848
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,900
Yes? Me?

849
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,070
Yes, you. Do you have a request?

850
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,940
A request for what?

851
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,080
No pressure.
Just say whatever comes to mind.

852
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,020
For some reason,
I'm just so curious to know...

853
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,650
what your taste in music is.

854
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,920
Seriously, what's his problem?

855
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:04,460
Or you could ask for an encore
of the song I just sang. It's fine.

856
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:09,060
I'm so broke I can't even afford
my streaming service, you jerk.

857
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,960
My mind's a total blank.

858
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,300
A request...

859
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,500
A song request.

860
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,210
A song request.

861
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,640
"Southbound Train," please.

862
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,280
"Southbound Train?" Seriously?

863
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,910
A train?

864
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,550
What train?

865
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
South...

866
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,690
"Southbound Train?"

867
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,160
He just put me on the spot.

868
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,660
"Southbound Train."

869
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,800
You got it.

870
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,630
Darn it.

871
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,740
Why did I have to think
of that song?

872
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,370
Her taste is really something.
"Southbound Train."

873
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,770
Goodness.

874
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,560
<i>On the rainy Honam Line</i>

875
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,330
<i>On the southbound train</i>

876
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:19,500
<i>Through the rattling windowpane</i>

877
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,540
<i>The raindrops streak and run</i>

878
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,870
<i>And so do my tears</i>

879
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,210
<i>My lost first love washes away</i>

880
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,610
It stuck.

881
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,050
Yoon Hwan! Hey!

882
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,280
Are you okay? Hey!

883
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,320
Somebody call 911! Hey!

884
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,860
- Is he okay?
- Yoon Hwan!

885
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,490
Hey!

886
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,290
Are you okay? Oh gosh!

887
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,830
(Emergency Care Center)

888
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,270
- What should I do? What do I do?
- What?

889
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,930
Are you all right?

890
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,040
Do I look all right to you?

891
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,970
What an unlucky day.

892
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,850
If you give me your bank account,
I'll help with your medical bills...

893
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,450
So the kind of person...

894
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,760
who requests "Southbound Train"
in a Hongdae club...

895
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,130
must have a thing
for guys like that.

896
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,330
Excuse me?

897
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:57,900
And do me a favor. Don't go around
saying you like my music, okay?

898
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,230
What are you talking about?

899
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,940
It's just that your taste in general
seems a bit...

900
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,240
A bit what?

901
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,240
Lousy.

902
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,410
- Excuse me?
- For you to like my music...

903
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,580
I'm not sure how to feel about that.

904
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,420
Feel what?

905
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,380
Not right.

906
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,250
- Listen.
- From now on,

907
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,220
just say you have no taste.

908
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,320
I'm not judging.

909
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,560
I just think it'd be better for you.
Just some friendly advice.

910
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,660
I'm off.

911
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,800
And about your friend's
medical bill...

912
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,540
Just send me the bill. All right?

913
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,650
Hey!

914
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,990
I have my own taste.

915
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,520
Excuse me?

916
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,260
- I'm just broke.
- What?

917
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,200
Do you even know what taste is?

918
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,740
It's about finding that one thing
that truly speaks to you among many.

919
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,370
And do you know
how you find that one thing?

920
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,870
By trying new things.

921
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:18,180
You keep trying things over and over
to find what's perfect for you.

922
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:21,480
But people like me with no money,
can't do that.

923
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,120
You know why?
Because we can't afford to fail.

924
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,690
Opportunities to try new things
aren't just lying around for us.

925
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,120
You're talking too fast.

926
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,590
But even in this pathetic life,
when I say I like something,

927
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,030
it's for real.

928
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,900
It's not to be taken lightly.

929
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,730
What I'm saying is,
all the new phones are so beautiful,

930
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,370
Then you should go sell phones
in Yongsan.

931
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,240
And cream coffee
is seriously delicious.

932
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,840
Sure, and Americanos
are delicious, too.

933
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,840
And your music
is genuinely good, too!

934
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,320
Even if you're a mean-spirited,
rotten person,

935
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,150
your song is just that good!

936
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,060
You don't know anything. Jerk.

937
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,110
I missed my flight.

938
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,940
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, watch it!

939
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,240
Seriously...

940
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,150
Ji Song? Gosh...

941
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,620
Gosh.

942
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,360
Give it here.
Why are you looking at this, Mr. Oh?

943
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,190
No, I wasn't looking at it.

944
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,660
I was just picking it up for you.

945
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,040
I should've gone today.

946
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,140
That was my only chance
to change his mind.

947
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,380
Change his mind? Whose mind?

948
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,510
Why?

949
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,080
Wei Lin's.

950
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,450
He's cheating on me!

951
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,950
Wei Lin...

952
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,650
But...

953
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,590
Wait, what are you talking about?

954
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,590
Break up with him! Right now!

955
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,800
It's easy for you to say
since it's not happening to you.

956
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,630
I'm not trying to be insensitive.

957
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,870
No. It's just that
I hate seeing you treated this way.

958
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,510
Ji Song. I really like you.

959
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,150
What? That came out of nowhere.

960
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,450
I'd like you
even if you had smelly feet.

961
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,490
Smelly feet?

962
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:50,060
Yes. Even if you went to a bar
and ordered ridiculously overpriced,

963
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,970
totally bland canned peaches,
I'd still like you.

964
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,140
And even if you go to a bakery
and poke all the bread...

965
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,710
you have no intention of buying...

966
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,940
Wait a second!

967
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,180
What's with these cringey habits?
Are you saying I'm like that?

968
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,980
No. Even if you were,

969
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,080
even if you were
that kind of person,

970
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,720
I'm saying I would still like you.

971
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,620
And I would never cheat on you.

972
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,020
Why?

973
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,560
Because you're you.

974
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,160
I can put up with anything.

975
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,570
Ji Song, where are you going?

976
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,410
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Me?

977
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,050
My feet don't stink,
and I don't order peaches at a bar.

978
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,920
But this, right here...

979
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,190
I'm the type of girl who sees this
and just has to pull it.

980
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,320
What?

981
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,360
Do you still think
you can handle it?

982
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,000
Ji Song, calm down.
You're getting a little worked up.

983
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,830
- First, let's just talk about this.
- You said you'd put up with it.

984
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,130
Ji Song.

985
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,340
- You'll really put up with it?
- Oh, don't!

986
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:09,310
This is a brand-new car!

987
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,020
Don't just tolerate things,
Assistant Manager Oh.

988
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:19,820
Yes?

989
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,720
You can put up with other things,
but when it comes to your love life,

990
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,930
you should be with someone you adore
instead of settling.

991
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:29,860
Why should love be about enduring?
Why compromise on your type?

992
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,430
I refuse to live like that.

993
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,910
Then what's your type, Ji Song?

994
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,010
Let me try to guess.

995
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,940
You can't.

996
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,710
Well... I'll try.

997
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,780
I'm supposed to be guessing,
but I can't even think of anything.

998
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:49,980
Someone handsome!

999
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:54,050
I don't care about anything else.
They just have to be very handsome!

1000
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,990
Oh...

1001
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,010
- Mr. Oh, are you crying?
- No, I'm not.

1002
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,010
But you are. You're crying.

1003
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,340
Is it because of me?

1004
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,280
No, it's not that.

1005
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,950
I saw my face
in the rearview mirror,

1006
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,920
and I'm just so ugly.

1007
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:29,090
There's ugly,
but I'm just absurdly ugly.

1008
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:35,300
I'm so sorry.

1009
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,460
Oh, Ji Song.

1010
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:41,500
I'm so sorry
I only like handsome guys.

1011
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,140
No, it's okay.
Ji Song, please don't cry.

1012
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:52,650
- I'll turn the heater down a notch.
- Okay.

1013
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,820
Take care.

1014
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,120
- Hello.
- The item?

1015
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,160
Excuse me?

1017
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,300
Thank you.

Thank you...

1020
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,470
Oh, by any chance,

1021
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,840
are you selling
the leftovers for cheap?

1022
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,240
What?

1023
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:27,680
It was supposed to rain today,
but it didn't,

1024
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,850
so I took a huge loss.

1025
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,950
I've got to make it up somehow.

1026
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,520
Does anyone need an umbrella?

1027
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,860
I've got every color.

1028
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,130
I'm not sure what you mean.

1029
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,700
It's okay. Never mind.

1031
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,340
Fancy seeing you here.

1032
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,510
I didn't expect to see you here.

1033
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,010
Oh, you know.

1034
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,140
I was just in the neighborhood.

1035
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,780
You came for the freebies,
didn't you?

1036
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:04,150
- Of course you are.
- Yes.

I can get a good price for them

Or you could just buy it from me
right now.

1039
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:12,990
You really haven't changed a bit.

1040
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,560
Why? You got a problem with it?

1041
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,730
No problem,

1042
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,870
but I hold
a little grudge against you.

1043
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,200
We were starting
a business together,

1044
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,900
and you ghosted me
only five years ago.

1045
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,240
I was counting on you,
and I lost everything because of it.

1046
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,280
So it's only natural for me
to hold a grudge, right?

1047
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,840
And?

1048
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,650
Didn't I pay you back?

1049
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,550
The money you invested.
I paid you back every last cent.

1050
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,620
Hey, was it just about the money?

1051
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,260
What about all the time I wasted?

1052
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,060
Fine.

1053
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,390
I'm sorry.

1054
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,030
I am, but...

1055
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,930
after that, you opened
a tripe eatery and a cocktail bar.

1056
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,400
And you ruined them all, didn't you?

1057
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,870
Even if it hadn't been with me,

1058
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,670
the outcome would've been the same.

1059
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,680
What's this about
your time being so precious...

1060
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,610
that you're pinning it all on me?

1061
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,410
You've got some nerve.

1062
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,250
I'm leaving.

1063
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,050
Just help me out!

1064
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,290
What?

1065
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,060
No one's going to blame you...

1066
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,460
for being so obsessed with money.

1067
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,000
Right,
after that whole mess happened...

1068
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,440
because of some stupid money.

1069
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,110
But...

1070
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,910
if you keep acting like this,

1071
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:40,050
I'll just keep playing dumb.

1072
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,980
The cold, heartless witch
you want me to be.

1073
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,320
So just give me a break.

1074
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,920
Let me pity you in peace, will you?

1075
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,410
I'm sorry.

1076
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,920
I lost my temper earlier.

1077
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,760
I keep forgetting.

1078
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,160
I'm in no position...

1079
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,430
to dare...

1080
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,370
get angry at anyone.

1081
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,440
I sincerely apologize.

1082
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,220
You quit?

1083
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:51,820
Of course.

1084
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,290
You must be busy.

1085
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,690
You have to make money.

1086
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,560
I have to make a lot of money too.

1087
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,470
On that note,
how about a little cheer?

1088
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,870
Go,
Korea Meteorological Administration!

1089
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,210
And go, Kang Eun Sang!

1090
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,450
(Black garlic extract)

1091
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,620
(Jung Da Hae)

1092
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:34,860
- Hello?
- Hey.

1093
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,130
- Just do it.
- I haven't even said anything yet.

1094
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,100
I said, just do it.

1095
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,940
If it works out, great.

1096
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,910
If it doesn't, so what?

1097
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,240
You can just start over.

1098
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,380
You know.

1099
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,680
If you do nothing...

1100
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,580
Nothing happens.

1101
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,220
Yes.

1102
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,050
I know.

1103
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:00,650
I do.

1104
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,030
(Cancel savings account)

1105
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,580
(Cancel)

1106
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:31,080
(Are you sure you want to cancel
your savings account?)

1107
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,490
(Your account is canceled)

1108
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,810
(Confirm Enderium buy order)

1109
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,780
"Taste" is just
where your heart leads you.

1110
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,490
Wei Lin, you seriously...

1111
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:07,820
You cheater.

1112
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:11,490
If you cheat, I die, you die.

1113
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,790
Everybody dies. Okay?

1114
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,730
No! Don't worry.

1115
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,700
You're the only one for me, Ji Song.

1116
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,100
Trust me.

1117
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:22,540
Look.
I even bought this for us to share.

1118
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,240
Some hearts fall for good looks,
no matter what.

1119
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,160
While others are fixed on a past
they can't change.

1120
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:03,410
(Buy order successfully placed)

1121
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,440
(Enderium)

1122
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,220
So where is my heart headed
right now?

1123
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:29,940
Just browsing again today?

1124
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Nope.

1125
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,270
I'll choose this one.

1126
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,080
This place is just my style.

1127
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,710
Right now,
my heart is aiming for the moon.

1128
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,920
Reaching for that
high, dazzling moon.

1129
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,600
I've only ever admired them
from a distance.

1130
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,200
The things that were truly my taste
that I thought I could never have.

1131
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:04,600
Now, I refuse to give up
on any of them.

1132
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,880
So what other choice do I have?

1133
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:23,690
I guess I'll...

1134
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,530
make some real money.

1135
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:33,200
(To the Moon)

1136
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,290
(We thank Roh Jeong Eui,
Kang Tae Oh, Zhang Hao...)

1137
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,260
(for their special appearances.)

1138
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,490
Hey, isn't that Da Hae?

1139
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,560
Hey, what do you think you're doing,
drunk again?

1140
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,800
"Betrayed by the Mosaic?"

1141
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,000
- "Motel Girl's Real Face Exposed."
- Wait a minute.

1142
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,070
My phone isn't working.

1143
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,100
I complained on the station's board.

1144
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:11,870
This is Reporter Kim So Young.

1145
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,740
How have you been, ma'am?

1146
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,340
Look, an uncensored photo
just surfaced.

1147
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,410
That's not Da Hae.

1148
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,280
You know, Ji Song,
you're kind of creeping me out.

1149
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,680
Why do you keep messing with me?

1150
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,850
Can I help you?

1151
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,020
Who are you?

1152
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,250
Who did you make
that huge mistake with?

1153
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,850
There's something I'm curious about.
Mind if I ask?

1154
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,990
Dr. Han, we are at the company.

1155
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,300
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
