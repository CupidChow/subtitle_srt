1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,310
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,540
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,910
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,460
You coming to?

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,530
Da Hae?

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,560
Wait, this is a dream, right?

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,870
What? How'd you know right away?

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,540
Well, because you're spouting
a bunch of gibberish.

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,510
And there are subtitles
appearing everywhere.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Hold on.

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,780
You could've just left it.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,210
(Korean)

13
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,410
There.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,780
Here I was, hoping to be trilingual,
at least in my dream.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,620
Are we on a tour or something?

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,290
Are we going on another trip?

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,990
A trip? As if.

18
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,720
Good morning, passengers.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,760
Thank you for riding with us today.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,400
Eun Sang? What are you doing here?

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,870
- Our train...
- What is this?

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,700
- Is she cosplaying or something?
- departs our miserable reality...

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,500
where labor is not valued.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,270
We are now en route to the moon,
our final destination.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
The moon?

26
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,810
However, due to rapidly changing
economic conditions...

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,420
and the plummeting KOSPI, KOSDAQ,
and NASDAQ,

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,680
our train is now headed
away from its destination...

29
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,950
and is now bound for Crash Station.

30
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,960
What's going on?

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,890
The market's rebound is uncertain.

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,730
Due to the nature of Crash Station,

33
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,330
the train may experience
severe turbulence,

34
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,470
so please be cautious.

35
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,070
From now on,
only those who hang on will survive.

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,910
From this moment, our train
is scheduled to plunge endlessly.

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,780
All passengers are advised
to hold on for dear life.

38
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,950
I want to get off.

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,320
As for the exits,

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,060
they are nonexistent.

41
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,130
- What?
- Seatbelt.

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,970
Ji Song.

43
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,670
See you at rock bottom.

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,640
No!

45
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,900
(Enderion)

46
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,470
That crypto train is really
something else.

47
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,340
I just started,
and I'm already having nightmares?

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,360
No!

49
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,480
(Episode 7:
The Art of Buying the Dip)

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,210
As if it'd be up already.

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,220
Good morning.

52
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,130
Thanks for the food.

53
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,470
Oh, Lord.

54
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,710
Since I took in this little lamb
who spent money like water…

55
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,840
to have no shelter nor direction,

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,940
it...

57
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,280
In any case,
it has been quite a while.

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Amen.

59
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,750
And yet, this little lamb
isn't content with just his room.

60
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,760
For she does not clean up
her own dishes,

61
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,830
nor does she once lift a finger
to vacuum.

62
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,340
She takes one shower
and makes the bathroom a water park.

63
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,500
- Hey, Kim Ji Song.
- Her abuse of the AC and heating...

64
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,810
will contribute greatly
to this month's rising utility bill.

65
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,750
I ought to roast you on a skewer,
but even that wouldn't satisfy me.

66
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,220
Please forgive me,
for I have sinned.

67
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,760
But with my great benevolence,
I shall forgive you this once.

68
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,860
Amen.

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,500
Hurry up and eat.

70
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,340
About the crypto...

71
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,180
It dropped more since yesterday.

72
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,150
You're sure it's going to be okay?

73
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,880
Don't worry.

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,820
A drop in crypto...

75
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,490
means it's the perfect time
to buy more.

76
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,760
We don't work this hard for nothing.

77
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,700
It's because our salaries
aren't enough.

78
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,370
Here you go! Clean plates!

79
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,300
When the bull market comes,
you can only watch from the side.

80
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,440
You have to buy...

81
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,910
at the dip so you're laughing
when it blooms.

82
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,150
Let's just tough it out
a bit longer.

83
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,910
A brighter future awaits.

84
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,520
Let's go!

85
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,990
I appreciate the pep talk, but...

86
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,420
Still, don't you think
this is a bit much?

87
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,630
What, you thought trading crypto was
a walk in the park?

88
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,130
- Kind of?
- No matter how you live your life,

89
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,170
- life is just a freaking grind.
- life is just a freaking grind.

90
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,670
Let's go.

91
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,540
Gosh, why is it doing this again?
Why won't it work?

92
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,010
Gosh, seriously.

93
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
What?

94
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,780
(Ham Ji Woo)

95
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,850
What are you doing?

96
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,320
I told you, it was a business trip.
I'm not going for fun.

97
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,460
What? Seriously,
I'm going to Saudi Arabia,

98
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,930
and you're asking your son
to run an errand for you?

99
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,230
It's not that I won't do it, but...

100
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,470
Yes.

101
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,370
Right.

102
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,540
I'm sorry if it came off that way.

103
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,340
Okay.

104
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,550
(Jung Da Hae)

105
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,150
Okay, got it. The 24th at 7:00 p.m.

106
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,920
Got it. Okay.

107
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,190
Why would I sound happy?

108
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,190
Every day is
just the same old thing.

109
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,430
- Okay, I get it.
- I'm hanging up now, Mom. Bye.

110
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Yes, hello?

111
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,460
Did you enjoy the movie?

112
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,730
What?

113
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,060
- Yes.
- I see.

114
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
So what part did you like the most?

115
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,500
Well...

116
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,400
The part where the father...

117
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,040
said he'd sacrifice everything
for his children.

118
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,680
A line like that was really moving.

119
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
It really tugged at my heartstrings.

120
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,410
But that's from the commercial
they played...

121
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,550
before the movie started.

122
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,220
You must've been really moved
by that insurance ad.

123
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,090
So a sacrificing father
was the wrong answer.

124
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

125
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,360
I wanted to see you just for a bit
before my trip,

126
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,900
and I barely managed to get away.

127
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,300
I'm so sorry.

128
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,340
I was just so tired.

129
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Why?

130
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,310
Is something wrong...

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,840
Is this about that incident?

132
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,210
What?

133
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,380
What incident?

134
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,850
Oh...

135
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
(Hoppang Bite)

136
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,260
If I look suspicious now,
I'm done for.

137
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,470
Oh! Wait, hold on!

138
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,300
- Gosh...
- Jung Da Hae...

139
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,970
- What are you two doing?
- What?

140
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,340
What are you doing? Are you insane?

141
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,210
It's not what it looks like.

142
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,410
My hair got caught
on Dr. Ham's button.

143
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,820
So that's the excuse
we're going with.

144
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,950
What were you doing
to get your hair caught like that?

145
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,520
Greeting him.
Yes. While I was bowing.

146
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,560
You told us, Mr. Ko,
to bow 90 degrees to our superiors.

147
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,960
I was just doing as I was taught,
and my head just had to get stuck.

148
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,830
- Right?
- She was just being respectful.

149
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,700
What are you doing?
Just cut it or fix it!

150
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,370
- I'll help you.
- No, it's okay!

151
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,710
I couldn't wash my hair yesterday,
so it probably smells pretty bad.

152
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,010
We'll take care of this in private.
Just the two of us.

153
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Right.

154
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,390
What was that? Why are Jung Da Hae
and Dr. Ham together?

155
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,750
Are they dating?

156
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,250
Are you crazy?

157
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,290
What other reason could there be?
Maybe she has some dirt on Dr. Ham?

158
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,330
No way.

159
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,290
Looks like Dr. Ham's in big trouble.

160
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,760
(Kim Tae Su)

161
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,300
- Take care.
- Just tell them that it's true.

162
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,270
- What?
- If people keep bothering you,

163
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,670
just tell them we're dating.

164
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,310
I don't mind at all.
In fact, it's more than that.

165
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,310
I actually want everyone
at the company to know.

166
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,210
Pretending to be strangers at work
is really getting on my nerves.

167
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,810
You know what?
Maybe I should just...

168
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,510
get it all out in the open myself.

169
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
I shouldn't, right?

170
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,890
Probably not. Right.

171
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,260
Just do whatever you want, Da Hae.

172
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,360
I'll follow your lead.

173
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,860
(Marron Confectionery)

174
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,970
They said it only did well at first.

175
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,730
I'm losing my mind.

176
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,740
As if I'm not exhausted enough.

177
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,310
This stupid Hoppang Bite thing
is making it even worse.

178
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm so exhausted.

179
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,580
Gosh, I tried so hard
to get the last word in on that.

180
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,010
What did you write?

181
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,650
The usual.

182
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,580
I told them I'd screenshot it all
for a defamation suit.

183
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,490
You should've threatened
to take their heads off.

184
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,390
Wait a minute.
So marketing had the wrong audience?

185
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,660
- How is this our fault?
- Then whose is it?

186
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,260
It's your fault...

187
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,830
you couldn't handle the marketing
of a visionary like me.

188
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,530
We didn't fail to keep up.

189
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,500
We refused. Because it was tacky.

190
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,540
Tacky, is it?
And I suppose you're just so classy?

191
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,610
- What?
- Calling me cheap?

192
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,770
- You want to take this outside?
- Want to go right now?

193
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
- Fine, let's go!
- Go?

194
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,440
Hey, both of you, knock it off.

195
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,340
Come on, we're all on the same team.

196
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,110
Stay out of this, old man.

197
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,820
Gosh, I hate being polite to you.

198
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,590
Why do you keep aging by the hour?

199
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,650
It's unsettling.

200
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Hey! I showed you my ID at my place
when we drank.

201
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,420
I'm a year younger than you.

202
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,860
Keep it down.
What is this? Where did we go wrong?

203
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,130
I don't know about all that,

204
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,200
but this sales drop is
not our fault.

205
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,460
We did our part.

206
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,130
And you think we didn't?

207
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,500
Jjokko Jjokko Jjong! Mellong Pong!

208
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,240
We launched a campaign and did both
online and offline promotions.

209
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,140
And I'll say it, anything is better
than that annoying "poot" sound.

210
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,840
I think just repeating the name
would've been better.

211
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,410
Jjok-ko-ko-ko-ko,
Mel-long-long-long-long.

212
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,250
No, I would've kept it simple. See?
Chocong! Melong!

213
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,550
See? Just clean and simple!

214
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,790
Look at how tacky that is.

215
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,490
It's Jjokko Jjokko! Mellong Mellong!

216
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,550
I've told you many times,
this is it.

217
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,420
Hey! That's enough. Go sit down.

218
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,860
You have to see it for yourselves.

219
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,090
Hey, Ms. Round.

220
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,860
Ms. Round, where are you?
Hey, Ms. Round!

221
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,130
Yes?

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,730
Pull up our campaign video,
will you?

223
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,800
They need to see it.

224
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,870
- Yes.
- Here, watch this.

225
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,130
- Fine, let's see it.
- Gosh, I swear...

226
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,770
(Enderion)

227
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,310
(Enderion)

228
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,950
Turn it off!

229
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,090
Turn it off.

230
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,960
What is this?

231
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,460
(Enderion)

232
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,530
Turn it off!

233
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,360
- Hey!
- What? What's wrong?

234
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,830
Turn it off!

235
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,330
(Enderion)

236
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,540
I'm so sorry.

237
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,740
Why won't it turn off?

238
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,010
- Just a minute.
- Hey!

239
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,010
Unplug it!

240
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,450
Hurry!

241
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,850
Unplug it, right!

242
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,250
Da Hae, do you invest in crypto?

243
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
Just brilliant.

244
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,490
There's always something with you.

245
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,530
Always something.

246
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,670
But how am I supposed to do
all this...

247
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,370
A pine caterpillar eats
pine needles,

248
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,040
and an employee lives
on their salary.

249
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,510
To earn your pay, you must work.

250
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,980
Those who do not work shall not eat.
Haven't you heard that?

251
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,580
With this much work,
I won't have time to eat, anyway.

252
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,380
What, no time to eat?
Then maybe you should eat less.

253
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
You eat too much. That's why
you have no time. Now, go.

254
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,020
Okay.

255
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,520
Just how much does she eat?

256
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,830
Kids these days are so greedy,
always looking to get rich quick?

257
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,960
I just can't stand to see it.

258
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,270
Tae Su, you're young.
What about you?

259
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,270
Money comes second to me.
Diligence and sincerity.

260
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,270
Right. Diligence and sincerity.
That's why I like you.

261
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,810
- Thank you.
- That's what people should be.

262
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,080
Kids these days just don't get it.
Always looking for a big score.

263
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,290
A punch is the "one shot" they need.
They've all gone mad.

264
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,060
(Memo: April 23, 67 points)

265
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,910
(Jinja, Japanese Cuisine)

266
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,640
- Oh my, her waist is so tiny.
- Gosh, darn, I'm almost late.

267
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,880
- You made it.
- Oh, goodness.

268
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,120
Did I really have
to get caught then?

269
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,420
Gosh, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just cursed this year.

270
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,490
Didn't Mr. Ko chew you out?

271
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,760
"Why are you trading crypto?"
"Trying to hit the jackpot or what?"

272
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,600
"Kids these days are too greedy,"
Yes, the nagging already started.

273
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,560
I said the same thing too.

274
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,600
Hey. You just hated crypto.

275
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,370
He hates that
I'm the one into crypto.

276
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,800
It's not the same thing at all.

277
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,570
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What do you think it means?

278
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm saying Ko Dae Young
has zero respect for me.

279
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,510
Gosh, why do you think
he nicknamed me Ms. Round?

280
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,080
Do I look even a little bit
round to you?

281
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,090
The reason
he nicknamed me Ms. Round...

282
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,790
was a teaser
to how he planned to harass me.

283
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,830
- And I didn't even realize it.
- What an absolute jerk.

284
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,830
"Jerk" isn't a strong enough word
for a guy like that.

285
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,900
He's a jerk, a pig, and a menace,
a five-alarm dumpster fire,

286
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,670
and a face you hope
to never see again.

287
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,670
This looks nice.

288
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,870
- Welcome!
- Pretty good, right?

289
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,750
We're so dead.

290
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,150
Let's sit down.

291
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,300
Gosh, this place
has a great vibe, right?

292
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,560
The night view is amazing, right?

293
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,800
Of all places, why did that jerk
have to come here?

294
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,300
You guys know we're not allowed
to have second jobs, right?

295
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,540
Remember Ms. Jin from Materials?

296
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,710
She got a three-month pay cut
for doing a web novel...

297
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,040
as a side job on a portal site.

298
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,110
Three months?

299
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,810
What kind of novel did she write?

300
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,310
An office drama, where
a subordinate takes her boss...

301
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,420
Falling in love?

302
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,850
- A romance?
- No way.

303
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,550
She deals with the devil
to kill him.

304
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,650
A fantasy.

305
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,120
Sounds more like a documentary.

306
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,860
Anyway, if they find out
we're working part-time, we're dead.

307
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,760
Mr. Ko is already on my case.

308
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,530
If he finds out about this...

309
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,630
Excuse me! We're ready to order!

310
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,300
- Go ahead and pick.
- What should we get?

311
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,270
Gosh, what's taking them so long?

312
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,840
Excuse me!

313
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,650
Are you ready to order?

314
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,990
Darn it, my feet are killing me.

315
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,020
Two of the Course A.

316
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Got it.

317
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,370
Did a delinquent
just take our order?

318
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,500
I almost gave her my lunch money.

319
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,500
Anyway, Mr. Ko,
how's work life treating you?

320
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:27,040
Let's just say the company
would fall apart without me.

321
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,140
Oh, is that right?

322
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,510
- Can I get some water?
- Yes!

323
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,820
Gosh, you startled me!

324
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,500
Here is your water.

325
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,030
Thank you.

326
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Thank you.

327
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,840
This place is full of characters.

328
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,750
What about your team? How are they?

329
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,510
What can you expect from that bunch?

330
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,520
Gosh, hey, can we order some drinks?

331
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,890
- I'm too scared to order from them.
- Excuse me. We'd like some drinks.

332
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,260
Why? Are your team members
giving you a hard time?

333
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,070
We live in an OECD member country,

334
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,430
one of
the world's top ten economies,

335
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,870
and yet these kids go all-in
on gambles like stocks and crypto.

336
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,970
If people like us built the pillars
of this economy,

337
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,950
you'd think they could get by
just by doing their jobs.

338
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,510
But those empty-headed fools
are always chasing a "One Shot."

339
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,450
They just want to hit it big!
What they need is a hit to the head.

340
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,450
Gosh. Can't stand the sight of them.

341
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,430
Hey.

342
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,760
Why'd you come back out?

343
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,160
I don't feel like
being nice to them.

344
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Go on.

345
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,670
- Excuse me, can we get a menu?
- Yes, right away.

346
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
What's wrong?

347
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,340
What's with him?

348
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,840
What is it? Are you choking?

349
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,380
Wait, what's happening?
What's wrong?

350
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,480
- Hey!
- Excuse me!

351
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,820
Sir! I need you to stand up. Get up!

352
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,890
Wait a second. What do I do?

353
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,340
I'm alive.

354
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,780
I went to the other side and back.

355
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,580
I even saw a ghost.

356
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,050
A ghost?

357
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,960
Gosh. That was a close call.

358
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,600
(Jinja, Japanese Cuisine)

359
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,270
- Good work tonight.
- You all did a great job.

360
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,970
Da Hae. Here, this is for you.

361
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,600
- What? What's this?
- It's a tip.

362
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,270
It's from that man you saved earlier.

363
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,410
He left it for you on his way out.

364
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,140
What? Mr. Ko? I mean...

365
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,110
You're telling me
that man gave her a tip?

366
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,150
Why not? She earned it.

367
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,480
- Da Hae saved his life.
- No, it was nothing.

368
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,650
- Go on, take it.
- But...

369
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,330
How much is it?

370
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,830
Come on, open it up.

371
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,660
Hey, keep it down...

372
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,460
- Five hundred dollars?
- Five hundred dollars?

373
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,370
Wait, is this for real?

374
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,170
So you're saying Mr. Ko
gave her 500 dollars as a tip?

375
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,010
- Think it's fake?
- What?

376
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,510
- Give it here. I have to return it.
- What?

377
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,580
What? Why?

378
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,840
What do you mean, "why?"
You'd take money from that jerk?

379
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,580
Money is money,
no matter the source.

380
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,950
Who cares who gave it to you?

381
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,520
That's right.
It's not like you stole it from him.

382
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,490
Mr. Ko was really drunk.

383
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,090
He couldn't have been
in his right mind.

384
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,060
Still...

385
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,560
Forget it.

386
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,760
What if he comes
and demands it back?

387
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,070
We need to return it
before this becomes a problem.

388
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,200
- How?
- How?

389
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,140
He can't find out we have side jobs.

390
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,910
And you can't just go up to him
and be like,

391
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,710
"Hey, here.
This is the tip you gave me."

392
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,440
So how will you return it
discreetly?

393
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,780
Come on. How hard can it be
to return one envelope of cash?

394
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,350
I'll get it done
before lunch tomorrow.

395
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Just you watch.

396
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,160
Gosh, Da Hae is so weird sometimes.
You know?

397
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,230
If it were me,
I'd say thank you very much...

398
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,630
and just take the money.

399
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,960
- Ji Song.
- Imagine if...

400
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,630
she'd invested in crypto.

401
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,470
Gosh. She could've taken
a break from work.

402
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,610
Ji Song.

403
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,880
Look, I really like her, you know?

404
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,010
But sometimes I worry about her.

405
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,450
How will she get by in this world,
being so stubbornly principled?

406
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,480
It's a huge problem. Huge.

407
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,320
Kim Ji Song.

408
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,460
(Electricity bill, Final Notice)

409
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,130
What do you have to say about this?

410
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,470
This month's electricity bill
is a whopping 250 dollars.

411
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,670
What do you have to say about that?

412
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,170
I don't believe
I'm responsible for that.

413
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,470
What do you mean, not you?

414
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,510
You blasted the AC
when you were hot,

415
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,580
and then you said you were cold
and turned on the electric blanket.

416
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,950
You pulled all that ridiculous crap,
and now look what happened!

417
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,690
I even gave you a room to yourself,
and this is how you repay me?

418
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,150
But...

419
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,590
- You're paying from now on.
- What?

420
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,830
Everything you eat, wear,
and use in this house...

421
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,500
I'm going to get back
every last penny from you.

422
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,630
Like my pocket change is going
to help our finances.

423
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,840
Maybe it'll help you
finally get a grip.

424
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,670
From the one who gave me
8,000 dollars for crypto?

425
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,110
You're so petty.

426
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,510
Look, as I've told you
a million times,

427
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,510
that was an investment.

428
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,880
Spending money for a future return.

429
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,780
But what you're doing is splurging.

430
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,320
Spending money for instant pleasure.

431
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,620
Those two are completely different,

432
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,120
and I have zero intention
of letting it slide.

433
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,220
So pay up.

434
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,160
That ketchup on your corn dog!
You're paying for that too!

435
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,430
- You're being so petty.
- Pay before you eat!

436
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
- I'm not paying!
- Pay up! Pay before you eat!

437
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,430
Stay away from me.

438
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
No.

439
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,560
I think I'll come right over there.

440
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,230
At least unclench your fists first!

441
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,870
Wait, Eun Sang!

442
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Hey!

443
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,240
Come on, Eun Sang!

444
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,110
Hey, you think this is funny?

445
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,990
Piece of cake.

446
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,660
How's everyone feeling today?

447
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,360
- Great!
- Great!

448
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,330
All right,
let's have an energetic day.

449
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,330
Let's go!

450
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:11,710
My goodness, look at this mess.

451
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,510
Ko Dae Young has been working hard.

452
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,580
<i>Time to shred</i>

453
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,280
<i>Everybody shred</i>

454
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,350
Mr. Ko, where are you going?

455
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,650
To toss this out. Why?

456
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,560
- Here, let me. I'll do it.
- You will, Ms. Round?

457
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,530
Yes. I actually have some things
to organize myself, so...

458
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,930
I'd like to do it.
I'll take care of it.

459
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,230
All right, then. Okay.

460
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,300
Da Hae,
can you take this for me too?

461
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
What?

462
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,140
Then, please take this as well.

463
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,610
- Thank you very much.
- Wait, hang on.

464
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,480
Let's start our meeting
when Ms. Round gets back.

465
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,050
- Understood.
- Okay.

466
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,920
I don't care what it is.

467
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,090
If you have an idea, spit it out.

468
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,020
Got it? I promise I won't get mad.

469
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,320
That's it.

470
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,460
I can slip it into his suit pocket.

471
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,730
Influencer marketing.

472
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,000
Influencers? How last year! Gosh.

473
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,500
How long are we going to keep
relying on celebrity marketing?

474
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,870
How about a pop-up store?

475
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,110
Don't you know
pop-ups are expensive?

476
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,640
What about our profit margins?

477
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,180
Don't you have any ideas?

478
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,020
Seriously,
what's wrong with you all?

479
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,590
Because our Q2 sales dropped,

480
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,660
and everyone's already
out for our blood.

481
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,160
Will you ruin
the Cocomishu launch too?

482
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,430
You all just want
to go down together?

483
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,440
Should we all just jump off
a bridge?

484
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,900
What? Why is the pocket sewn shut?

485
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,670
What?

486
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,440
What is it?

487
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,680
- What was that?
- Sorry,

488
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,190
Mr. Ko. I saw something.

489
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,090
I didn't even realize.
This jacket pocket is sewn shut.

490
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,590
Don't you know opening the pockets
ruins the silhouette?

491
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,290
I'm so sorry.

492
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,200
You think "sorry" fixes everything?
What?

493
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,830
I can't breathe in here.

494
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,240
Where are you going?

495
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,070
I'm taking a half-day.
Don't slack off while I'm gone.

496
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,540
- Ten ideas each. By tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,490
Even for a silhouette-obsessed guy,

498
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,560
his pants pockets
can't be sewn shut.

499
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,030
Gosh.

500
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,860
Gosh, that scared me.

501
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,640
Now, if I just naturally slip this
into his back pocket...

502
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,980
Darn it...

503
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Mr. Ko.

504
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,950
What was that Da Hae?
Did you just touch my butt?

505
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,450
No, I didn't.

506
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,860
What are you doing,
touching my butt?

507
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,260
No, that's not it.
The envelope just brushed against...

508
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,260
- An envelope?
- No, that's not what I meant.

509
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,530
Mr. Ko, what's with the outfit?

510
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,070
I'm going cycling. To brainstorm.
What? You got a problem with it?

511
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,000
No. That's not what I meant.

512
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,070
Gosh, Mr. Ko.
You must work out really hard.

513
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,940
The outfit looks great on you.
I guess I got too close admiring it.

514
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,410
Maybe I should follow your example
and start working out.

515
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,750
Seriously.

516
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,220
Ms. Round, when you act like this,
I'm not sure...

517
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,920
- It puts me in a tough spot.
- What does?

518
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,060
When you come on to me like this,
what am I supposed to do?

519
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,130
You don't have to do
anything in particular.

520
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,260
But this is the office!
You can't just touch my butt.

521
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,070
No, it's not like I was trying to...

522
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,700
I wasn't trying to touch you...

523
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,520
How old is she?

524
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,350
Excuse me?

525
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,760
What are you talking about?

526
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,660
No, I mean your daughter, Eun Sang.

527
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,930
I'm asking how old she is.

528
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,990
Excuse me?

529
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,660
I've been going
back and forth on it.

530
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,200
What with the doll on your monitor,

531
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,470
and that character keychain
you always have with you.

532
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,300
Seeing that, I thought you had
a kid my daughter's age.

533
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,670
But then,
you never talk about your family,

534
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,340
so I wasn't entirely sure.

535
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,110
But lately,
I'm pretty sure my hunch is right.

536
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,580
This screams
"little daughter," right?

537
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,520
This is a ketchup stain.

538
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,750
It just wouldn't come out
in the wash.

539
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,120
- So how old is your daughter?
- She's six.

540
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,460
She's the cutest now.

541
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,590
Sounds like she and Ji Song
have the same mental age.

542
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,060
Here, take that.

543
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,630
My daughter used to love this.

544
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,300
But now she won't even look at it.

545
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,870
I thought of you,

546
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,370
- so I brought it just for you.
- I couldn't possibly...

547
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,470
No, you have to take it.
They don't make these anymore,

548
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,470
so it's being resold at a premium.

549
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,910
It's a collector's item,
so please...

550
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,540
give it to your daughter, all right?

551
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,450
- Okay?
- Yes.

552
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,460
Hair part.

553
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,500
Sideburns. Neat. Idol contacts.

554
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,630
Necktie.

555
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,170
Belt.

556
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,500
New glasses.

557
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,940
All right. Let's do this.

558
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,510
It keeps dropping.

559
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,280
Gosh. Is it right to keep investing?

560
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,830
Ji Song,
you haven't left for lunch yet?

561
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,560
Yes, I don't have an appetite.

562
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,800
Hey, Ji Song. My hair...

563
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,470
Are you okay?

564
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,570
What?

565
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,040
No, that's not it.
Then what about my eyes?

566
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,980
- Are you in pain or something?
- No.

567
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,980
- Then how about my nose...
- What is it? What?

568
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,100
What happened to your nose?

569
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,070
Did you get punched?

570
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,710
No. I felt like sprucing myself up.

571
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
You what?

572
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,010
Why all of a sudden?

573
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,880
My goodness, Mr. Oh, what happened?

574
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,980
What happened to your nose?

575
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,050
- Don't tell me you got fillers.
- What?

576
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,720
Is that what I got? Filler?

577
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,660
Oh my gosh, what's all this?
You really got work done?

578
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,930
But why?

579
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,500
I just...

580
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,770
Don't tell me
it's because of Ji Song.

581
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,470
- What?
- No, it's nothing like that.

582
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,240
Now that's true love.
That's what I call true love.

583
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,770
Ji Song.

584
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,210
Just give Assistant Manager Oh
a chance already.

585
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,380
Where else are you going to find
a guy this devoted to you?

586
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,610
Hey!

587
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,350
Ji Song,

588
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,390
I really don't want to pressure you.

589
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,660
Enjoy your lunch!

590
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,890
It's lunchtime.

591
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,970
But...

592
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,670
Ji Song.

593
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,170
Just give up already.
I've never seen anyone so rude.

594
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,010
Gosh, Assistant Manager Jo,
you need to stop.

595
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,980
I'm just...

596
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,610
It's my own choice to like her.

597
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,650
Why are you calling Ji Song rude?

598
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,750
For goodness' sake.

599
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,520
Unbelievable.

600
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,760
- A secondhand site?
- Yes.

601
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,060
It's a limited edition item,
so I can sell it for a lot more.

602
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,030
Then why not keep it?
It's so pretty.

603
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,640
I'd rather not.
It'll just be a painful reminder.

604
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,710
What about you?

605
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,740
What?

606
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,180
What were you saying yesterday?
About the envelope being easy?

607
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,580
You said you'd have it
all sorted out before lunch?

608
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,550
How was I to know the pocket
on his suit was sewn shut?

609
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,820
How could I know that jerk would
suddenly change into cycling gear?

610
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,160
Why don't you ask the restaurant
for help?

611
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,400
Ask the owner to give it back
to him for you.

612
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,060
I already tried calling.

613
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,670
But apparently, Mr. Ko
already called the restaurant.

614
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,370
He wants to buy a meal
for his savior...

615
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,270
and is coming back soon.

616
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,670
He doesn't seem like the type
to be so proper about things.

617
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,680
I don't know.
If he shows up, I can't avoid him.

618
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,050
My cover will be blown.

619
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,150
So why are you trying so desperately
to give it back?

620
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,280
If it were me, I'd invest in crypto.

621
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,520
Just imagine if you doubled it.

622
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,320
I like that go-getter attitude
of yours.

623
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,730
- Now you spill.
- What? Spill what?

624
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,290
I mean it, why are you
trying so desperately?

625
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,300
Is there a reason you won't tell us
why you must return that money?

626
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,540
No, of course
there's no special reason.

627
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,440
I just don't want to take
a single penny from Mr. Ko.

628
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,170
My sacred crypto portfolio...

629
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,110
can't be tainted
by someone like Ko Dae Young.

630
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,480
Who cares if you don't want to?
You need to have a way to do it.

631
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,810
There has to be a way.

632
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,120
I'll wait for a chance
and stuff it in his bag.

633
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,590
Right. I really hope you succeed.

634
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,860
But hey,

635
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,030
why do those people keep whispering?

636
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,140
Do you think Da Hae and Dr. Ham
are for real?

637
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,570
Come on.
As if Dr. Ham would be interested.

638
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,880
But who on earth is Hoppang Bite?

639
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,010
Whoever it is seems to know
everyone's business.

640
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,610
It's creeping me out.

641
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,950
Come on,
it's likely another employee.

642
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,080
What's there to be scared of?

643
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,890
You have nothing to hide, right?
Tell us.

644
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,190
You've never even swiped
a coffee mix...

645
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,660
from the break room, have you?

646
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,230
What on earth are you talking about,
coffee mix?

647
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,830
Da Hee doesn't want for anything
in this world.

648
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,260
That's not exactly true.

649
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,570
Have you guys heard?
There's a new office couple in HR.

650
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,040
I'll take this.

651
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,610
- It helps cleanse your system.
- Here, have some of mine.

652
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,310
- I don't like it.
- Let's go.

653
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,580
(Haha leaves first.)

654
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,350
Can you do a lower price?

655
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,690
Isn't it a bit rude to ask that
without even a hello?

656
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,290
My apologies.

657
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,530
Hello. Can you do a lower price?

658
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,900
No. As you can tell,
it's discontinued,

659
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,800
so it commands a premium price
on the resale market.

660
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,210
I see.

661
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,640
So, is the price negotiable?

662
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,080
What is your deal?

663
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,010
If you're not going to buy it,
I'm moving on to the next person.

664
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,650
Gosh, we can't have that.

665
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,920
Can you tell me about its condition?
Are there any scratches?

666
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,490
No.

667
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,930
I'm fine with scratches.
So you can't give me a discount?

668
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,790
This cheapskate is a real psycho.

669
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm home.

670
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,270
Hey. Where were you?

671
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,070
What's that?

672
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,540
I got a gig for early tomorrow.

673
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm promoting a new store's opening.

674
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,640
- Ta-da!
- The things you do.

675
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,080
You've got to earn what you can
while you're young.

676
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,980
How else can we pay for water
and heat in this house, right?

677
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,890
Did you put a password on the Wi-Fi?

678
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,390
That'll be 50 cents
for the Internet.

679
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,130
Gosh, you're so cheap!

680
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,360
I'll put it on your tab.

681
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,400
That stings.

682
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Gosh, blood...

683
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,020
Is there a first-aid kit
around here?

684
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,440
"Refund complete?"

685
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,100
(Marron Confectionery)

686
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,370
A formal complaint?

687
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,810
Against me? Wait, who filed it?

688
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,670
The complaint was filed anonymously.

689
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,850
We can't ignore a sensitive matter,
so we asked to meet with you.

690
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,950
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

691
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,620
Is this about that post
on the company message board?

692
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,680
Excuse me?

693
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,650
That thing...

694
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,890
It's not even true, but...

695
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,360
Even if it were, what's wrong with
two consenting adults dating?

696
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,730
Their different positions
don't matter.

697
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,970
It's a different story
if the relationship is one-sided.

698
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,500
It's not that one-sided.

699
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,970
Have you had any unneeded
physical contact with Mr. Ko?

700
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,280
Mr. Ko?

701
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,610
Yes, here was a time I made contact,
but it was necessary.

702
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,520
Was the contact intentional?

703
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,090
- I can't say it was unintentional.
- And was your intent inappropriate?

704
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,830
What are you implying?

705
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,160
Ms. Jung Da Hae.

706
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,730
Let me ask you directly.

707
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,740
Do you have feelings for Mr. Ko?

708
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:48,550
Do you have feelings for Mr. Ko?

709
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Ms. Jung Da Hae?

710
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,660
I'm sorry.

711
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,800
I was just considering jumping
out the window.

712
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,830
Mr. Ko, are you okay?

713
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,740
Gosh, you must have been so upset
to file a formal complaint.

714
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,570
It's a curse to be this handsome.

715
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,480
That's why I got married early.

716
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,110
I swear.

717
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,680
I didn't think that
as a married man,

718
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,910
I'd still set women's hearts ablaze.

719
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,090
You guys keep a close eye
on Ms. Round.

720
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:31,160
Her crypto rambling was pathetic.
Got it?

721
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,290
Yes, sir. Understood.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.

722
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,130
We'll keep a close eye on Da Hae.
Gosh, you scared me!

723
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,030
Da Hae.

724
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
Da Hae.

725
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,280
Mr. Ko,

726
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,120
we need to talk.

727
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,970
What's this? Why are you clapping?

728
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,940
It's all thanks to you.

729
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,440
Our country's consistent
number one ranking...

730
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,050
among OECD nations
in this category...

731
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,220
is all thanks to you, Mr. Ko.

732
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,380
And what category is that?

733
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,520
- The suicide rate.
- What?

734
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,120
I just came from
the grievance committee.

735
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,590
I almost jumped out the window
because I was so furious.

736
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,490
So what's your point?

737
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,030
My point?

738
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,230
If anyone should be called
in for questioning,

739
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,300
it should be you, not me.

740
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,370
I wasn't trying to touch you.

741
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,480
I was trying to give you back
your tip.

742
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,190
Then the person who saved me...

743
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,220
Yes. I was the one who saved you
that day.

744
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,460
And I was also the one...

745
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,230
who saw you selling off
secret company documents.

746
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,300
Selling them off?
What? What did you see?

747
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,240
- Gosh.
- Mr. Ko! Wait. Hold on.

748
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,540
What?

749
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,870
One moment, please.

750
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,450
- You're so clumsy. What is this?
- Is something on me?

751
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,980
Gosh, walking around
with that stain on you.

752
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,050
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I told you not to do this.

753
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,420
Even the product development plan!

754
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,790
Come on,
it's just a little something.

755
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,320
Okay? It's really not much.

756
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,160
Just take it.
Think of it as my appreciation.

757
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,260
What you saw was a misunderstanding.
I was just advising a junior.

758
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,670
You think I got a huge payout?

759
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,940
I'm not greedy like you, Ms. Round.
I'm not greedy like that.

760
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,710
What's wrong with me
being a little ambitious?

761
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,640
You get to be as greedy as you want,

762
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,210
so why is it wrong
when I invest in crypto?

763
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,380
Even if I invest in crypto
or anything else,

764
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,380
aren't my hands
still cleaner than yours?

765
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,520
There you go again, Ms. Round!

766
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,740
You know what?

767
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,680
I used to look up to you.

768
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,250
Your work style drove me nuts,

769
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,220
but there were things I respected.

770
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,090
And even though I acted like
I didn't care,

771
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,990
I still worked harder...

772
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,790
because I wanted you
to praise me, just once.

773
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,900
That was Ms. Kang...

774
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,400
You're a hard worker.

775
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,240
I like what I see. Keep it up.

776
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,810
- Good night.
- Yes.

777
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,310
But you always said
it wasn't enough,

778
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,350
so I poured everything I had
into the work.

779
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,980
My time.

780
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,720
My passion. My effort.

781
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,090
All of my diligence.

782
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,390
Can't you do better than this?

783
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,200
If you can't do it right,
try harder!

784
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,660
It's not that hard. Just do it!
There's no magic formula!

785
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,900
You just have to tackle it head-on.

786
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,440
You may think it's all worthless,

787
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,470
but they were my everything.

788
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,040
Not to my own mother,

789
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:44,080
not to a friend or a boyfriend,
but to my boss at work.

790
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,980
I gave more of myself to you
than to anyone.

791
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,390
So please,
just understand one thing.

792
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,090
You...

793
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,930
were someone's first role model
when they started their career.

794
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,060
And a role model is
supposed to give,

795
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,200
not take away.

796
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,540
So please.

797
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,680
Whatever tiny shred of
passion I have left,

798
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,010
please don't take that away
from me, too.

799
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,220
I'm begging you.

800
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,920
Please don't take it from me.

801
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,660
Please.

802
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,160
Please. Okay?

803
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,770
Wait...

804
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,190
("Shooting Star")

805
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,220
(I missed you so much today!)

806
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,260
(Don't you miss me, Dr. Ham?)

807
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,090
(Come back soon.
I have much to tell you.)

808
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,060
This one is worth 100 points.

809
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,990
Dr. Ham,

810
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,500
is Saudi Arabia on Mars
or Venus or something?

811
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,660
He won't call or text.

812
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,340
That's cold.

813
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,710
Are you badmouthing me
when I'm not around?

814
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,400
I missed you.

815
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,870
I missed you, too.

816
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,750
I was worried about you.

817
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,250
I thought maybe because
of that online post,

818
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,120
you might be feeling hurt.

819
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,620
And you didn't seem to feel well
before I left on my trip.

820
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:46,860
Not really.

821
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,430
And I wasn't feeling well
because of something else.

822
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,400
What was it?

823
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,070
- I got a side job.
- You did? Why?

824
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,640
Why else would I get a side job?
To make money, obviously.

825
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,940
But you get a salary.
Is it not enough?

826
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,280
It's more than enough for someone...

827
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,310
who gets a bonus of 500,000 dollars,
right?

828
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,120
I wasn't being sarcastic.
I was joking.

829
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,160
Seriously, I was just kidding.

830
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,830
Isn't work tough?

831
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,400
Of course it is.

832
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,330
Getting paid
just seven dollars an hour...

833
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:30,500
to work two, even three jobs,
is by no means easy.

834
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,910
But still,
I have a goal I'm working toward.

835
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,050
What's wrong?

836
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,720
I feel a little left out.

837
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,320
With your writing or your job,
while you're having a hard time,

838
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,690
I can't even be there for you.

839
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,390
And on top of that,

840
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,090
you're the type
to just power through...

841
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:54,630
everything on your own.

842
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,160
So...

843
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,370
that leaves nothing for me to do,
does it?

844
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,370
Hold on.

845
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,380
Here.

846
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,250
April 23.
Tae Su gave everyone donuts but me.

847
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:18,180
Kim Ji Song said I gained weight.
67 points.

848
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,490
April 24. Mr. Ko nagged me.

849
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,760
Seventy-seven points.
April 25, today.

850
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,700
Mr. Ko was hard on me again.
99 points.

851
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,300
On second thought,
this one's 100. A perfect 100.

852
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,070
What is all this?

853
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,410
I wrote down everything
that upset me...

854
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,540
so I could tell you the worst one
when I saw you.

855
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,110
And since today's score
is 100 points,

856
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,420
this is the most upsetting
moment yet.

857
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,560
Right now,

858
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,600
I'm not being very strong, am I?

859
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,900
So right now, I'm...

860
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,640
letting you see my vulnerable side,
you know?

861
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:15,810
So...

862
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,580
Then do something if you need to.

863
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,580
I should keep it closed.

864
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,750
- Do what?
- My mouth.

865
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,010
Hi there, please take one of these.
Thank you.

866
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,910
Hello, our store is now open.
Thank you.

867
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,620
What? Gosh, it dropped again.

868
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,330
Hello! Please take one. Thank you!

869
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,830
Hello! Our store is now open!

870
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,170
You could've...

871
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,200
For crying out loud...

872
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,610
Assistant Manager Oh?

873
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:01,980
Gosh.

874
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,050
Gosh, why is he picking them up?

875
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,750
Here you go.

876
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,020
Here you go.

877
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,890
Here.

878
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,930
Gosh, some people.

879
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,900
They really shouldn't throw away
your flyers like this.

880
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,530
The earth is in so much pain.

881
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,300
Just like my big, strawberry nose.

882
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,970
- Gosh, seriously.
- It hurts, I'm telling you.

883
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,970
- I think his nose got even bigger.
- What?

884
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,210
I know someone who
sounds a lot like you.

885
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,450
Our Ji Song.

886
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,890
That's got nothing to do with me.

887
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:44,790
If you've been drinking,
you'd best just go on home.

888
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,960
Then again,
you probably hate me too.

889
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,100
I get it.

890
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,630
Ji Song hates me too.

891
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,270
Because I'm ugly.

892
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,140
I'm sorry.

893
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,880
For being so ugly.

894
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,620
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm so ugly.

895
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,480
Would you stop
with the "I'm ugly" routine!

896
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,190
Ji Song?

897
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,000
I'm so sorry,
I made a complete fool of myself.

898
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:32,470
No...

899
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,110
I'm the one who should be sorry.

900
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,150
What do you have to be sorry for?

901
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,920
I hurt your feelings.

902
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
I just meant...

903
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,250
that I have a very specific type,
that's all.

904
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,090
Right, and that type is...

905
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,660
a handsome guy. Right?

906
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,030
I respect that.

907
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,140
I'm fine.

908
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,710
Okay.

909
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,980
But, by any chance...

910
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,750
I'm not trying to put you
on the spot or anything.

911
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:17,880
If, hypothetically,

912
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,620
if I got handsome,

913
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,390
- would you give me a chance?
- Nope.

914
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,460
So that's a no?

915
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:27,390
Exactly.

916
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,430
That's the problem.

917
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,470
But, Assistant Manager Oh...

918
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,940
do you like me that much?

919
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,240
Yes.

920
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,480
Yes. I mean,

921
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,680
I...

922
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,580
I have this crypto... I mean,
this personal thing going on,

923
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,550
and I'm not sure
if what I'm doing is right or wrong.

924
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,920
I'm just not that sure about it.

925
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,930
But when I look at you,
Assistant Manager Oh,

926
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,560
you seem to like me
with such unwavering conviction.

927
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,230
- I see.
- And I find that fascinating.

928
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,040
Are you always that self-assured?

929
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,070
I have faith in you, Ji Song.

930
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,810
What?

931
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,440
That someone as wonderful as you...

932
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,950
is impossible not to love.

933
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,690
So my feelings for you
can't be wrong.

934
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,720
It's not me I have faith in.
It's you.

935
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:36,730
When you can't believe in yourself,
believe in the one you love.

936
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,330
Right.
I believe in the one I love...

937
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,370
You love me?

938
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:43,970
Yes.

939
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:50,280
It's not necessarily
that kind of love.

940
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,050
Love for family,

941
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,780
or friends, or coworkers.

942
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:00,190
Yes. There are many kinds of love.

943
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:03,190
Right? That's what you meant, right?

944
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,730
Exactly.

945
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,260
That's the problem.

946
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,730
But still, Assistant Manager Oh,

947
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,370
I think you're a really good person.

948
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,370
Me?

949
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,710
Why?

950
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
I don't know, it's just...

951
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,680
It's just that with you...

952
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,850
I just get a feeling that
you'd never make me cry.

953
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,420
That's right.

954
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,490
If anything,

955
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,130
you'd be the one making me cry.

956
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,100
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not.

957
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,430
Yes, you are! You're crying again.

958
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:53,440
I'm just so moved
that you called me a good person.

959
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,580
I take back
the "good person" comment.

960
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,010
Idiot. Fool.
Kingsberry strawberry, Big Nose.

961
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,420
Shoot.

962
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,650
I really hope Eun Sang isn't asleep.

963
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,760
Ji Song, I'll take you home.

964
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,760
No, thanks. You just get home safe.
Okay?

965
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,930
See you tomorrow!

966
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,300
Get home safe.

967
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,310
Da Hae?
Can you go to Eun Sang's for me?

968
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:42,390
You came like that?
Didn't you pass any DUI checkpoints?

969
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,160
You're still up.

970
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,390
How can I sleep
when you're not back?

971
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:48,590
Thank goodness.

972
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,960
I thought you'd be asleep.

973
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,930
Why? Was I not supposed to be?

974
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:54,930
No, that's not it.

975
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,800
It's not that you
weren't supposed to be.

976
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,140
It's nothing serious.

977
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,140
All right.

978
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,340
Eun Sang.

979
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,480
What's going on?
What is it? What happened?

980
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,280
- What?
- It's nothing.

981
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,420
What's all this about?

982
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,260
What? What are you talking about?

983
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:20,960
The police in this country
must be sleeping on the job.

984
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:25,260
Letting a walking bottle of soju
and a sly fox run free.

985
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,830
What? A sly fox?
What is that supposed to mean?

986
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,100
- On your lips...
- What?

987
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,340
This...

988
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,340
is a private matter.

989
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,180
Private matters should stay private.

990
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,220
Why make it
a public spectacle? Gosh.

991
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,550
What's with you two?
Why did you all suddenly barge in?

992
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:50,560
Ji Song said that you keep
crying in your sleep,

993
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,060
so we got worried.

994
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,960
We didn't want you
to be crying all alone.

995
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,730
- What?
- I even changed...

996
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,830
my part-time shift so I could be here
when you woke up.

997
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,900
But I ran a little late today.

998
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,740
I was crying?

999
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:15,920
Don't go.

1000
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:21,550
Ji Sang. Don't go.

1001
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,790
Don't go.

1002
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,070
Ji Sang.

1003
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,070
Don't go.

1004
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,540
Don't be so dramatic.

1005
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,280
I cry at the drop of a hat.

1006
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,450
It's just menopause making me cry.
What's all the fuss about?

1007
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:25,120
Menopause or not,
how can we not be worried?

1008
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,290
That's right.

1009
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,250
When you care for someone,
you worry.

1010
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,620
Did our Eun Sang cry?

1011
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,190
Did you cry?

1012
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,130
Whatever.

1013
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,330
Here. Use this to average down.

1014
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,630
What?

1015
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:45,170
If you'd kept that money,
you would've wasted it by now.

1016
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,840
I was holding it for you
to use for averaging down.

1017
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,010
Do you think I'm crazy enough
to take rent from you?

1018
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:52,850
Eun Sang...

1019
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,150
Seriously, I'm so touched.

1020
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:58,220
Me too.

1021
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,460
Get off me! You stink.

1022
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,470
Get ready.

1023
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,410
Let's do this.

1024
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,180
(Confirm Buy?)

1025
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,750
(Your buy order has been
successfully placed.)

1026
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,730
Until now,

1027
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,830
we've all been through a lot.

1028
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:49,640
You guys were right.
Life is unforgiving.

1029
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:55,610
Still, it felt a little easier
for me this time around.

1030
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,980
Because we were together.

1031
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,850
What?

1032
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,490
I agree, though.

1033
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,060
Same here.

1034
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,960
After doing it alone, it's
so much better doing it together.

1035
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,130
It's such a relief.

1036
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,900
Let's not get...

1037
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,130
- Exhausted!
- Exhausted!

1038
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,200
Let's not.

1039
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,440
I wish I could average down
in life sometimes, too.

1040
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,540
Joyful conversations
with the ones I love,

1041
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,340
deep empathy, and the little laughs.

1042
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,710
If I could take
these warm memories...

1043
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,650
whenever life
got tough and tiring...

1044
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,950
and use them to water down the pain,

1045
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,250
how great would that be?

1046
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,190
And if the wounds in our lives...

1047
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,790
and scars could fade even a little,
how great would that be?

1048
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,370
Did the item sell?

1049
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,240
(Selling: Discontinued
Calia Dollhouse, 100 dollars)

1050
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:03,980
It hasn't sold yet.

1051
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,510
Is the price negotiable?

1052
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,620
You really have no sense of pride,
do you?

1053
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,890
With money,
saving face is pointless.

1054
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,190
It doesn't do you any good.

1055
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,760
Especially as head of a household
in the Republic of Korea.

1056
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:21,830
Do you have kids?

1057
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,960
You have them too, don't you?

1058
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,300
What makes you think I have kids?

1059
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,140
You don't? You were so nitpicky,
I got mom vibes.

1060
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,170
I was sure you had at least two.

1061
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,080
He nailed it.

1062
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,180
So, are you going to sell it or not?

1063
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:47,150
(So, are you going to sell it
or not?)

1064
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,220
I have two kids to feed,
so I guess I have to, don't I?

1065
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,820
Let's meet in person
to make the sale.

1066
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,590
How does this weekend work for you?

1067
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,330
I'll bring my kids with me.

1068
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,640
What are you doing here?

1069
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,450
It's you?

1070
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,650
You're the one buying this?

1071
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,650
You? You're the one selling this?

1072
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,390
I should've known.

1073
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,490
A cheapskate who'd do anything
to save a buck...

1074
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,100
could only be you
on this entire planet.

1075
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,830
Look who's talking.
It's a discontinued item.

1076
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,930
Who's the one who was trying
to sell it for a premium...

1077
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,170
Wait a minute.

1078
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,510
You... Don't tell me...

1079
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,110
Are you selling Ji Sang's stuff?

1080
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:48,210
- This is Ji Sang's, isn't it?
- That's insane...

1081
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,420
Hey! Is that really what
you think of me?

1082
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,190
- Do you think you're even human?
- Hey, hold on!

1083
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,120
You're just
a money-grubbing monster!

1084
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:00,230
It's Refund Complete.

1085
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,460
"Refund complete?"

1086
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,030
(Refund complete)

1087
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:07,730
What?

1088
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:24,680
(To the Moon)

1089
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,440
(Special thanks to Yoon Kyung Ho
for his appearance)

1090
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,310
- Her ex-husband!
- Is he still texting you?

1091
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,340
What a nutcase.

1092
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,510
I'll never understand
married couples.

1093
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,640
We're not married!

1094
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,050
My boyfriend's coming
to Korea in a few days.

1095
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,550
What's this? Don't tell me
it's to meet the parents!

1096
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:58,120
But to be thinking
about marriage already...

1097
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,390
That's the plan.

1098
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:00,420
Her birthday?

1099
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,960
- It's my mom's 60th birthday soon.
- When's your dad's birthday?

1100
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,760
I'll never see that man again.

1101
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:05,930
The police station?

1102
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,560
My daughter!

1103
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,300
Don't tell me
you're into crypto too?

1104
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,000
I see you didn't tell your mother.

1105
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,630
Even if that man comes back,
I think I'd forgive him completely.

1106
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,300
Honey. Jung Im.

1107
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,300
It's me.

1108
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,470
Darn it.

1109
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:22,470
