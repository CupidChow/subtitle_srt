1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,440
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,740
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,910
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,480
What is it? What's wrong?

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,120
Look at this...

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,130
(Enderion minus 30.01 percent)

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,900
(Episode 10: Our Share)

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,610
Following the cyber hacking incident
at Equalus Cryptocurrency Exchange,

9
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,940
investor sentiment has
cooled dramatically.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,080
As major cryptocurrencies
continue their downward trend,

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,780
Enderion has also taken a downturn.

12
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,250
In just a few days, Enderion has
plummeted by nearly 30 percent.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,150
- It went up!
- What?

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,820
- It did?
- Really?

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,260
The cost of living went up again.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,930
Darn it.

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,760
Darn it, it dropped.
That girl, I swear.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,000
- It's up.
- Really?

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,600
How much?

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,870
My body fat is up from last year.

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,900
Why you...

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,570
It dropped again.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,210
It's up.

24
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,550
- How much?
- It went up?

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,050
Your daily fortune.

26
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,290
Hey. You're doing that on purpose,
aren't you?

27
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,860
Come on. Crypto is 70 percent luck
and 30 percent skill.

28
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,990
At this point,
we might as well check our fortunes.

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,290
What's your zodiac sign?

30
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,930
The Dragon.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,830
Let's see, Dragon...

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,600
Here it is.
"Misfortunes never come alone."

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,970
Sounds like a good one, right?

34
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,970
"Even if you fall backward,
you'll break your nose..."

35
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,870
Let's just eat.

36
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,210
Why you...

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Eun Sang.

38
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,380
- Shouldn't we just pull out?
- What?

39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,320
Come on.
It's already dropped by 30 percent.

40
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,820
She's right.

41
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,250
It has been
dropping for a few days now.

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Are you crazy?

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,590
We'd be fools if we pulled out now.

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,330
What if it drops even more?

45
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,960
Sometimes you just have to
ride out the storm.

46
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,330
If you worry about the day-to-day,
you'll never make the big bucks.

47
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,310
So let's just hold steady
and see this through, okay?

48
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,380
Let's talk about something else.

49
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,910
Anyone have some good news?

50
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,910
Right. Don't you have
anything interesting to share?

51
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,850
You got nothing?

52
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,090
So you're finally letting me
join the conversation?

53
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,960
Now that the mood
has gotten this awkward?

54
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,530
Fine, you're in.
Go ahead, say literally anything.

55
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,760
What is there to say...

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,670
Autumn will be here soon,
and the leaves will be falling.

57
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,800
Anything but things falling.
Talk about something else.

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,770
Da Hae,
your button is about to fall off.

59
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,380
I heard you were
quitting the company.

60
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,410
Is that true?

61
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,350
That's just a rumor.

62
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,380
Why would Dr. Ham quit a job
that's going so well?

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,250
He can make 500,000 dollars
in bonuses just for showing up.

64
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,820
You keep throwing around
"500,000 dollars..."

65
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,020
I didn't mean to offend you.

66
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,390
It's 600,000 dollars.

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
How annoying.

68
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,760
- What a turn-off.
- Stop saying "drop!"

69
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,100
Thank you for the meal.

70
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,470
Thank you.

71
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,570
Gosh, I'm stuffed.

72
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,110
We could've just split the bill.

73
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,440
Those who got all worked up,

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,450
demanding to know
who ate the pricey stir-fry...

75
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,210
when we were about
to split the bill,

76
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,950
shouldn't be complaining. Right?

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,090
Our finances were a little tight
for a fancy dish like that.

78
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,660
- Why? Is something wrong?
- It's just that...

79
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,590
The crypto market has been
tanking lately.

80
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,260
So everyone's been on edge.

81
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,630
- I thought it was serious.
- "Something serious?"

82
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,740
This might not be a big deal to you,
Dr. Ham.

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,240
- Want to get some ice cream?
- I'm getting chocolate.

84
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,280
Right.

85
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,250
Are you sure everything is
all right with you?

86
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,750
That whole thing
about you quitting...

87
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,520
Hoppang Bite was just talking
nonsense, right?

88
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,650
How many times must I tell you?

89
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,790
Workers talk about lunch
or quitting.

90
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,560
You shouldn't get worked up
over every little rumor.

91
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,500
Okay, fine then.

92
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,160
So...

93
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,900
about Jung Da Hee.

94
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,640
What's she like?

95
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,170
Da Hee?

96
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,010
Why?

97
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,910
What? No reason.

98
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,510
What? With Da Hee?

99
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,150
- Do what with her?
- The snack subscription box.

100
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,550
The launch deadline is tight,
so you'll need someone to help you.

101
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,120
So I want you and Da Hee
to work together on it.

102
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,490
What do you say?

103
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,630
Yes.
I'll do my best to help, Da Hee.

104
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,030
Oh...

105
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Okay.

106
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,580
Mr. Ko said you needed help,
so I volunteered.

107
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,110
You must be thrown off
by my arrival.

108
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,920
No, not at all.

109
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,150
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

110
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Okay.

111
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,890
Oh, about that letter...

112
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
The letter?

113
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,490
I mentioned it only to you...

114
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,060
that I'd put a letter
in your locker.

115
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,670
About that...

116
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,300
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,110
- What for?
- The thing is, about that letter...

118
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,170
I'm the one who took it.

119
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,180
You did?

120
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Yes.

121
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,220
But can we leave it
at that for today?

122
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,350
I have my reasons,
which I can't explain just yet.

123
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,820
This must be a big shock for you.

124
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,920
No. I wasn't trying
to interrogate you or anything.

125
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,030
But to be honest,
I was a little surprised too.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
I took the envelope,

128
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,530
but it was just an empty envelope.

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,140
The letter itself was gone.

130
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,710
I threw it away.

131
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,410
- You what?
- It was an accident.

132
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,250
I feel so terrible, I'm so sorry.

133
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,020
Don't worry about it.

134
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,790
But still...

135
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,820
Are you busy, Da Hee?

136
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,360
Let me buy you a meal,

137
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,960
or at least a coffee.

138
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,660
I feel too guilty
leaving it like this.

139
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,830
And I'm worried you might get
the wrong idea about me.

140
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,170
No, not at all.
There's nothing to misunderstand.

141
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,140
I actually have plans today.

142
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,040
Let's get coffee another time.

143
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,390
(Notice on Interim
Severance Pay Application)

144
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,400
Looks like applications are open
for severance pay.

145
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,470
Yes.

146
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,040
On the 73rd National Liberation Day,
President Moon Jae In...

147
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,750
stated true liberation means peace
on the Korean Peninsula.

148
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,620
You're struggling as is
and have another mouth to feed.

149
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,450
Why would you make
side dishes for me?

150
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Your dad just eats the leftovers.
Don't worry about it.

151
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,460
Hey, I'm fine with leftovers.

152
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,600
How's your back?

153
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,200
Gosh, my back's a little sore
from lying down all the time.

154
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,630
I was asking Mom.

155
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,340
Oh, I shouldn't have spoken.

156
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,710
It's the same as usual.

157
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,010
It actually feels better
when I move around,

158
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,610
and it's a lot easier to walk.

159
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,350
But you can't exactly move around
when you're driving all day.

160
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,220
She won't be doing that much longer.

161
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,420
- Her boss wants her to retire...
- Will you be quiet?

162
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,490
What's going on?

163
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Mom, are you retiring?

164
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,860
No.

165
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,100
- Just eat your apple.
- Seriously, are you retiring?

166
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,160
No,

167
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,600
they reduced the number
of bus routes,

168
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,070
so management asked...

169
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,000
if I'd be willing
to take some time off.

170
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,740
They were just testing the waters.

171
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,580
- What? Isn't that the same thing?
- I said no, it's not like that.

172
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,710
Besides,

173
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,510
if I retire, I have no intention
of depending on you.

174
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,820
Who's worried about that?

175
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,090
Then stop making that face
and eat your apple. Okay?

176
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,190
- You have some too, Mom.
- Of course I will.

177
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,860
Why are you eating the bruised spot?

178
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,730
It's fine. I'll cut the bruise out.

179
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Darn it.

180
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,800
You should be
cutting something else out.

181
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,340
Gosh, I don't get why
people even eat apples.

182
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,420
(Enderion)

183
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,730
Darn it,
should I really just sell now?

184
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,260
I should salvage what I can
for Mom's living expenses.

185
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,030
But everyone said I'd be a fool
to sell now.

186
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,270
Maybe if I put in a little more
at this price...

187
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
What?

188
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,110
Only a ship that weathers the storm
can reach the farthest seas.

189
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,620
Unwavering faith brings
a great reward.

190
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,450
- Da Hae, that's your horoscope
- What is this?

191
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,450
for the month.

192
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,490
Of all the times,
she has to send this.

193
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,760
Fine.

194
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,630
Why should my mom eat bruised fruit?

195
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,270
Okay.

196
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,340
All right. Let's do this.

197
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,140
I'll cash out my severance pay
and put it into crypto.

198
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,280
(I'll cash out my severance pay
and put it into crypto.)

199
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,580
Hi.

200
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,420
I was told my severance pay
came through.

201
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,960
I'm Jung Da Hae
from the Marketing Team.

202
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
Yes.

203
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,100
First, could you please sign
the confirmation form?

204
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,670
Sure.

205
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,800
(Severance Pay
Acknowledgment of Receipt)

206
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,400
By the way, are you and Eun Sang
doing something together?

207
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,410
Eun Sang? Why do you ask?

208
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,040
Ms. Eun Sang just collected...

209
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,340
her severance pay
a little while ago.

210
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,150
And now you're applying
for yours too,

211
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,480
so I just figured you two
were doing something together.

212
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,120
Eun Sang applied for
her severance pay too?

213
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,820
You didn't know?
I assumed you knew, being so close.

214
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
You're all set.

215
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,230
Enderion is reeling from
a string of bad news,

216
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,100
plummeting more than fifty percent
from its peak.

217
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,070
Financial experts warn that
if the current downtrend continues,

218
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,110
it could trigger a market crash,
raising serious concerns.

219
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,110
Wasn't this crypto on a bull run
just a little while ago?

220
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,280
- What's going on?
- Crypto, sir.

221
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,850
- Nevertheless, Enderion...
- This stuff!

222
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,520
I heard someone
supposedly made a million off this.

223
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,650
Gosh, and now look at it.
It's tanked.

224
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,460
A million dollars is a huge amount,
isn't it?

225
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,990
I wish people
who made that much money...

226
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,730
had to wear a name tag or something.

227
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,260
- Why's that?
- So I can mooch a coffee off them.

228
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,000
Would you like some coffee?

229
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,800
- What?
- Why are you offering?

230
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,940
- I also hit ten...
- You made a million dollars?

231
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,640
punches.

232
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,480
I got ten punches on my coffee card.

233
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,780
- Excuse me, Eun Sang?
- Oh! You startled me.

234
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,980
Yes.

235
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,050
I'm sorry.
I just came to buy a bandage.

236
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,620
Sure. Just a moment.

237
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,690
(Enderion)

238
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,300
It keeps dropping...

239
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,930
It's dropping like a rock...

240
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,510
This feels like
a major unlucky streak.

241
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,950
Tell me, oh wise one,
what does my future hold?

242
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,380
(Father)

243
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,790
Oh my gosh.

244
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,560
Ma'am, what is it with you now?

245
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,900
If you're going to be this dramatic,
just go get a boyfriend.

246
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,430
It's the crypto.

247
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,230
I haven't slept a wink.

248
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,970
I sold off my bags, my shoes,
and all my precious babies...

249
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,000
to buy crypto.

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,640
But the price just keeps tanking.

251
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,270
Gosh, well,

252
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,940
getting rid of your precious babies
was a good call, but...

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,410
Just live your realistic life.

254
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,680
Losing sleep and skipping meals...

255
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,980
isn't going to make
your crypto go up.

256
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,720
At this point,
should I find another income source?

257
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,030
Doing what?

258
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,800
Portable hand sanitizer?

259
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,500
Masks?

260
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,940
Listen, I have a gut feeling
about this.

261
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,570
I feel a huge plague is going to
sweep the nation someday...

262
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,110
There you go again
with the crazy talk.

263
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,410
- A plague? Give me a break.
- I'm serious!

264
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,620
If a specific product doesn't meet
consumer expectations,

265
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,850
it's only a matter of time
before they drop their subscription.

266
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,760
It's hard to predict how many people
will even subscribe.

267
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,960
- As a new business venture,
- Did Eun Sang use her money...

268
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,760
- the risks seem too high.
- to buy low?

269
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,230
- What was that?
- Sorry?

270
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
What did you say?

271
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,270
It was nothing.

272
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,600
Okay, so? Go on.

273
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,370
We'd be stuck
if we set everything up...

274
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,840
and then get too few subscribers.

275
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,310
Manipulating the budget
and stock is a burden, too.

276
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,980
- But...
- Realistically,

277
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,250
there's no compelling reason
for a subscription service...

278
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,180
of snacks you can buy
at any convenience store.

279
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,090
That's why I think
we need to rethink this...

280
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,290
and take a step back
to reconsider it objectively.

281
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,390
Yes, I agree.

282
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,760
- I was thinking the same thing.
- All right, in that case,

283
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,400
let's all think this over
from every angle.

284
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,200
Da Hae, address Da Hee's points
in a supplementary report.

285
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,670
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, meeting adjourned. Let's go.

286
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
- Thank you, sir.
- Good work.

287
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,610
Okay, everyone else can head out.
Da Hae, can I have a word with you?

288
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,340
- Okay.
- Good work, everyone.

289
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,080
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,650
Why the long face?

291
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,520
I wonder if dropping this business
is really the best for everyone.

292
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,500
Listen, a company
isn't a place for Kumbaya moments.

293
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,800
If we want what's best for everyone,

294
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,260
we should all join the Peace Corps.

295
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,330
Right?

296
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,870
- Why not discuss it with friends?
- What?

297
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,670
When you're chatting with friends,
sometimes ideas just start flowing.

298
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,740
That group you always hang out with.
That crew of off-cycle hires...

299
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,950
I mean, your besties.

300
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,550
Talk it over with them.

301
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,990
Conversation is the solution
to all our problems.

302
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,050
Okay?

303
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,760
Take your time.

304
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
A conversation...

305
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
You're working late?

306
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,340
Yes. I have to work late.
Help me brainstorm a bit,

307
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,640
and we can keep an eye
on our crypto.

308
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,440
We can watch the charts live
and make some moves together.

309
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,880
Ta-da!

310
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,080
I even brought snacks!

311
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,810
I've got tteokbokki,
fish cake soup, and sundae.

312
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Looks delicious, right?

313
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,320
Should we book a conference room?

314
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,590
We could use the big screen...

315
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,490
- No way.
- What?

316
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,020
- What?
- Is crypto a soccer match?

317
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,830
Why would you all gather around
just to watch it?

318
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,600
Why not? This is as big
as the Korea-Japan match to us.

319
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,570
I'm just tired.

320
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,240
I'm heading out. Enjoy.

321
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,910
(Marron Confectionery)

322
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,380
She could've stayed for a bit.

323
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,150
I can't believe she's just left
like that.

324
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,760
She seems really exhausted lately.

325
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,690
She must have a lot on her plate.
She's been leaving work later, too.

326
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,530
Why?

327
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,200
Is the Sales Team that busy
these days?

328
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,560
It seems that way.

329
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,700
She doesn't discuss work in detail.

330
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,730
True.

331
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,500
- Okay, I'll set the 1-minute chart.
- Okay.

332
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,840
Alright, let's pray.

333
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,840
Okay, fine.

334
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,210
Okay. Dear deities.

335
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,180
If the crypto goes up,
I swear I'll be a better person.

336
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,690
I'll take every flyer
from the old ladies on the street.

337
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,220
And trash...

338
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,920
I'll be more thorough
with recycling...

339
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,860
and do my part for the environment.

340
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,560
Please, I beg you,
just five percent.

341
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,630
Just five percent!

342
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,270
It dropped.

343
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,170
Darn it.

344
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,240
Dear deities!

345
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,010
If this crypto goes up,
I'll be good.

346
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,140
I'll even stop losing my temper.

347
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,780
Also, I'll stop drinking...

348
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,350
You're going to stop?

349
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,090
I'll stick to domestic beer.

350
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,460
Please, just five percent!

351
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,090
- Just five percent!
- Just five percent!

352
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,960
It dropped.

353
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,230
Darn it.

354
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,740
Dear deities!

355
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,740
- Dear deities!
- Dear deities!

356
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,310
- Dear deities!
- Dear deities!

357
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,980
- Please, just five percent!
- Just five percent, please!

358
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,960
Did it go up?

359
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
No.

360
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,830
No!

361
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,000
(Please go up one percent.)

362
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,070
What's this?

363
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,810
Did you see the crypto
dropped again...

364
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,040
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,310
I was calling to see if anyone
was interested in renting my place.

366
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,020
I see. Please handle it
as soon as possible.

367
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,450
It's pretty urgent.

368
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,220
- Okay.
- What was that?

369
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,290
Her apartment...

370
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,030
She's putting it on the market?

371
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,090
This is huge.

372
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,960
Did you see Hoppang Bite's post?

373
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,770
A coworker made a million dollars.

374
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,370
They hit it big with crypto.

375
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,270
It was called Enderion, I think?

376
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,870
But didn't that crash recently?

377
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,810
They must've cashed out at the peak.

378
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,410
You know it's all about timing.

379
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,780
I'm so jealous.

380
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Who could it be?
You read the post and have no idea?

381
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,750
It didn't say who.

382
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,020
"She made all that money
off crypto,"

383
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,350
"but she won't
even discount a pair of stockings."

384
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,160
"Not only is she greedy,
she's stingy."

385
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,330
Does that ring a bell?

386
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,600
Come on, who else around here
sells stockings?

387
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,130
Don't tell me,
the Kang Eun Sang Store?

388
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,500
- Kang Eun Sang?
- Kang Eun Sang?

389
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,700
She's so lucky.

390
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,140
I bet she'll quit now.

391
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,640
She's set for life now.

392
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,040
Darn it, I should've bought
some crypto.

393
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,540
I'm so jealous.

394
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,150
- A million dollars?
- Gosh, but how did she do it?

395
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,710
They said she did it with crypto.

396
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,180
Isn't she close with Kim Ji Song?

397
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,490
They were.

398
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,260
- I'll be back for the rest later.
- Okay.

399
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,440
Someone here made
a million in crypto.

400
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,740
To my recollection,
Ms. Kang wasn't the only one.

401
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,640
That trio from off-cycle hires.
She probably invested with them.

402
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,340
So they all made
a few hundred grand each?

403
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,510
Nope. Just Ms. Kang.

404
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,710
So she wanted it all for herself.

405
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,710
And didn't tell them till the end?

406
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,780
But they seemed so close.

407
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,250
They probably stuck together
for work as off-cycle hires.

408
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,520
In the end, they're just coworkers.

409
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,220
Who do they think they are?

410
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,330
Da Hae, here are the documents
you asked for.

411
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,260
Right. Thanks.

412
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,030
By the way, Da Hae,

413
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,370
it's about Ms. Eun Sang.

414
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,370
Did she really make a million bucks
and buy a house?

415
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,410
That's really incredible.

416
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,810
What?

417
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,940
As if making a million
wasn't enough,

418
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,810
now they're saying
she bought a house too?

419
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,550
Oh my.

420
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,180
Since you two are close,

421
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,350
I just figured you'd already heard
about it.

422
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,790
Yes, well...

423
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
What?

424
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,360
Wait, this part about
her buying a house...

425
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,360
Didn't you find out from
Hoppang Bite's post?

426
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,460
There was nothing about that
in there.

427
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,970
So how did you hear about it,
Da Hae?

428
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,070
I just heard it somewhere.

429
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,370
It's all over the office already.

430
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,970
- A million dollars?
- She made a million dollars?

431
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,180
- What?
- A million...

432
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,250
- I should've gotten into crypto.
- Right.

433
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,280
But...

434
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,050
Weren't you into crypto too, Da Hae?

435
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,550
I wonder if only Ms. Eun Sang
made money.

436
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
I wonder why.

437
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,900
If I had a million dollars,
I'd quit on the spot.

438
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,060
Me too.

439
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,760
Honestly, that's better
than the lottery.

440
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,940
So, we need a sales strategy
that reflects the current trends.

441
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,570
We could do
a convenience store exclusive...

442
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,310
- Are you listening to me?
- Gosh, a million dollars.

443
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Sorry?

444
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,050
Sir...

445
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,280
Sorry,
my mind wandered for a second.

446
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,190
Are you sleepy?
Should I grab you a cup of coffee?

447
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,820
- I'll have a macchiato.
- I'll take a cheesecake.

448
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,730
No, I just meant
from the break room...

449
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,890
I'm buying again?

450
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,630
Well, the one who can afford it
should pay.

451
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Excuse me?

452
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,500
(Marron Confectionery)

453
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,110
Hey, we're running really late.

454
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,210
Da Hae, the last bus is
in five minutes! Run!

455
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,910
Five minutes? Darn it.

456
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
Hey, guys.

457
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,510
Let's just get a cab.

458
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,050
What?

459
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,150
- What?
- Eun Sang,

460
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,150
why are you hailing a cab?

461
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,790
We can still catch the last bus
if we run.

462
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,390
You'll spend more on hospital bills
if you mess up your knees. Get in!

463
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,460
What?

464
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,730
What's with her?
She always said cab fare is a waste.

465
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,700
Excuse me, sir.

466
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,570
Could you let me out
up ahead, please?

467
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,940
You're not going home, Eun Sang?

468
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,940
Yes, I have to make a quick stop.

469
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,810
- Where to?
- I'm just meeting a friend.

470
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,250
You have other friends besides us?

471
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,780
What are you, a detective?
What's with all the questions?

472
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,250
Eun Sang, we'll get it.

473
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,820
Don't be silly. I'll get it.

474
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,230
You will?

475
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,660
Why not?

476
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,500
No, it's just...

477
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,830
What? Is there something
you want to say to me?

478
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,940
Aren't you the one
who has something...

479
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
to tell us?

480
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Sir.

481
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,610
Give the change to the girls
in the back.

482
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,380
- Okay.
- Don't you two go wandering off.

483
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,420
Go straight home, okay?

484
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
Okay.

485
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,990
For real?

486
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,200
I heard her on the phone
with a realtor this morning.

487
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,830
She's really putting her house
on the market?

488
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
But why?

489
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,400
Is it because
she bought a new place?

490
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,740
I don't know. Rumor is
that Eun Sang is going to quit.

491
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
But why won't she tell us anything?

492
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Shoot.

493
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,980
Maybe she has her reasons.

494
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,050
Maybe the timing just wasn't right.

495
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,650
And she just didn't get to tell us.

496
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

497
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,960
Right! We've been so busy lately,
we really haven't had time to talk.

498
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,560
That's true.
We've been working late.

499
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,460
- Yes, you're right.
- Yes.

500
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,900
Darn it,
this company is the problem.

501
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,330
We deserve a work-life balance.

502
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,600
Then we'd actually have time
to talk like this.

503
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,200
You're right. We're so tight.

504
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,740
Does she really think
we'd be jealous...

505
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,040
just because she made some money?

506
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,140
- They don't know us at all.
- Exactly.

507
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,310
- Seriously.
- Oh! I have an idea.

508
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,710
What is it?

509
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,550
I was on the fence about canceling,
but what the heck, let's just go.

510
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,890
Go where?

511
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,020
You know. The place we booked
when crypto was up.

512
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,830
I didn't expect the market
to suddenly crash, but...

513
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,300
Anyway, since we already booked it,
let's just go.

514
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,430
Oh, you mean...

515
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,600
Where?

516
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,540
Ju Man,
where did you say we're going?

517
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,440
A rock festival in the UK!

518
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,870
Yes, right. How are we supposed
to go to that?

519
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,510
I sent out a ton of promo emails...

520
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,850
with your new song, profile,
and albums.

521
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,450
The response was pretty good,
so I was getting my hopes up.

522
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
And get this.

523
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,650
We got a bite from overseas.

524
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,790
They want you
at their fall festival.

525
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,060
They'll cover your flight and hotel.

526
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
All you have to do is show up.
So, naturally...

527
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,330
We're going!
We absolutely have to go.

528
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,730
It might not be the main stage,
but it's a big deal.

529
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,570
It'll be streamed
on official channels.

530
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,440
So they actually heard my music
and reached out to book me?

531
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,140
That's what I'm telling you,
you punk!

532
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,680
- Don't get too worked up.
- Oh my gosh.

533
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,210
We need to polish the band version
a little before then.

534
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,750
Man, I've gotta hand it to you.
I kept telling you not to do it,

535
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,620
but you were so stubborn,
and in the end,

536
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,950
you're making it
to the UK after all.

537
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,960
I'm proud of you, my friend!

538
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,020
Ham Ji Woo, you son of a gun!

539
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,560
We finally made it! We made it.

540
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,530
- But when is it again?
- What?

541
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,970
This historic day of my UK debut.
When is it?

542
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,200
That historic day? The date?

543
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,870
Wait a minute. Your company...

544
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,310
You still have vacation days, right?
You can make it work?

545
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,210
Of course!

546
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,120
I'm a director, for crying out loud.
You think I can't clear my schedule?

547
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,520
Don't you worry about it.

548
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,120
There's no way
I'm missing this chance.

549
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,790
- I'm going no matter what.
- Gosh, you scared me.

550
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,190
- I'm going no matter what.
- Okay.

551
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,620
- It's a sure thing.
- Okay.

552
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,860
I absolutely have to go.

553
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,430
I have to, but...

554
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,830
Oh, what am I going to do?

555
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,440
Thank you.

556
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,720
You can tell it's pricey.
It's so meaty.

557
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,360
- Yes.
- Right?

558
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,120
It sure beats imitation crab meat.

559
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,230
Hey, come on.

560
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,190
How can you even compare lobster
to imitation crab?

561
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,830
Should we each get another one?
It's on me.

562
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,630
What?

563
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,110
Crypto tanked again last night.

564
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,540
Where are you
getting all this money?

565
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,710
Eun Sang,

566
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,480
is there something
you need to tell us?

567
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,950
What?

568
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,190
Yes. Something you were
too busy to share?

569
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
Right.

570
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
I...

571
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,300
have something to tell you guys.

572
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,330
What is it?

573
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,660
I'm all ears.

574
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,830
I...

575
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,140
think I have hemorrhoids.
It's killing me every night.

576
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,980
I'm kidding.

577
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,180
Guys, I don't have anything
to tell you.

578
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,620
But I do have...

579
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,150
I guess it's true that
the person involved in the rumor...

580
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,150
is always the last to know.

581
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,790
A rumor? What rumor?

582
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,230
This is so frustrating.

583
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,030
It's about you.

584
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,570
The rumor is that you made a killing
with crypto,

585
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,300
that you cashed out, bought a house,
and now you're planning to quit.

586
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,610
And you did it all without saying
a single word to us...

587
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,680
Eun Sang, it's the talk
of the entire office.

588
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,880
What? Where did a ridiculous rumor
like that come from?

589
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,080
Guys, who would even believe that?

590
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,060
Seriously, who would believe that?

591
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,670
Wait, you must actually
believe this.

592
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,470
It's not that we believe it.

593
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,450
Eun Sang!

594
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Wait.

595
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Eun Sang!

596
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,490
Where are you going?
We're not done talking.

597
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,400
- What else is there to say?
- Did you really sell your crypto?

598
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,370
All by yourself? Without telling us?

599
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,500
Da Hae, you can't just ask her
like that...

600
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,410
Do I really need to answer that?

601
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,180
Yes! Just say something. Anything.

602
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,480
You don't exactly look like
you're in the mood to listen.

603
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,790
You look like you want to punch me.

604
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,430
You're really not going
to say anything?

605
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,330
Fine. Then we're done.

606
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,940
- What?
- We just met through work, right?

607
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,910
This happens when we overstep
and get too involved personally.

608
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,210
We're just coworkers,
nothing more than that. Right?

609
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,980
Hey, come on, Da Hae.

610
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,280
I'll be more careful from now on.

611
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,580
I won't cross the line again,
Ms. Kang Eun Sang.

612
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
What? "Ms.?"

613
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,350
Ms. Kang Eun Sang? How dare you!

614
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,930
- Eun Sang...
- What?

615
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,160
Did you just grab my hair?

616
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,900
I grabbed your bag.

617
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,000
Fine, I did.
What are you going to do about it?

618
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,470
Eun Sang, let go of her.
Let go and talk.

619
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,900
Excuse me. You think
you're the only one with a hand?

620
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,350
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to grab mine?

621
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,980
Gosh, Jung Da Hae.

622
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,420
You were raised right, weren't you?

623
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,020
You're such a proper young lady.

624
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,160
Darn it, just let me go!

625
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,290
- Eun Sang!
- Hey!

626
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,630
Do you have to say things
in such a hurtful way?

627
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,630
At least
I'm saying something hurtful!

628
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,530
But you're not saying
anything at all.

629
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,330
Darn it, you're unbelievable...

630
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,700
- You little...
- Darn it, just let me go!

631
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,670
- Let go of her.
- I said, let go!

632
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Let go.

633
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,670
That hurts.

634
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,040
Da Hae, are you okay?

635
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
Are you okay?

636
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,510
Eun Sang, what's wrong with you?

637
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,780
Think whatever you want.

638
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,490
Believe whatever
you want to believe.

639
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,620
Do whatever you want!

640
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,260
- Darn it.
- Eun Sang! Wait!

641
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,400
Yes, sorry about that.

642
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,030
Kang Eun Sang.

643
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,030
Kang Eun Sang!

644
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,070
What do you mean,
"think whatever I want?"

645
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,040
Tell me before you go.

646
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,970
Where are you going?

647
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,980
Da Hae!

648
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Da Hae!

649
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,960
Come on. Are you crazy?

650
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,190
So you bought a car?

651
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,990
- What?
- Da Hae...

652
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,430
You really did sell your crypto
to buy a house and even a car.

653
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,870
I bet you'll quit your job too.

654
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,900
Get out of the way.

655
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,840
Then just say so.

656
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,710
You think you can just leave
without a word? Is that it?

657
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,080
Seriously?
Are we just coworkers to you?

658
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,480
Is that why you're acting like this?

659
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,750
When did I say that?

660
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,450
You're the one who's saying it.

661
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,450
You're supposed to say,
"No, we're not!"

662
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,460
That we're not just coworkers.

663
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,460
That we're real friends.

664
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,930
That we're family.

665
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,700
If you cashed out your crypto,
why didn't you just tell us?

666
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,430
Were you afraid we'd curse you out?

667
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,840
Fine, I cashed out.

668
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,450
- To pay you guys back.
- What?

669
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,820
What's this?

670
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,620
The crypto...

671
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,900
It kept dropping.

672
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,370
You were about to lose all
of your initial investments,

673
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,200
so I got an advance on my severance
to cover your losses,

674
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,510
but even that wasn't quite enough.

675
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,170
What are you talking about?

676
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,080
Then putting your house up
for sale...

677
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,810
Wait, and this car is...

678
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,520
I'm a designated driver!

679
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,990
I needed cash fast.
What choice did I have?

680
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,690
I had to take on a driving gig.

681
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,020
Today,

682
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,460
I asked you to meet up
so I could give you this money,

683
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,960
but things just kept
getting messed up.

684
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,300
But still, why the crypto?

685
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,500
You said it'd go back up
if we waited.

686
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,270
I said that so you wouldn't worry.

687
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,870
If by some chance things went south,

688
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,240
I was planning to pay you back
for everything.

689
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,180
It was my idea to get into crypto
in the first place.

690
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,650
To be honest,

691
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,520
ever since I suggested
we invest in crypto,

692
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,660
I haven't had a single moment
of peace.

693
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,190
I know this was
our only option left,

694
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,430
but still...

695
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,200
I...

696
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,710
I was afraid that I had...

697
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,180
just made your lives even harder.

698
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,350
I was scared too.

699
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,550
I don't understand...

700
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,690
Then why didn't you just tell us?

701
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,860
How could I tell you
something like that?

702
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,860
That to pay you back,
I used severance, worked a side job?

703
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,530
You would've felt so burdened.

704
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,370
I did it so you wouldn't worry,

705
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,600
but if I just told you everything...

706
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,670
I guess you're right.

707
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,970
I really wish I hadn't heard that.

708
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,410
If you had made a profit,
it was yours to keep.

709
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,110
Why would you give that up
because of us?

710
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,490
Why, for our sake,

711
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,760
would you give up
on your own happiness?

712
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,960
Kang Eun Sang!

713
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,830
You're supposed to make
a ton of money!

714
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,300
Buy a house, buy a car,

715
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,170
quit your job,

716
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,470
and go on amazing vacations!

717
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,040
You have to live your life...

718
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,010
and be happy.

719
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,680
As happy as you can possibly be!

720
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,680
That's all we ever wanted for you.

721
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,990
Who asked you for money?

722
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,490
She's right!

723
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,530
You should look out for yourself.

724
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,630
Why are you being so foolish?

725
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,460
Gosh, you guys...

726
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,970
What are you two idiots
talking about?

727
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,170
You two are my reward.

728
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,410
I've already gotten my share.

729
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,740
I've received more than enough,
you fools

730
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,550
I'm...

731
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,750
going to be with you guys...

732
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,320
until the very end.

733
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,190
I swear, she drives me nuts.

734
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,260
Honestly!

735
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,700
Why didn't you tell us?

736
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Excuse me.

737
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
Aren't you going to drive?

738
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,710
- No, she's not!
- No, I'm not.

739
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,620
A bond that needs no words.

740
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,650
Isn't that what friendship is about?

741
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,520
Am I the only one cringing?

742
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,290
Did you really have to post this?

743
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,660
I wanted to tell the whole world
about our friendship.

744
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,230
Guess I was feeling sentimental
last night.

745
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,900
I just want to drown in my tears.

746
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,470
I'm pretty sure we had
a touching moment yesterday.

747
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,210
Tell me about it. Now it feels
like we're at a funeral.

748
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,880
Why won't it go up? Why?

749
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,050
(Enderion)

750
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,550
- Why can't I?
- What made you think you could?

751
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,650
But I'm an executive director.

752
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,090
You make more than the others,
so you're expected to work harder.

753
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,190
That's just how it is.

754
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,490
But I'm still an executive director.

755
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,930
Also, you used way too many
of your vacation days this spring.

756
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,930
If I do a good job, shouldn't I get
double the vacation days?

757
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,340
Don't we have a benefit like that?

758
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,570
Since you are good at your job,

759
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,540
your schedule has doubled.

760
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,150
Also, on the days you requested off,
there's an important CEO meeting.

761
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,910
What if I go straight to the airport
after the meeting...

762
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,050
In the evening,

763
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,920
there is an even more
important meeting...

764
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,090
the chairman will attend.

765
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,120
Then what about me?

766
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,090
When the do I get to handle
my important work?

767
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,230
About that...

768
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,860
About that?

769
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,770
Hang in there, sir.

770
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Good luck!

771
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,680
Gosh, he just said, "Hang in there."

772
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,350
I...

773
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,080
- I needed to talk to you.
- It was just a stupid pipe dream.

774
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,350
What?

775
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,990
- What was?
- The crypto.

776
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,460
I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.
I should have known better.

777
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,200
Still,
you need a dream to live for, right?

778
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,430
Dreams don't put food on the table.

779
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,470
You just have to...

780
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,240
hold on to what you've got,
and that's all that matters.

781
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,880
Getting greedy will
only lead to ruin.

782
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,180
It's nothing more than
a fleeting dream.

783
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,650
Right.

784
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,790
You wanted my advice?

785
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,450
Is everything okay?

786
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,960
Oh, that...

787
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,920
It's nothing.

788
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,330
Am I really cursed or something?
Nothing is going my way.

789
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,030
I need to know what my future holds.
I'm scared I can't see what's ahead.

790
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,240
So, what should I do with my life?

791
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,610
(Dad)

792
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,180
Come on, just say something,
anything, Dad.

793
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,350
Ji Song, could you
process these expenses?

794
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,460
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

795
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,960
- What's this?
- First-half donation records.

796
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,200
It includes donations to churches
and temples, too.

797
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,500
You sponsor snacks for
the little monks, too?

798
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,870
Yes, I went along
to help with the delivery last time.

799
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,910
It was really nice.

800
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,240
Isn't it better to receive
than give?

801
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,640
I was going through
a hard time then,

802
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,940
but just getting away for a bit...

803
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,610
really lifted my spirits.
It helped clear my head.

804
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,950
And one of the monks there...

805
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,750
even wrote me a good luck charm.

806
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,320
A good luck charm?

807
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,660
Do you have a wish
you're hoping for?

808
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,360
Doesn't everyone?

809
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Well...

810
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,030
Here, have one of these
before you get back to it.

811
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,670
Okay, I'm counting on you.

812
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,770
What's with him?
When did he get so smooth?

813
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,220
Dear deity!

814
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,790
Are you really going
to do this to me?

815
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,790
Dear deity! Clock in for your shift!

816
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,230
Get to work on our crypto!

817
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,400
Let's just go.

818
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,070
Go where?

819
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,270
To see a deity.

820
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,510
Isn't that a little extreme?

821
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,410
No, I meant let's go see my dad.

822
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,310
He's a monk.

823
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,450
Doesn't he have,
like, a direct line to dieties?

824
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,820
But why would we go to your dad?

825
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,520
- I see.
- It's not like starving...

826
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,620
and staring at the charts
will make a difference.

827
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,360
All we're doing is watching it drop.
It's just making me sick.

828
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,760
We'd be better off getting away
from crypto for a while.

829
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,330
Otherwise, we might get wiped out.

830
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,620
Let's go.

831
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,650
Eun Sang.

832
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,530
Eun Sang.

833
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,030
My dad.

834
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,310
Thank you all for
making the journey out here.

835
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,310
This is a place to unburden yourself
and seek enlightenment.

836
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,450
You've come here to briefly escape
the noise and turmoil of the world,

837
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,850
which must be why you've come.

838
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,880
Yes.

839
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,090
So, from this moment,
to help you hear your inner voice,

840
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,060
we will now collect your phones.

841
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,230
What?

842
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,430
What gives?

843
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,770
Thank you.

844
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,470
Excuse me.

845
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,610
Do we really have to
hand over our phones?

846
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,180
Let me just check it one last time.

847
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
Come on, you two.

848
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,650
Isn't this the whole reason
we came here?

849
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,520
Let's just tough it out.

850
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,430
Fine.

851
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,870
Right.

852
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,510
A digital detox.

853
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,610
And a crypto detox. Let's do this.

854
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,920
What's wrong?
Feeling a little shaky?

855
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,120
No, it's not that...

856
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,690
Is that crypto withdrawal?

857
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,260
- For real?
- No, it's not!

858
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,090
You're shaking a lot.

859
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,190
- Don't.
- Want me to hold you steady?

860
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,730
No. Really, I'm fine.

861
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,010
It's because your minds still linger
in the secular world...

862
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,080
that things like this
are bound to happen.

863
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,820
You must empty your minds.

864
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,650
You must cast aside all attachments
without regret.

865
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,590
Only then can you
truly feel unburdened.

866
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,590
I bet my medical bills
will burden me more.

867
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,060
Gosh, my knees...

868
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,720
It's amazing, really.

869
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,460
We only unplugged from the world
for half a day,

870
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,760
but I already feel so much lighter.

871
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,100
Maybe it's because we've emptied
ourselves of all our desires?

872
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,400
What desires did you let go of?

873
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,910
The desire for a nice, cold beer.

874
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,570
I got rid of it.

875
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,380
My desire for a long, healthy life
without taking care of myself.

876
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,750
I got rid of that.

877
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,350
That urge to watch
"just one more vid" on YouTube.

878
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:28,550
It's gone.

879
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,920
The desire for our crypto...

880
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,420
to go up.

881
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,700
I got rid of all of that, too.
How about you?

882
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,300
Me too.

883
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,270
I got rid of it all.

884
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,070
It feels like my desire for crypto
got a full-on enema.

885
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,210
It's completely clean.

886
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,270
- All flushed away.
- I couldn't get rid of it.

887
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,380
What?

888
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,750
What is that? Where'd you get it?

889
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,420
I pretended to turn it in earlier.

890
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,700
You little devil.

891
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,800
- You'll burn in torment.
- Crypto!

892
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,070
Aren't you curious at all?

893
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,270
- It could've gone up by now.
- Did it?

894
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,470
I don't know.

895
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,780
I have no signal,
so I can't get online.

896
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,680
Where do we have to go?
Where can we get a signal?

897
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,220
Hey.

898
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,390
Hold on.

899
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Hey.

900
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,510
- Why won't this thing connect?
- Hey, try over there.

901
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,740
Just a sec.

902
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,780
- For crying out loud.
- What's wrong?

903
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,680
After coming all this way
for a temple stay,

904
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,710
we said we'd let go
of all our greed,

905
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,120
but look at us now.

906
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,550
I'm starting to have
a serious reality check.

907
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,150
Hey. A reality check is one thing.

908
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,850
But the bear market hit us hard.

909
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,260
Please.

910
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,290
How can you really let go of greed?

911
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,990
Even if you get an enema,
it just keeps building up.

912
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,300
You never stop pooping, right?

913
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,760
How can anyone live without pooping?

914
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,270
- Hey, Ji Song, give it here.
- Good idea.

915
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,570
Let me see it.

916
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,600
- The signal's really weak.
- Hold on.

917
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,700
Watch out!

918
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,110
Ouch, that hurts.

919
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,650
- Da Hae, are you okay?
- Da Hae!

920
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,080
- Da Hae.
- Hey, are you okay?

921
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,150
Yes, I'm okay.

922
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,350
Da Hae.

923
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,190
It hurts.

924
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,730
You're saying...

925
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,740
this is all because of crypto?

926
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,840
Is money really that important
to you?

927
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,810
Who in the world doesn't like money?

928
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,110
What would you spend it on?

929
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,450
There's no shortage of things.

930
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,320
What do you hope to be with money?

931
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,690
Well...

932
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:18,860
My friends.

933
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,960
Do you know the one Korean word
that Koreans can never get right?

934
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,660
It's "Pull."

935
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,060
Even when the sign says "Pull,"
most of us just push anyway.

936
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,370
And yet, the door still opens.

937
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,870
But there are some doors in life
that will only open if you pull.

938
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,770
Money is one of those doors.

939
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,680
Some people say you can
take it or leave it,

940
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,910
but there are moments
when you absolutely must have it.

941
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,750
But what's more important
is what you do after you open it.

942
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,720
Once you open it and walk through,
what will you do?

943
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,030
Where will you go?

944
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,270
Be the master of your own desires.

945
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:06,770
Then you'll know what you truly want
and where you ought to go.

946
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,610
You'll be able to decide
for yourselves.

947
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,210
May I...

948
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,410
ask you a question?

949
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,020
Please do.

950
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,750
Are you really...

951
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,850
Ji Song's dad?

952
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,390
For someone who's basically a monk
to be her father...

953
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,730
It just doesn't make any sense.

954
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,630
Wait, is she...

955
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,100
adopted?

956
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:44,110
Have mercy.

957
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,710
The path is treacherous.

958
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,450
Please be careful on your way down.

959
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,020
We're so grateful
for your hospitality.

960
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,880
I'll wire the money
for the roof tiles...

961
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,220
as soon as I get back to Seoul.

962
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:06,700
I don't really have much to say.

963
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,170
You make your own.

964
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,880
Your choices and your actions
become your destiny.

965
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,080
There's no such thing
as a predetermined destiny.

966
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,280
It's all in your hands.

967
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,990
Who asked you for a sermon?

968
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,450
And from where I'm standing,

969
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,790
you've made a really good choice.

970
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,390
You've got nothing to worry about.

971
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,930
Says the phony monk who acts
like he knows everything.

972
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,370
I'm going now. Take care.

973
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,770
Yes, goodbye.

974
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:51,540
And if I text, make sure you answer.
I get worried.

975
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,410
I'm leaving now.

976
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,450
Don't get sick!

977
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,880
And make sure you eat.

978
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,390
I'm off.

979
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:04,450
Bye!

980
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,160
Bye!

981
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,160
Let's go.

982
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,130
Bye!

983
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,740
Where exactly are we going?

984
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,610
- The bus terminal...
- It doesn't matter where.

985
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,380
- What?
- You guys, listen.

986
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:31,050
I'm unsure what to do or where to go
once I make some money,

987
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,150
but as long as I'm with you two,

988
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,020
even if we're headed
for rock bottom,

989
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,590
even if we end up in the pits,

990
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,150
I think everything will be okay.

991
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,660
If we just hang in there together,
things will work out somehow.

992
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,230
Because just hanging in there
is half the battle, right?

993
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:48,000
Could we maybe just make it
to the bus terminal?

994
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,870
Why are you being so dramatic?

995
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,210
I'm so sleepy.

996
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,180
Gosh, this is nice.

997
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,180
All that time on that darn roof...

998
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,920
My entire body is killing me.

999
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,750
Let's get you to a doctor.

1000
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,600
Oh, man.

1001
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,570
Gosh.

1002
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,880
(We will now resume service
for the train to the moon)

1003
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,190
What was that?

1004
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,660
Who goes there?

1005
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,190
Who dares play music
in this pit of despair?

1006
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,330
Darn it, I must still be dreaming.

1007
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,870
What?

1008
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:05,510
What?

1009
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,650
This place isn't wretched,
it's rock and roll!

1010
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,020
What?

1011
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,630
It's outer space.

1012
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,110
We're actually in space.

1013
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,110
Are we actually going all the way
to the moon?

1014
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,990
What are you all waiting for?
Strike up the music!

1015
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,370
No way.

1016
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,270
- Hey!
- Okay.

1017
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:11,540
On your feet!

1018
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:24,990
Guitar!

1019
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,160
Oh, yes!

1020
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,340
(Enderion 1,400 dollars)

1021
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,900
You pesky mosquito.

1022
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,870
(Dr. Ham Ji Woo)

1023
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,780
As if I wasn't mad enough.

1024
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,550
Come here. Where'd you go?

1025
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
Darn it!

1026
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,190
There you are.

1027
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,160
(Marron Confectionery)

1028
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,760
A snack subscription service.

1029
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,970
What if we introduced a plan
that lets you share with friends?

1030
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,840
You're proposing a shareable plan?

1031
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,170
Yes. Solo, Friends,
and Family Snack.

1032
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,280
We'd break it down into three tiers.

1033
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,080
If people subscribe together,

1034
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,980
it's more affordable
since they can split the cost.

1035
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,450
And from our perspective,
it's also a great marketing opportunity.

1036
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,520
For example,
a "favorite snack" party...

1037
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,350
for streaming services,

1038
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,190
or "Tastier Together."

1039
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,630
Using various hashtags like these,

1040
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,430
it would connect our brand image
with the customers' memories.

1041
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:26,300
Applause!

1042
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:32,910
That's fantastic, right?

1043
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,280
How did you even think of that?

1044
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,480
The key is preventing cancellations.
Making sure customers stick with it.

1045
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,480
If they're motivated
to work together,

1046
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,080
they're more likely
to keep subscribing.

1047
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,350
The fun of sticking
with it together...

1048
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:46,290
will make them
want to keep subscribing.

1049
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,390
- That's a pretty good idea.
- It's a great idea.

1050
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,860
- What about you, Da Hee?
- Right.

1051
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:54,160
Yes, I think it's a great idea.

1052
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,770
All right, then.

1053
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,140
- Let's move forward with this idea.
- Okay!

1054
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,940
Okay, next! How are we doing
on online marketing?

1055
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,370
Yes, we're in the process of
reaching out to influencers.

1056
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,320
Did you hear about that new project
the marketing team is pushing?

1057
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,920
It's going to be a world of pain
for every department.

1058
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,160
Was it that JDH girl?

1059
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,860
Why make the whole group suffer
for one incompetent person?

1060
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,860
(Hoppang Bite: No hope
for marketing team's new project...)

1061
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,480
Da Hee.

1062
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,950
Could I talk to you for a second?

1063
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,420
With me?

1064
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:53,160
What? What's not true?

1065
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,860
The rumor about Eun Sang.

1066
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,260
You said she made a fortune
and bought a house,

1067
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,330
and kept all the profits
for herself.

1068
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,130
You're the one
who told me the rumor,

1069
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,200
even though you know we're close.

1070
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,400
- No, that's...
- It's not true.

1071
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,600
Because none of it is.

1072
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,810
I'd appreciate it if you stopped
spreading these weird rumors.

1073
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,380
Da Hae, you're misunderstanding.
I didn't mean any harm.

1074
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:17,650
And one more thing, Da Hee.

1075
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,250
The thing is,

1076
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,850
I'm actually dating Ham Ji Woo.

1077
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,490
What?

1078
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,160
That letter,

1079
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,860
I actually wrote it...

1080
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,730
for Ham Ji Woo.

1081
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,670
I was trying to get it back secretly
so no one would see,

1082
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,600
but of course, it had to come out
of the trash can.

1083
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,310
I told you that was a mistake...

1084
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,050
But Da Hae,

1085
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,550
are you suggesting I did that
on purpose?

1086
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,080
Because if you are, I'm a little...

1087
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,390
Let's say you did,

1088
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,850
just hypothetically.

1089
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,990
If this nagging suspicion I have
turns out to be right...

1090
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,030
I mean,

1091
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:10,670
if you're trying to rattle me,
Da Hee,

1092
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:13,470
don't waste your energy.

1093
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:16,910
I won't be rattled.

1094
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,920
Boo!

1095
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,260
- You scared me!
- What are you doing here?

1096
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:37,630
Just hang on a second...

1097
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,630
There's something
I have to tell you.

1098
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,330
Good. I needed to see you too.

1099
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,870
- I was just...
- Can I go first?

1100
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,270
What?

1101
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,110
Sure.

1102
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,170
I've given this a lot of thought.

1103
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,680
Mosquitoes.

1104
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,250
What? I'm sorry, mosquitoes?

1105
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,350
To kill one, you use both hands...

1106
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,620
and clap them together, right?

1107
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,590
In a way, they die to applause.

1108
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,460
And in a way,
I'm actually a little jealous.

1109
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,790
So that's how I'm going to live
from now on.

1110
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,190
Like what?

1111
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,900
- What, like a mosquito?
- Yes.

1112
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,400
I won't waste my life on work I hate
just to die with a bonus.

1113
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,240
When my time comes,

1114
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:25,940
I want to live singing songs I love,
dying to the sound of applause.

1115
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,780
I see. Mosquitoes, applause...

1116
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,310
Da Hae, I'll make you a promise.

1117
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:34,980
My dream might not provide,

1118
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,250
but I will.

1119
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,390
I'll never let you go hungry.

1120
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:42,260
- Thanks a lot.
- And for as long as I possibly can,

1121
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,360
these veins and this handsome face
you love so much,

1122
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:48,100
- I'll maintain them.
- Again, my sincerest thanks.

1123
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:51,430
And I will never, ever
make you cry again.

1124
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:53,540
So...

1125
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,910
- I...
- Hold on. Wait a minute.

1126
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,810
Don't tell me this is a proposal?

1127
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:00,680
Is that the vibe we're going for?

1128
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,780
Why are you bringing this up now,
at work of all places...

1129
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,180
- What I'm trying to say is...
- Da Hae!

1130
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:08,020
- Hey!
- Our crypto's up! It's really up!

1131
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,950
What? For real?

1132
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,530
Da Hae, I'm quitting my job.
I'm out of here.

1133
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:19,930
What?

1134
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,360
Hold on, what?

1135
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,100
Dear deities,

1136
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,710
why is my heart pounding right now?

1137
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,910
Is it because my crypto dream
is finally coming true?

1138
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:38,950
Or is it because he's about to quit
and give up a jackpot of a bonus,

1139
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,680
all for some unrealistic
dream of his?

1140
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:45,960
Dear deities,

1141
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,820
please, just give me an answer.

1142
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,200
(To the Moon)

1143
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,890
Do you really have to go to England?

1144
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,620
You don't want me to go?

1145
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,990
Should I give up on my music again?

1146
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,460
Who said anything
about leaving you behind?

1147
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,830
I think my future lies
outside of this company.

1148
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,030
A business? Please.

1149
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,130
A bit of money gives
you crazy ideas.

1150
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
They're not crazy ideas.

1151
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,230
I've actually done all the research.

1152
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:31,930
What is this?

1153
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,140
A disciplinary hearing?

1154
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,670
Why is the Kang Eun Sang Store
involved?

1155
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,640
- You turned it into a market.
- I'm so sorry.

1156
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,340
Please, forgive me just this once.

1157
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:41,240
It's no use.
I was the one who reported her.

1158
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,610
You did what, Da Hee?

1159
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:44,480
Hoppang Bite.
