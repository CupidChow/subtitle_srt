1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,440
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,570
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,940
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,510
Wait, for real?

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,610
It's for real.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,350
We really just made 3,000 bucks
sitting here?

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,720
- We did!
- No way!

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,190
- That's hot.
- Pull yourself together.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,230
Let's take Thursday and Friday off.

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,730
With the weekend,
that's four days to have fun.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,100
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,400
We have to check if what we earned
is actual money or just crap.

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,200
Let's take a trip and bring Ji Song.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,270
A trip?

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,070
We made some cash,
so I'll flex a little.

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,970
- It's all on me.
- Then I'll get the food.

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,850
Let's really flex this time
and make sure Ji Song comes with us.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,350
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,620
Then I hereby name this trip...

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,790
A Trip with the Average Girls...

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,260
- to Namhae!
- to Namhae!

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,260
Let's try a bite.

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,110
For our trip's itinerary,

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,480
I've planned out
the whole thing perfectly.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,950
What is it?

26
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,250
The Golden Namhae Train.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,150
- What?
- What?

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,290
It goes from Busan Station
to Namhae.

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,860
On a clear day, across the ocean,

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,560
you can see way out
to tiny little islands.

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,460
And best of all,
we can pick oysters.

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,030
We get two kilograms per person.

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,000
We'll make three dollars each.
How awesome is that?

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,600
- Not awesome at all.
- And for dinner...

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
Prepare to be amazed.

36
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,780
There's a dinner show
on the schedule.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,780
A what? A dinner show?

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,850
What is happening right now?

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
What, you don't like it?

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,890
Forget it. Kim Ji Song!

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
You do it.

42
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,490
I've decided to make you
our new tour guide.

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Okay! Then, starting right now,

44
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,230
I'll look up the hottest clubs
in the Busan area.

45
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,730
- Clubs?
- But I can't dance.

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,670
Shouldn't you be worried about
getting past the bouncer first?

47
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,070
You want me to snap your neck?

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,140
Come on, you can just learn
how to dance.

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,340
Don't worry, just follow my lead.

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
Think of it as letting your body
go with the rhythm.

51
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,450
Do a little body roll,

52
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,120
sway with it,
and then put your hands up!

53
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,260
- Hands up.
- Hands up, yes, hands up...

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,790
Come on, why are you all so timid?

55
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,500
Dancing is all about attitude!

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,600
Put your hands up!

57
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,530
- Put your hands up!
- Hands up!

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,770
- Put your hands up!
- Hands up!

59
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Put your hands up!

60
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,770
Put your hands up!

61
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,440
Sorry, about this.

62
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,310
Come on, do the body roll,
and then put your hands up.

63
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,550
Hands up!

64
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,600
Okay. And do the body roll...

65
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,010
The doors are closing.

66
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,880
It'd be weird...

67
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,420
if it were just us two eating, right?

68
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,820
Plus, people would've talked.

69
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,520
So I invited Eun Sang and Ji Song.

70
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,260
But the thing is, when it's just us,

71
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,090
we lose all track of time and space
and end up having fun by ourselves.

72
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,230
So you're going on a trip?

73
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes. We are.

74
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,330
For three days and two nights.

75
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,040
We're planning to party so hard
we might not make it back.

76
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,770
From what I heard, you were planning
to leave it all on the dance floor.

77
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,980
"Put your hands up?"

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,110
We were just messing around.

79
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,620
Besides, there are lots of
other places to go than clubs.

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,650
We have to go to the mountains,
the sea...

81
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,860
We even have to go to the moon.

82
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,860
Sorry? You're going where?

83
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,500
I meant we're going hiking.

84
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,930
They say the view from the ridgeline
is supposed to be amazing right now.

85
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,740
So are the clubs, I hear.

86
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,770
The doors are opening.

87
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,510
You're pretty persistent.

88
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
"Persistent?"

89
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,650
The doors are closing.

90
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,020
Want to see me
get really persistent?

91
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,960
What are we to each other?

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,660
I think my feelings are
pretty obvious.

93
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,200
So at this point, isn't it only fair
for you to tell me how you feel?

94
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,500
I really can't tell how you feel,
Jung Da Hae.

95
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,570
Dr. Ham, you're way too good for me.

96
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,510
So I think
we should just be friends.

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Fifteenth floor.

98
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,210
Why the fifteenth floor?

99
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm going to HR.

100
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,910
To mess up
your performance review...

101
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,020
by reporting
your insubordination and deceit.

102
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,250
- Oh my gosh, are you crazy?
- Canceled.

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
How was I leading you on?

104
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,520
If you played with someone's feelings,
it's called deceit.

105
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,320
And it was your boss too.

106
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,190
Suddenly you're taking
management's side?

107
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,060
Is this a labor dispute
we're having?

108
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,730
Jung Da Hae.

109
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,570
What are we going to be?

110
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,110
Like I said before,
we should just be friends...

111
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,810
Would you just think about it?

112
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,380
Think before you speak for once!
What are you, a parrot?

113
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,850
Why do you keep repeating yourself?

114
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,990
Look.

115
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,330
You're too excited about your trip
to think clearly right now.

116
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,960
So after you get back,
we can calmly...

117
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,800
and slowly figure things out.

118
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,940
You could have at least
let me finish.

119
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,970
- Fifteenth floor.
- Okay, fine!

120
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,940
We'll talk later.
After I get back from my trip,

121
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,880
we can talk about it then.

122
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,950
Labor talks need careful handling.

123
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,790
(Episode 6: The Art of the Flex)

124
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,460
- We're in Namhae!
- Namhae!

125
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,420
For a car that wouldn't start,
this isn't half bad.

126
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,160
- We saved so much thanks to you.
- Hey, it's the least I could do.

127
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,100
Look at those flowers over there.

128
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,330
The vibes are immaculate!

129
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,940
It's so great, right, guys?

130
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,670
No way!
It went up another 150 dollars!

131
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,610
Yes! Nice!

132
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Gosh, you guys, seriously!

133
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,250
Wasn't it bad enough in Seoul?
Must you talk about crypto here too?

134
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,550
Come on, it's just that
crypto is doing so well right now.

135
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,050
You should stop being so stubborn
and get in on it, okay?

136
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,620
The sooner you get in,
the more money you'll make.

137
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,260
I told you.

138
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,190
Bring up crypto again,
and we're going home.

139
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,100
- I'm getting out.
- Okay!

140
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,430
All right,
we won't say another word.

141
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,100
So, where are we off to first?

142
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,070
First, we should get
something to eat.

143
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,940
Okay, if you look here,

144
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,940
I made a full itinerary
for our trip.

145
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,610
What? "The Namhae Trip Itinerary?"

146
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,450
Oh my gosh, will you look at
how organized she is?

147
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,220
And she's never this organized
when it comes to work.

148
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,420
So what's on the menu?

149
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,720
(Namhae Sea Table,
Bluefin Tuna Course, Assorted Course)

150
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,900
It's a hot spot, so I booked ahead.
But it is a bit pricey, right?

151
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,230
We could just leave now if you want.

152
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Let's do it!

153
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,100
Really?

154
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,940
We came all this way
to splurge for once, didn't we?

155
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,640
You've got to know how to spend it
to know how to earn it.

156
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,380
Exactly. We've spent our whole lives
pinching pennies.

157
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,220
It's okay to flex like this
once in a while.

158
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,690
So, in that spirit,

159
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,790
let's go
with the Bluefin Tuna Course.

160
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,260
Let's not!

161
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,390
- What?
- What?

162
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,860
Hey, if we get that, we'll have to
live on air for the next two days.

163
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,870
We can go big,
but let's not lose our minds.

164
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,330
You think so?

165
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,070
The flounder should be good too.

166
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,170
All right.

167
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Okay, let's try that again.

168
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,310
To the Flounder Course.

169
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,550
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

170
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,820
- Let's go.
- Let's eat!

171
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,590
- Team Chojang!
- Team Chojang!

172
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,310
Here, try this too.

173
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,710
What? Sir, isn't this wild abalone?

174
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,580
But we didn't order this.

175
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,710
It's on the house.

176
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,280
It's great seeing you
enjoy your meal.

177
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,380
It's our most popular dish,
so I wanted you to try some.

178
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Really?

179
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,460
Oh my goodness.
We are so grateful. Truly grateful.

180
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,630
Completely, absolutely, thank you.
Thank you very much!

181
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,030
Don't mind her.
She's our resident weirdo.

182
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,630
She doesn't bite.

183
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,330
- Thank you, sir.
- Enjoy.

184
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,370
- I can't believe he...
- Thank you!

185
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,000
- Isn't this way too much?
- This is amazing.

186
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,070
Well, hello there!

187
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,420
- Gosh, I got something in my teeth.
- Do you want a toothpick?

188
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,060
Goodness.

189
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,490
It's not every day...

190
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,990
you get the luxury
of abalone stuck in your teeth.

191
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,160
Why are you in such a hurry
to pick it out?

192
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,800
Gosh, you're so gross
that I can't hang out with you.

193
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,960
So, is it good?

194
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Yes, whatever.

195
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Let's go on ahead to the car.

196
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,170
I want to check our crypto
before Ji Song gets back.

197
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,210
Good idea. Let's go.

198
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,510
Okay, let's see.

199
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,810
Oh, wait. Hold on.

200
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,920
What? What's going on?

201
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,520
- Did it dip a little?
- Yes, it dropped.

202
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,660
- No way.
- But it's not a huge drop.

203
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,220
It won't keep dropping like this,
will it?

204
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,960
No, don't worry.
It's probably temporary.

205
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,290
That's so weird.

206
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,400
It was trending up,
so why did it drop?

207
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,410
Seriously, just use a toothpick.
That's so gross.

208
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
What are you talking about?

209
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,980
Gosh, stop smacking your lips.
You just keep doing it.

210
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,050
- When was I smacking my lips?
- This whole time.

211
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,450
Wait a minute.

212
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,090
Who are you?
What are you doing in my car?

213
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,830
- I don't think this is our car!
- This must be their car!

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,770
Shut up and get out!

215
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,200
- We're so sorry!
- Sorry!

216
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,070
- What's with them? Are they crazy?
- Sorry!

217
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,650
Give me your phones.

218
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,020
- I promise I won't look.
- Right.

219
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,820
I really won't look again.

220
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,990
It dipped, so I peeked for a second.
That's all.

221
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,190
Sure, you won't.

222
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,420
If I left it up to you,

223
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,690
you'd still be on
that crypto train on the boat...

224
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,490
and even while we're hiking.

225
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,560
You're driving me crazy!

226
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm telling you, we won't look.

227
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,300
Right. Whatever Ji Song wants,
Ji Song gets.

228
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,870
So give them to me.

229
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,170
I just want to be fully present
with you guys on this trip.

230
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,170
That's what I really want to do.

231
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,140
I'll hold on to them until tonight.
Now, give them to me.

232
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,210
Darn it.

233
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,950
- Wait, I got a text from Dr. Ham...
- Give it to me.

234
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,250
Okay, fine. Here.

235
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
So now what? What's up next?

236
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,530
What do you think?

237
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,340
Now the real fun begins.

238
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,710
Alright, then. Let's have a blast.

239
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,110
- Here you go.
- Alright, let me see.

240
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,580
- It's the ocean!
- Hello!

241
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,720
- Gosh, look over there!
- Yahoo!

242
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,750
Look at that!

243
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,860
Okay, everyone, look here!

244
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,660
Ready? One, two, three!

245
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,530
Let's spin!

246
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
It's so refreshing out here.

247
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
- How's this?
- That's the one.

248
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,650
Hey, guys! What do you say
we get matching ones?

249
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,220
- Perfect, there are three.
- Dibs on the purple one.

250
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,420
Yellow? Then I guess I'll take pink.

251
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,930
No way!

252
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,110
This is crazy!

253
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,380
- Amazing.
- This is insane.

254
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Ta-da!

255
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,960
I always want to soothe
my back when I go in warm water.

256
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,960
She looks like
a competitor in "Dream Team."

257
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,770
She's more like
"Idol Star Athletic Championships,"

258
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,970
and not the "Dream Team."

259
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Oh, is that right?

260
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,340
- What's that look for?
- What?

261
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,480
You look like you're in one of those
emotional troop reunion videos.

262
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,680
You have the exact face of a private
looking for his mom in the crowd.

263
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,310
That old reunion show.

264
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,280
Gosh, so annoying.
I get it, darn it.

265
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,750
What? Why?

266
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,720
My mom gets cupping done a lot, too.

267
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,420
Seeing you just reminded me of her.

268
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,460
On days when I feel like I've spent
a little too much money,

269
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,000
for some reason, I always end up
thinking about my mom.

270
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,370
Why?

271
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,930
You feel guilty?

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,770
Because your mom works to the bone,
and gets cupping for all her aches,

273
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,340
and you feel like you're out there,
blowing money on whatever?

274
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,480
Gosh, I don't know.
When I spend money, I think of her.

275
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,850
Just enjoy yourself.

276
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,090
All moms feel the same way.

277
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,760
The good things they missed out on,
all the places they couldn't go,

278
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,190
and all the good things
the world has to offer...

279
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,690
They want their daughters
to have it all.

280
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,330
So just have an absolute blast!

281
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,100
Live the life your mom would want.
Don't give it a second thought.

282
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,010
You think so?

283
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,910
But are you speaking as a daughter
or as a mother?

284
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,950
I'm just speaking as a drunk.

285
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,080
I knew it.

286
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,020
Hey, Kim Ji Song!
Let's go get another round!

287
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,230
What for?
Let's hang out here longer!

288
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Hey, can I get my phone back
for just a second?

289
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,030
There's something important
I need to tell my mom. Please?

290
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,100
I haven't even been able to
check my texts from Dr. Ham.

291
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,740
Hey, give it here! Give it to me!

292
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,180
Mom, it's me.

293
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,350
It's your darling daughter.

294
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,490
My phone? Oh, I didn't lose it.

295
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,330
It's the whole situation I'm in.

296
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,690
Have I eaten?

297
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,030
Of course I have.

298
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,700
The food here is delicious,
the ocean is beautiful,

299
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,300
and most of all,
the people are so nice.

300
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,110
They'll just take a picture
for tourists like us,

301
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,210
and they put so much care into it.

302
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
Oh, right.

303
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,780
This guy offered to take our picture
and make our legs look longer,

304
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,380
and I'm telling you,

305
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,720
he lay down flat on the ground
just to get the shot.

306
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,120
Oh, and the restaurants
are so generous too.

307
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,660
They kept giving us free things.
Even abalone!

308
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,860
So you have to come with us
next time, Mom.

309
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,540
You should stay at a fancy hotel,
eat a fancy meal,

310
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,270
and enjoy a million-dollar view.

311
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,810
You deserve at least one day
to rest like that. Right?

312
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,880
Your daughter...

313
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,750
will make lots of money
and treat you like a queen...

314
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,690
Mom, are you crying?

315
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,330
Oh, you're brushing your teeth?

316
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,160
You're going to bed,
so you want me to hang up?

317
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,100
Mom, but weren't you
even a little bit moved?

318
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,410
Why are you cursing at me?

319
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,310
Goodness.

320
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,480
Can I have my phone back now?
Please?

321
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,780
What are you staring at?

322
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,750
It's nothing.

323
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,920
Da Hae was boasting to her mom
that she'd treat her like a queen.

324
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,260
I know
it's just the alcohol talking,

325
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,230
but I still envy her confidence.

326
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,030
You should tell Wei Lin that too.
That you'll treat him like a king.

327
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,270
And how am I supposed to do that?

328
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,510
I'm not a secret long-lost heiress
to some conglomerate, right?

329
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
There's no way for me to do that.

330
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,410
Get into crypto.

331
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
Seriously.

332
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,750
What are you,
a crypto ambassador now?

333
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,180
Are you getting a commission
or something?

334
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,820
It's the only chance people like us,
who weren't born rich,

335
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,020
have to make our lives better.

336
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,990
A face mask would do you some good.
I'll put an aloe mask on you later.

337
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,600
I doubt you borrowed that clunker
just to buy aloe masks,

338
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
so where'd you get
that piece of junk?

339
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,440
What did you blow your money on...

340
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,310
that you couldn't afford a rental?

341
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,650
I borrowed the car from my cousin,

342
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,620
and I splurged on a surfboard.

343
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,920
The waves have just been
too good lately.

344
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,760
Honey.

345
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,060
The waves you should worry about
are the coming waves of inflation.

346
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,260
The infla-wave?
What are you talking about?

347
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,630
You just keep blowing your money
on stuff like that, all "YOLO."

348
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,330
And then Doom will say, "Hello"
and take over your life.

349
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,440
You were going "YOLO" and flexing.

350
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,140
Why do you always pick on me?

351
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,270
Right back at you!
Mega bounce back!

352
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,310
Crystal bounce back!
Super-ultra backhole bounce back!

353
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,750
- Gosh. This is so embarrassing.
- Right back at you!

354
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,990
Hey, how can you act just like
a five-year-old?

355
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,990
Whenever I see you,
it's like a dam breaks...

356
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,190
and the nagging
just comes pouring out.

357
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,990
- Right back at you!
- Just sit down already. Sit down.

358
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,830
Do you think your reckless spending
is a worthwhile indulgence?

359
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,970
A worthwhile indulgence?

360
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,800
As if you'd understand.

361
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,310
I know little tricks
like this though.

362
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,880
Da Hae, you can get up now.

363
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,420
So...

364
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,220
That's not bad.
You're sharper than you look.

365
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,430
- Tteokbokki.
- Tteokbokki.

366
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,060
Don't underestimate me.

367
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,530
Now just mix the drinks.

368
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,770
Alright, a glass for everyone.
Here we go.

369
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,170
- Tonight, the party doesn't...
- Stop!

370
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,520
What time is it?

371
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,690
Eun Sang.

372
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,990
Ji Song. Hey, wake up.

373
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,300
- My stomach is killing me.
- How much did we drink last night?

374
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,700
Gosh, who knows?
This one kept pushing us to drink.

375
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,300
I was bummed out
that we couldn't go to the club.

376
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,770
You said you knew a hot club,

377
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,110
but I checked,
and they were all shut down.

378
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,540
Just give me my phone already.

379
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,310
In my bag over there.

380
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,820
Okay, let's see...

381
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,160
- Hey, it's not in here.
- What?

382
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,260
- Seriously, where did you put it?
- It's not there?

383
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,100
- It's gone?
- I don't know!

384
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,310
I've tried calling all the numbers
you gave me,

385
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,080
but all three phones are off.

386
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,040
Darn it.

387
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,520
Gosh, Eun Sang. What is it?

388
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,690
- Did you remember something?
- I had it at the seafood place,

389
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,320
- Right.
- and then I used it at the cafe.

390
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,030
This is driving me crazy.

391
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,270
You spent money everywhere,
so you can't even narrow it down.

392
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,440
Da Hae.

393
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,640
Hey! Did you check the bar?
What'd they say?

394
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,380
It's not there.
They said nothing was turned in.

395
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,510
Gosh, darn it.

396
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,350
Why did you have to collect
all our phones?

397
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,120
How was I supposed to know
this would happen?

398
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,490
What? What is it?
Did you just remember something?

399
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
No, it's just...

400
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,230
Remember that text from Dr. Ham?
I wonder what it was about.

401
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,800
- Seriously? At a time like this...
- No, I just...

402
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,400
I know this probably isn't the time,
but...

403
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,470
Then don't say it!

404
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,640
The trail entrance has set hours,
and we have to leave now.

405
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,040
Maybe we can find our phones later
and just head out now?

406
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,580
Right, okay.
I mean, we told them about it,

407
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,320
so the desk'll call us
if they turn up.

408
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,280
We came all this way, after all.
Eun Sang, let's go.

409
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,920
No, we have to find
our phones first.

410
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,990
Come on, let's just go. Please?

411
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,590
We'll miss the flowers
at Mount Deoksu, Eun Sang.

412
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,260
We have to go now.

413
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,690
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go!

414
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
- But...
- Let's go.

415
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,830
- Let's go. Here's your bag.
- Fine.

416
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,570
Let's go!
Let's go see the flowers! Come on!

417
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,610
When's it supposed to rain?
Someone check the forecast.

418
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,780
Right. We don't have our phones.

419
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,620
I wonder what that text was.

420
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,690
Should we listen to some music?
Just pull up YouTube.

421
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,990
Right. The phones.

422
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,590
Gosh, what could it have been?

423
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,730
We can just listen to the radio.
The good old radio.

424
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,670
"Amor Fati"!
Your favorite song, Eun Sang.

425
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,810
<i>Life is now!</i>

426
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,450
<i>- Amor...</i>
- We'll be back after a short break.

427
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,450
This program is brought to you by
Gimjinsa House's Number One Ribs.

428
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,650
- We'll pick a few lucky texters...
- Ribs...

429
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
That sounds so good.

430
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,790
For some delicious ribs,
so keep those texts coming.

431
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,530
Since then, crypto market volatility
has been alarming.

432
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,260
I bet our investors won't be
getting any sleep tonight.

433
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,800
On that note,
let's listen to this next song.

434
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,900
"Regret" by Jo Sung Mo.

435
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,070
Wait, what did the DJ just say?
"Alarming volatility?"

436
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,540
So, does that mean investors
are too excited or upset to sleep?

437
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,880
And why play the song "Regret?"

438
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,880
Do they regret investing?

439
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,150
Or do they regret not investing?

440
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,790
Eun Sang, don't tell me
the price dropped even more.

441
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,860
Hey, check the news!
See if there are any new articles!

442
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,990
Check the news with what?

443
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Right.
What if we call the station and ask?

444
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,630
- With what phone?
- Seriously.

445
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,830
Darn it.

446
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,540
Eun Sang!

447
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,010
What are you doing?

448
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,540
Who has time for flowers right now?
I need to get to a PC cafe.

449
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,640
I have to see what's going on.

450
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,850
A PC cafe is not on my itinerary.

451
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,750
And we can take our time to find it.

452
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,480
Take our time?
What if it crashes in the meantime?

453
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,920
Just think of it as a sign
from above to quit crypto.

454
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,420
No deity has any business
sending me signs.

455
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,490
Unless he's here to apologize.

456
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,230
What are you even talking about?
Just turn the car around already!

457
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,830
Look, if you don't get it,
then just stay out of it!

458
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,000
Come on, you two, stop fighting.
You're giving me a headache.

459
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,300
Hey! Watch out!

460
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,270
Hey! Watch where you're going!

461
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,610
Look who's talking!
You came out of nowhere.

462
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,710
Excuse me?
Who do you think you're talking to?

463
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,110
- You!
- Eun Sang.

464
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,250
Let's just go.
This is going to turn into a fight.

465
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,920
Move your car!
I need to get to a PC cafe!

466
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,320
Stop it. That's enough.

467
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,620
Okay, that's enough. Stop.

468
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,390
- Eun Sang!
- She must be crazy. Let's go.

469
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,660
What was that?
Was that the phone just now?

470
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,930
What?

471
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,070
It's nothing.

472
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,370
Why are they in here?

473
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,440
Did you hide our phones?

474
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,220
The truth is that
I found it at the bar.

475
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,930
I was going to give it back to you
right away.

476
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,860
But then I thought,

477
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,670
You thought what?

478
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,370
You two were always on your phones.

479
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,470
Without them,
it finally felt like a real trip.

480
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,180
If you'd had your phones,
you'd just be checking your crypto.

481
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,510
That's why I told you
to get in on it with us.

482
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,080
Do you have any idea how much money
we're making off of this?

483
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,790
Seriously, it's always money with you.
Give it a rest.

484
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,250
Do you know how pathetic
you both look...

485
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,320
going on about money like that?

486
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,520
What? Pathetic?

487
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,090
Hey, Kim Ji Song.
You'd better watch your mouth.

488
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,660
What did I say wrong?

489
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,300
It's not like
I'm making this stuff up.

490
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,670
You're the pathetic one here.

491
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,770
What did you just say?

492
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,900
Am I wrong?

493
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,070
Da Hae and I
didn't even need to get into crypto.

494
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,040
If we'd just kept working,
our salaries would've gone up a bit,

495
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,950
and maybe become
assistant managers one day.

496
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,120
I'm so jealous.

497
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,420
But while we were climbing up,

498
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,450
earning titles
like manager and assistant manager,

499
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,960
what were you going to be doing?

500
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,720
I'm not interested in promotions.

501
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,090
I'm fine with the way things are.

502
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,430
Right.

503
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,560
Of course,
that pathetic pride of yours...

504
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,830
You'd say things like, "I'm fine,"
or "I'm not greedy for money,"

505
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,870
but you know the truth.

506
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,110
It's not that you're not ambitious.

507
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,910
It's that you have no future.

508
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,610
Stop.

509
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,880
You know it too. That's why you...

510
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,010
waste all your money
like it's your last day to live.

511
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,850
Because you know it's hopeless
to even try.

512
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,950
Because dreaming of
a better tomorrow...

513
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,690
Because you could never even dare
to dream of it.

514
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,630
Because you're an O.O.

515
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,330
What?

516
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,400
What do you mean, Ji Song's an O.O.?

517
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,000
You knew?

518
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,110
Wait a minute, what's going on?
What is it?

519
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,310
- Then how long have you known...
- You're repulsive.

520
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
What?

521
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,280
You knew all along
and pretended you didn't know.

522
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,380
That's so repulsive.

523
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,950
Then what was this trip about?

524
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,820
What, you wanted to give me charity?

525
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,090
Don't worry.

526
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,820
I didn't spend enough
to call it charity.

527
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,890
I said I don't buy worthless things.

528
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,230
Eun Sang.

529
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,870
I'm sorry.

530
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,700
I guess I was being oblivious.

531
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,840
I'll get out of your way now.

532
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,480
So you can stop wasting money on me.

533
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,720
You two have a great time.

534
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,450
- Hey, where are you going?
- Just forget it. Let her go.

535
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,690
Come on.
Why did you say something so cruel?

536
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,200
And I suppose you were
so much nicer?

537
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,830
Gosh, okay, fine. Hold on.

538
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,930
Ji Song!

539
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,400
Ji Song?

540
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,200
Fine. Go on!

541
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,910
Think you're the only ones leaving?
I'm out of here too!

542
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,180
Unbelievable.

543
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,020
She's not even picking up. Goodness.

544
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
It's raining...

545
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,190
Of all the times for it to rain!
Seriously!

546
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,790
Wait a minute.

547
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,590
What?

548
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Hey!

549
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,960
Hey, Ji Song!

550
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,300
Ji Song! Hey! What?

551
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,400
Wait! Hey!

552
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,200
Gosh, I can't believe her!

553
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,510
Hello.

554
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,080
Where can I take you?

555
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,550
That car up there... What?

556
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,750
Gosh, it's already gone.

557
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,020
Darn it.

558
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,960
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

559
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,590
- Where to, ma'am?
- Right...

560
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,730
Just a moment.

561
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,760
Gosh...

562
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,730
Yes, Mount Deokju, please.

563
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,910
(You are now entering
Mount Deokju National Park.)

564
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,280
Gosh, I can't see a single thing!
Darn it.

565
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,480
Come on, please pick up.

566
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,180
Hey, Kim Ji Song!
Why aren't you answering your phone?

567
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,090
Probably because this isn't Ji Song.

568
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,890
- Wait, Eun Sang?
- Ji Song and I switched phones.

569
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,190
Because of our stupid,
similar keychains.

570
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,530
Is that any reason
not to answer the phone?

571
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,630
Whatever.
I'm already at Mount Deokju.

572
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,630
If you have any conscience at all,
you'll get over here.

573
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,940
My conscience took a job
in the Middle East a long time ago.

574
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,610
If you find that brat,
tell her to bring me my phone.

575
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,780
Hello? Gosh, Kang Eun Sang!

576
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,580
Darn it.

577
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,580
Gosh, why'd she leave the car?
Does she expect me to drive it home?

578
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,350
Gosh...

579
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,030
(Eun Sang, Da Hae,
and Ji Song's trip)

580
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,670
(Kim Ji Sang)

581
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,130
(Eun Sang, Da Hae,
and Ji Song's trip)

582
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,090
(Eun Sang)

583
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,500
Hey, Kim Ji Song! Where are you?

584
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,570
How did you know
it was me right away?

585
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,000
Cut the crap!

586
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,940
I'm at Mount Deokju,
so get here now.

587
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,770
Are you really going to ruin
our trip like this?

588
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,280
The trip isn't ruined, my heart is.
So, I'm afraid that's not happening.

589
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,840
Hey!
You were the one who planned this.

590
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,650
I came all the way here
because you planned it!

591
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,080
Sorry, but this is Eun Sang's phone,
so I can't talk for long.

592
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,520
She'll nitpick about something
for that.

593
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,520
I'm just a nobody to her anyway!

594
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,530
Darn it, hey!

595
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,530
Gosh, I can't with them. Seriously.

596
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,630
Now what?
Which way am I supposed to go?

597
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,620
This is insane...

598
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,270
(Ham Ji Woo)

599
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,680
- Hello?
- Why didn't you text me back?

600
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:37,810
Right.

601
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,050
It totally slipped my mind.

602
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,020
They just issued a
heavy rain warning.

603
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,550
You didn't go to the mountains,
did you?

604
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,490
Are you seriously on
a mountain right now?

605
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,690
Help me.

606
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,830
Da Hae!

607
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,710
And so...

608
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,250
and she called me pathetic...

609
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,750
and that I was just pitiful...

610
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,050
- She was so awful.
- Ji Song. Don't cry.

611
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,090
- But you keep breaking up.
- What?

612
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,890
It's because this is
Eun Sang's phone.

613
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,400
She must be on
the cheapest data plan.

614
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,200
There's barely any data left.

615
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,740
I'll use her data, then cut her off.

616
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,840
Cut her off?

617
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,040
I won't hang out with her anymore.

618
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,610
Because I was nice and admired her,
she thinks I have no worries...

619
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,710
From now on,
I'm ignoring her, even at work.

620
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Then...

621
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,250
What if you quit your job?
Just quit.

622
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,420
Quit and just hang out with me.
It'll be fun.

623
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,920
We can go see the flowers in spring.

624
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,960
How?

625
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,390
- What?
- No, I mean,

626
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,200
I'd love to hang out with you,

627
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,570
but if I quit my job,
where are we going to get the money?

628
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,570
Wait, are you saying we don't
need to rely on a salary...

629
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,440
because you have passive income
or something?

630
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,410
I just learned this yesterday.

631
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,110
Currently, there's high inflation
and low growth.

632
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,280
A ten-dollar bill
we save this year...

633
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,790
could be worth less than half that
by next year.

634
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,720
Just trying to save a little
here and there...

635
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,590
Wei Lin, you...

636
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,930
did you buy a watch?

637
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,270
What? You noticed?

638
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,400
Nice, right?
Want to get matching ones?

639
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,140
Matching couple's watches. Together?

640
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,900
Together, my foot.

641
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,210
Seriously? Aren't you worried about
the coming wave of inflation at all?

642
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,810
- Ji Song, I don't like nagging.
- What? Nagging?

643
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,250
Always new bags,
shoes, and wallets...

644
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,350
Where do you get the money for that?

645
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,090
Who knows what the future holds?

646
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,250
How could you waste
your money like that?

647
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,990
Whenever I see you,
it's like a dam breaks...

648
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,420
and the nagging
just comes pouring out.

649
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,330
So that's what it was.

650
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,000
For the nagging to just come
pouring out like that,

651
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,270
it must mean
I really care about you.

652
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,310
(Namhae Bus Terminal,
Yongju Village)

653
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,250
(Mount Deokju)

654
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,190
Jung Da Hae.

655
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,520
If I was going to die
like this anyway,

656
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,400
why did I bother
saving money every month?

657
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,570
Ms. Round! Snap out of it!

658
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,000
Ms. Round!

659
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Mr. Ko?

660
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,540
You can't die out here! Get a grip!

661
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,240
You, worried about me?
That's a first.

662
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,610
Is this a dream?

663
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,180
If you die,

664
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,850
I'll have no one to pick on at work.

665
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,460
Da Hae!

666
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,730
Da Hae, you need to snap out of it.
You can't die here.

667
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,230
- Da Hee?
- Even if life seems worthless,

668
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,700
even if you feel like
you're in the gutter,

669
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,030
you can never give up.

670
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,240
Is she trying to insult me?

671
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,970
I'm sorry, Da Hae.
I didn't mean any harm.

672
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,910
That felt pretty malicious to me.

673
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,010
Hey, you can't fall asleep.

674
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,650
Instead of me,

675
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,720
think about the person
you really want to see right now.

676
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,520
Why don't you think of that person?

677
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,220
Maybe that will help.

678
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,350
Someone I want to see?

679
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,460
Jung Da Hae.

680
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,530
What is this now?

681
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,400
Even Dr. Ham now?

682
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,690
Are you hurt?

683
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,890
Can you get up?

684
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,530
No.

685
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,610
Get on my back.

686
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,360
Gosh, darn it.

687
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,530
My conscience...

688
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,460
picked a really bad time to show up.

689
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,100
Gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

690
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,370
Where is Da Hae?
She's not even answering her phone.

691
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,770
Darn it.

692
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,440
(Assistant Manager Jo)

693
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,250
Gosh, why is she calling now?

694
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,820
(Assistant Manager Jo Su Jin)

695
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,480
Hello? Is this Kim Ji Song?

696
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,750
This isn't her.

697
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,460
Isn't this Kim Ji Song's phone?

698
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,990
Well, it is her phone.

699
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,160
What is that supposed to mean?

700
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,300
So is it her or not?

701
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,500
- I'm so busy too. Darn it.
- Just tell me. I'll pass it along.

702
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,000
Okay, fine.

703
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,310
Can you ask Kim Ji Song
where this month's account chart is?

704
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,310
Also, ask if Mr. Ko got
the corporate card expense report.

705
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,140
Mr. Ko is on vacation today.

706
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,420
The nerve, taking a day off
when even the new hires haven't yet.

707
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,020
- I'm not doing that.
- What?

708
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,460
You should watch your own attitude.

709
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,390
What gives you the right to call
and cuss me out?

710
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,690
Do you have a mouth full of razors?

711
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Excuse me?

712
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,600
And another thing.
Is vacation just for Mr. Ko?

713
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,200
Kim Ji Song's on vacation too!

714
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,740
You have no manners calling someone
on their day off about work.

715
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,540
Were you raised in a barn?

716
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,580
Listen to you.
Seriously, who is this?

717
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,680
Who do you think you are?

718
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,110
I'm Kim Ji Song's mother!

719
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,350
What do you think you're doing?

720
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,930
This trip has been
absolutely perfect.

721
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,040
What are you, a masochist?

722
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,440
You were stranded,
and you're saying this was the best?

723
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,080
I'm serious.

724
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,850
Ji Song and Eun Sang had a fight,
so things got a little rocky,

725
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,590
but on the whole,
it's all been great.

726
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,620
And now, to top it all off,
this dream is just perfect.

727
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
A dream?

728
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,400
You're supposed to be in Seoul,

729
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,760
but you're right here
in front of me.

730
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,900
What else could this be but a dream?

731
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,140
I need to wake up.

732
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,970
Come on.

733
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,240
Wait a minute.

734
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,540
If it's a dream,
why do you want to wake up?

735
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,050
Am I not even allowed to be
in your dreams, Da Hae?

736
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,150
- No, it's not like that.
- Then what is it?

737
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,850
It's just that on this trip,

738
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,120
I realized
how fun spending money is.

739
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,690
It was just so fun to spend
without a care in the world.

740
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,600
Now that I know that feeling...

741
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,130
But still,
I want to savor this dream of you.

742
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
What?

743
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,140
You, Dr. Ham,

744
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,940
dreaming of you is a special treat
I have to save up for these days.

745
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,420
Even thinking about you,
I feel like I have to ration it,

746
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,620
so I only let myself do it
a little bit at a time.

747
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,360
If my heart races too much at once,
I'm worried it'll be bad for me.

748
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,570
So I do make your heart race.

749
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,010
Of course you do.

750
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,980
Because you're so darn handsome.

751
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,720
You're something else.

752
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,260
Oh, no!
I have to wake up now, for real!

753
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,260
Hey, wait!

754
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,490
- Wait, Da Hae, my neck!
- Let me wake up.

755
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,690
- My neck!
- Let me go!

756
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,930
My neck! Da Hae, my neck!

757
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,030
My tailbone...

758
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,330
What?

759
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,540
This is a dream,
so why do I hurt too?

760
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,010
Dr. Ham. Is this for real?

761
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,750
(Recent Call: Assistant Manager Jo)

762
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,180
Are you out of your mind?

763
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,420
You think I'm the insane one?
Not Assistant Manager Jo?

764
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,090
You're the one who just flipped out
on Ms. Jo with my phone.

765
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,860
Hey, how is that my fault?

766
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,430
You shouldn't call staff on vacation
about work-related stuff.

767
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,200
It's totally out of line.

768
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,100
- But I'm an O.O.
- So what if you are?

769
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,040
An O.O is an indefinite contract.

770
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,570
We're not treated
like regular staff.

771
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,610
Our raises are different,
and so are the holiday bonuses.

772
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,780
During the holidays,
you guys complained about getting...

773
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
a measly fifty-dollar gift card, right?

774
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,150
An O.O. like me?
I don't even get that.

775
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,020
With things being the way they are,
do you really think I can afford to,

776
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,390
and raise chaos like you just did?

777
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,990
Hey, if that's your situation,

778
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,400
isn't that all the more reason
you should get into crypto?

779
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,130
Darn that stupid...
What? What did you say?

780
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,470
If I get into your crypto,
what then?

781
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,900
Will I get invited
to the group chat?

782
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,740
You'll stop caring about it.

783
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,070
Once you start making real money,

784
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,470
you won't care if they invite you
to some stupid group chat.

785
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,840
Your life is more than that chatroom,

786
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,150
in a much bigger and brighter world.

787
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,980
Sure, it is.

788
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,650
You want to talk about brilliant?
That would be Wei Lin's eyes.

789
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,990
And the way his teeth gleam
when he laughs.

790
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,260
Are you that obsessed with looks?

791
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,030
Good looks don't last forever.

792
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,530
Even if Wei Lin is
a pathetic human being.

793
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,330
He's the man I snagged amid a global
shortage of handsome men, all right?

794
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,470
He's a diamond. During Stagflation,
you couldn't buy him for any price!

795
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:39,570
You...

796
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,540
You little brat.

797
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,880
You've been studying.

798

801
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,130
No, I haven't.

802
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,290
My gosh.

803
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,630
My gosh!

804
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,000
I feel like a proud mom
whose kid went from 300th to 299th.

805
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,470
I'm so proud of you.
You amazing little brat.

806
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,170
Get away from me. Get away!

807
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
My brilliant brat!

808
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,740
Get away from me. Get away!

809
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,790
Hey, hold on tight!

810
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,390
Let me go!

811
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,260
You think I'm just going to let go?

812
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,230
I would if I were you!

813
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,330
That's real noble of you.
You disloyal little brat.

814
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,330
We're both going to fall! Eun Sang!

815
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,770
Ji Song!

816
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,100
Ji Song!

817
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,240
And what is this supposed to be?

818
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,740
- Hey, hurry up...
- Eun Sang!

819
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:50,910
- Hurry!
- Eun Sang!

820
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,710
Da Hae.

821
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,320
What's going on here?

822
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,480
Hey, questions later. Just pull!

823
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,650
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

824
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
What in the world?

825
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,500
Hey.
Are vacations always this eventful?

826
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,270
Exactly. Next time,
we're taking the train...

827
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,740
you mentioned to us.

828
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,580
And watch the dinner show
in one piece.

829
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,420
But I think I must've hit my head
when I fell.

830
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,620
Because now I'm starting
to see things.

831
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,690
Isn't that Dr. Ham?

832
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,990
Of all people to run into here,
it has to be my boss.

833
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,530
- What kind of nightmare is this?
- Are you all okay?

834
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,760
Good grief, what is it with you?

835
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:44,830
He's talking to us!

836
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,730
Of course I am.
I was asking if you're okay.

837
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:50,340
I thought I was dreaming
until a second ago, too.

838
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,670
Alright!

839
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,910
Let's get it together
and just do what we practiced.

840
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,410
It's about to come up.

841
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,420
There it is! It's up!

842
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,460
What are you doing? Get up!
Come on, let's do this!

843
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,220
Come on, you know the one.
The thing we did that one time.

844
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,630
The routine we practiced.

845
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,830
Put your hands up!

846
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,530
Come on! Put your hands up!

847
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,970
- Put your, put your hands up!
- Right!

848
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,170
- Okay!
- Put your hands up!

849
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,310
- Put your hands up!
- Jump!

850
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:31,650
- Put your hands up!
- Put your hands up!

851
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,450
- Put your hands up!
- Over here!

852
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,920
(Namhae Jin Clinic)

853
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,200
Eun Sang!
Are you awake? Are you feeling okay?

854
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,840
What? What happened?

855
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,640
I got hurt and Ji Song fell,
so why are you the one who fainted?

856
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,640
- I fainted?
- Yes.

857
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,040
The rescuers
on the helicopter said...

858
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:07,910
your cochlea and the part that
handles your sense of balance...

859
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,920
are weak, so you could suddenly
pass out like that.

860
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,120
In English?
So why exactly did I pass out?

861
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,520
- It's because you're old.
- Darn it.

862
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,930
You had us worried.

863
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,930
I thought you were going to die.

864
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,070
Like I'd die... Hey, let go of me.

865
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,170
You were right about everything.

866
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,380
I'm a complete and total mess.
Nothing in my life has gone right.

867
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,280
Where's this suddenly coming from?

868
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,120
Hey, I wasn't that harsh, was I?

869
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,180
That's why...

870
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,690
That's why I hated
the idea of crypto.

871
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,490
You guys are all I have.

872
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,430
But then you...

873
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,200
kept leaving me behind,

874
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,700
and it felt like you were
taking off without me.

875
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,970
That's the whole point.

876
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,170
We want you to do it with us.

877
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,680
But I'm scared.

878
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,780
- What?
- That my life...

879
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,380
is so messed up that I have to cling
to a fad like that,

880
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,950
admitting that it's ruined.

881
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,890
That's what scares me.

882
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,030
We do this so we don't get ruined,
not because we are ruined.

883
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,230
But my life is ruined!

884
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,890
It is ruined,
so why are you arguing?

885
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,630
It's a disaster.
A total, undeniable dumpster fire.

886
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,230
Do you have any idea how high
my credit card bill is this month?

887
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,470
What, from the surfboard?
Come on, you only bought one thing.

888
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,110
Why are you being so dramatic...

889
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:42,240
- Right.
- I also bought a rash guard for it.

890
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,680
And a pair of shoes,

891
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,150
and a hat,

892
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,450
and a bag.

893
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,920
See? It's not one thing.
Why do you keep saying that?

894
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,960
And when I snapped out of it,
I'd booked a flight to Guam, too.

895
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,020
Oh, dear.

896
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,820
The thing is...

897
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,060
I've been crashing at a 24-hour spa
for the last three days.

898
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,400
- Da Hae.
- Yes?

899
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,740
- Up my dose on the sedative.
- What?

900
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,110
Just knock me out.
Or I'm going to strangle her.

901
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,740
Okay, hold on. Got it.

902
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,780
Who told you to spend
that much money?

903
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,310
Save the lecture.
I don't want to hear it.

904
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,550
Right back at you!

905
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,250
Hey, knock it off!
This is a hospital. Be quiet.

906
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:30,460
What's become of my life?
What am I going to do?

907
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,590
Hey, be quiet!

908
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,230
Unbelievable.

909
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,200
Hey, you. Seriously.

910
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,970
Do you have to act
like a five-year-old?

911
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:49,010
Why do you keep treating
me like I'm five?

912
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,380
You, Kim Ji Song.

913
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,150
Because I...

914
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,980
know a five-year-old
who's the spitting image of you.

915
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,520
How about I tell you her story
while the drugs kick in?

916
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:06,790
This kid...

917
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,030
is a little girl
who just turned five.

918
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,540
(Fairy Calia)

919
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,340
She was just starting
to learn to write,

920
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,370
but she couldn't quite spell
her own name correctly.

921
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,410
- She'd always get one letter wrong.
- It's so hot.

922
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,010
So her name,

923
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,310
- which was Ji Sang...
- What's this?

924
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,420
Did you write your name?

925
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,850
One day, it would
come out as "Ji Seung,"

926
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,120
and another day,
it'd even become "Ji Song."

927
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:37,720
When did our little girl's
name become Ji Song?

928
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,790
I guess we'll have to call you
Ji Song from now on.

929
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,730
Once she learned...

930
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:43,730
- to write her name,
- Kim Ji Song.

931
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,730
her parents had promised
to take her to an amusement park.

932
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,840
Her dad was a truck driver,

933
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,670
and her mom was always busy
cleaning grills at a restaurant,

934
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,310
so they didn't have much
time to spend with her.

935
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,050
So in her little mind,

936
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,420
if she could
just get her name right,

937
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,490
she thought she could finally spend
a lot of time with her mom and dad.

938
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,590
(Kim Ji Si)

939
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,320
We left half an hour ago,
and it's already this backed up.

940
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:13,490
Wednesday?

941
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,400
My husband works on Wednesdays,
so I have to watch our kid.

942
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,670
What about Friday? Okay.

943
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,240
Ji Sang.
That's dangerous. Sit down. Sit up.

944
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,540
Ji Sang, sit up straight.

945
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,170
No, it's fine.

946
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,310
Okay, I'll see you then.
What about the pay?

947
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,680
As long as the hourly rate is good,
I'm fine with it.

948
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,710
So on the days...

949
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,380
when it looked like
she'd finally written her name right,

950
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,220
the poor parents' hearts
would just sink.

951
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,790
This stroke sticks out
a bit too much here.

952
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,490
And this looks more like
a circle than a square.

953
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,190
- Right. Darn it.
- And from then on,

954
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,030
- That was so close. It's such a shame.
- they'd find fault with...

955
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,700
- Nope. Try again.
- whatever she wrote.

956
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,870
Apparently, the kid would even sob
in her sleep sometimes.

957
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,410
Now, don't you go crying
over something like that.

958
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,880
It was just one stroke.

959
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,840
Just one little stroke
was drawn wrong.

960
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:06,450
It's not that we don't want to go,
it's just...

961
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,650
Maybe we should try to make time?

962
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,760
We should. She wants to go so badly.

963
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,300
Then one day,

964
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:31,000
it was raining hard,
just like today.

965
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,450
The little girl breathed
on the window...

966
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,580
and wrote her name in the fog.

967
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,120
Kim Ji Sang.

968
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,020
Perfectly, without a single mistake.

969
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,520
Finally.

970
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,230
So? Did they go
to the amusement park?

971
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,330
They must have gone after that,
right?

972
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:57,830
No.

973
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,530
They couldn't.

974
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
Why not?

975
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,110
Because they saw it in the car
on their way back from burying her.

976
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,880
(Kim Ji Sang)

977
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,380
(Kim Ji Sang)

978
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,760
It was an accident.

979
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,330
Her preschool bus crashed
into a guardrail.

980
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,740
If only they'd had
a little more time,

981
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,070
they would've had so many chances
to praise her.

982
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,340
If only they'd had more money,

983
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,410
she could have had so many more
wonderful experiences.

984
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,650
The mother, who regretted...

985
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,620
the moments
she could never get back,

986
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,190
was just barely going through
the motions of living.

987
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,270
Until one day, like a miracle,
she met them again.

988
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,800
Those two little strokes.

989
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,170
They weren't failures.

990
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,140
They were just strokes
that weren't finished yet.

991
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,850
They weren't drawn wrong.

992
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,780
They were just clumsy,

993
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,950
very slowly,

994
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,490
and carefully drawn lines
that were still a work in progress.

995
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,160
So you see, Kim Ji Song.

996
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,560
What makes you think
you're a failure?

997
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,470
You have endless possibilities.
You can be whatever you want to be.

998
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,900
You're still a work in progress.

999
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,800
Isn't it a little premature...

1000
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,610
to call yourself a failure?

1001
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,140
You're right.

1002
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,450
It is.

1003
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,220
I'm not ready
to call myself a failure.

1004
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,220
Listen,

1005
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,460
I...

1006
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,430
still don't know the first thing
about crypto,

1007
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,130
but I'll trust you
and give it a shot.

1008
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,530
And for once,

1009
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,430
I'm going to believe
in the person who believes in me.

1010
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,910
I'll get into crypto too.

1011
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,710
What?

1012
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,550
Wait, don't tell me...

1013
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,720
the train has already left.

1014
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,090
- First, just download the app.
- What?

1015
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,490
Once you create your account,

1016
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,500
I'll send you five of my coins.
No, make that ten.

1017
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,870
That's worth around 8,700 dollars.

1018
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,400
Wait, can you really give me
that much?

1019
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,570
Are you sure you don't mind?

1020
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,710
Mind? Of course not.
I call this a worthy indulgence.

1021
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,410
Eun Sang...

1022
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:57,910
Me too.

1023
00:56:58,310 --> 00:56:59,810
I'll throw in five, too.

1024
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,320
You guys...

1025
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,250
Forget 8,500 dollars.

1026
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,550
Let's make it 85,000 dollars.
No, let's go for 100,000 dollars!

1027
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,790
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

1028
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,030
Huddle up, everyone. Come on.

1029
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,330
- Here we go again.
- Let's go! To the moon!

1030
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,430
- Oh, my.
- Let's go! To the moon!

1031
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,630
- To the moon!
- Let's go! To the moon!

1032
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,540
That's how it always was.

1033
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,540
Whenever I wanted something,
the first thing I'd think was...

1034
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,180
"Do I really need that right now?"

1035
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,510
The answer was always
pretty much the same.

1036
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,550
Maybe later.

1037
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,480
Sometime down the road.

1038
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,820
The easiest thing to deny myself
was my own heart.

1039
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,490
But I decided not to do
that anymore.

1040
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,960
With these great people by my side,
I'll let myself be completely happy.

1041
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,030
After all, we're all more than
deserving of it.

1042
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,040
What is this?

1043
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,950
They sure are having a great time
in their own little bubble.

1044
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,850
No, we're not.

1045
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,630
(Marron Confectionery)

1046
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:29,940
The doors are opening.

1047
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,810
The doors are closing.

1048
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,930
Maybe it's my first day back,
but this feels a little awkward.

1049
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,630
Are you sure it's not me
that's making it awkward?

1050
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,640
- Are you sulking?
- Of course I am.

1051
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,640
- Why?
- Because you shot me down.

1052
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,310
By saying we should just be friends.

1053
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,210
- Boo.
- The doors are opening.

1054
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,900
- The doors are closing.
- Wait, hold on!

1055
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,770
Wait, this is
the executive elevator.

1056
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,440
I should be the one who's baffled,
not you.

1057
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,270
Didn't you say
you wanted to be friends?

1058
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,670
I did.

1059
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:45,110
But how is wanting to be friends
the same as rejecting you?

1060
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,180
You mean it isn't?

1061
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,620
Dr. Ham, you're...

1062
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,350
way out of my league.

1063
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,760
I get it, okay? I already got it.

1064
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,360
How many more times
must I hear that?

1065
00:59:58,860 --> 00:59:59,990
Goodness.

1066
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,400
Could you stop cutting me off?
What are you, a conversation killer?

1067
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,630
Dr. Ham...

1068
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,700
you really are
an extraordinary person.

1069
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,470
You're cool and incredibly capable.

1070
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,380
But still, I want to see
where this goes.

1071
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,480
With you, Dr. Ham.

1072
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,860
I don't mean
we should just remain friends.

1073
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,360
I'm saying we should start
as friends.

1074
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,730
Whatever challenges come our way,

1075
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,770
I say we...

1076
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,430
take it on.

1077
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,340
Even if we get shipwrecked,

1078
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:48,410
let's treat it like
an exciting adventure...

1079
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,740
and enjoy it.

1080
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,280
Together...

1081
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,090
Gosh...

1082
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,220
What?

1083
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:05,690
I'd like that.

1084
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,860
I said it's fine.
Stranded, adventure, whatever.

1085
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,960
As long as I'm with you,
Jung Da Hae.

1086
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,900
Why even ask when it's so obvious?

1087
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,270
Gosh...

1088
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:20,770
Right.

1089
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,740
By the way, how did you
get to Namhae that day?

1090
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,380
Well?

1091
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,350
- Remind me why we came to Namhae?
- For a creative retreat.

1092
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:34,990
You know how famous musicians,
when they get writer's block,

1093
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:38,390
they just take off for somewhere new
and come back with timeless hits.

1094
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,760
I guess it's not a bad approach.

1095
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,730
But we'll be back by Friday, right?

1096
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:45,000
I have to get to my part-time job.
Don't you have that important thing?

1097
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,030
With the Vietnam branch.
That signing ceremony or whatever.

1098
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,900
Yes, of course,
we'll be back by then.

1099
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,040
It's important.

1100
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,510
- Let's take a picture over there!
- I'll go ask someone.

1101
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,810
- It's so pretty!
- What?

1102
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,910
Don't just say that.
How about that over there?

1103
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,310
- That one's good, right?
- It seems okay, I guess.

1104
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:00,880
Hello. Excuse me,

1105
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,180
would you mind taking a picture
for us?

1106
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,490
You don't have to do all that.

1107
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,690
- This angle makes your legs longer.
- Thank you.

1108
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:19,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1109
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,700
Thank you.

1110
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,840
Thank you.

1111
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:25,170
- Have a safe trip.
- Selfie time!

1112
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,740
Selfie time!

1113
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,180
- You picked a great restaurant.
- I know, right?

1114
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,790
They sure know how to find a pricey,
but tasty, spot.

1115
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,460
- What else should we order?
- You guys want some shrimp?

1116
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:48,260
What?
This place is famous for abalone.

1117
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,830
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1118
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,530
Can a customer treat everyone here?

1119
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,330
- Excuse me?
- I'd like to buy...

1120
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:57,700
an order of abalone
for all the tables.

1121
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,240
He lay down flat
on the ground just to get the shot.

1122
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,380
Look at her, having fun.

1123
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,350
Excuse me?

1124
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,160
Hello.

1125
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,030
I just wanted to ask you something.

1126
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,090
Yes?

1127
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,860
Do you know of any clubs
around here?

1128
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,100
Like, a popular one
with a good crowd?

1129
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,600
There are no clubs.

1130
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,870
They're all closed.
So just go, okay? Go!

1131
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,370
- Go on.
- Why are you getting so mad?

1132
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,410
I'm not getting angry, it's just...

1133
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,440
Just go! Go!

1134
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,640
This guy's ridiculous.

1135
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,310
You're trying way too hard.

1136
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,380
Help me!

1137
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,820
Da Hae?

1138
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,750
Da Hae!

1139
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,220
You startled me.

1140
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,560
What is it?

1141
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:55,260
What are you doing?

1142
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,360
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1143
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,460
Aren't we going back to Seoul?

1144
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,000
She's obviously in danger.

1145
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,330
Are you telling me
to just leave her?

1146
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,800
Hey, what about
the signing ceremony?

1147
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,100
We'll be late even if we leave now.

1148
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,410
If you don't go back to Seoul now,
you're going to be in real trouble.

1149
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,180
It's not like
you're the owner's son.

1150
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,210
If you mess up
something this important,

1151
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,380
do you really think
you'll keep your job?

1152
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,650
- Whatever.
- What?

1153
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,680
Tell them to go ahead and fire me.

1154
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,290
Are you serious? Hey!

1155
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,960
Hey! Ham Ji Woo! Hey!

1156
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:24,960
Is he crazy or what?

1157
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,060
Hello?

1158
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,130
I'm asking how you ended up
in Namhae.

1159
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,900
I don't feel like getting into that.

1160
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,330
But let's agree on one thing.

1161
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,300
What kind of promise?

1162
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:39,000
I'm fine with starting as friends
and going slow,

1163
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,840
- but let's not hold back too much.
- Hold back on what?

1164
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,180
My feelings.

1165
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,450
From now on,

1166
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,810
don't be afraid to overdo it.

1167
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,620
Because I'm certainly
not holding back.

1168
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,220
Okay.

1169
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,140
What is this?

1170
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,140
What is it? Something interesting?

1171
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,510
I don't know about that.

1172
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,610
It's probably not...

1173
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,680
very interesting to you.

1174
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:25,480
What is it?

1175
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,950
(Hoppang Bite)

1176
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,150

(Special thanks to Yoon Kyung Ho
and Zhang Hao)

1180
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,440
Why do those people keep
whispering like that?

1181
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,180
Is it because of that?
Just say it's real.

1182
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,310
Friends? Is that a problem?

1183
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,480
Even if we're not equals at work...

1184
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:29,780
Hey, Kim Ji Song!

1185
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,850
From now on, you're paying.

1186
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,120
- What?
- I'll collect every last penny.

1187
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:36,860
It just keeps dropping.

1188
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:40,430
When crypto prices drop,
that's your signal to buy more.

1189
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,730
We're not doing this for nothing.

1190
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,530
We can't get by
on our salaries alone.

1191
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,200
- What is this?
- Da Hae, do you invest in crypto?

1192
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,500
Watch Ms. Round like a hawk.

1193
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,300
Mr. Ko is already on my case.

1194
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,410
If he finds out about this,

1195
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:54,870
I'm dead meat.
