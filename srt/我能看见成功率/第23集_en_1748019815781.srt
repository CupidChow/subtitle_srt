1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of the Earth

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Wow!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Wow! The King of the Earth

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is even better! The King of the Earth

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Wow!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
These two pieces are very fragile. At least 10 billion in price

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Wow!

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How is it?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My strategy is good, right?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Your strategy is really good

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Congratulations to the King of the Earth

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Since you are already busy

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Why do you have to be alone in the voting number 5 and 6?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Because I have not arrived at home

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I have been married

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I have not changed much in the King of the Earth

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So the two of you alone

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
must be the King of the Earth

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Mr. Tian, the leader

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please allow me

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The King of the Earth

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The King of the Earth

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Everyone, I am sorry

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I...Wu Yi, if you don't have the words

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will be the King of the Earth

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
These 8 pieces are very good

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Especially the number 8

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It is definitely the King of the Earth

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
With this King of the Earth

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
For the next 5 years

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can be the first in the world to be the King of the Earth

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You are so amazing

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Miss Mu, we are so polite

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Since then

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I should have said the invitation to the famous building

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
97%

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Xitong, you are awake

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Xitong

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Did I make a mistake just now?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Mr. Tian, what else do you want to say?

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't worry

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I will be the first

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It seems that you are still a little bit sincere

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's just that I don't want to be the first

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I didn't do it

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't know how Mr. Tian looks at the market

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But in my opinion

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All the business in the world can be cooperated

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But the higher the higher the higher the higher the price

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Miss, this time in the hundredth time

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's really amazing

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When we started the double-double-double king

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Everyone was surprised

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Look at you

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It didn't go well

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now it's double-double king

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a little sister

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, right

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I received the invitation to the famous building

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Since others know that I have been in the central health care room

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think when I go to the hospital

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I will be watched dead by the ghost

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We have to be clear in this period

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What do you mean

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You and Bai Wu

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Which step has you taken?

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If you don't want to be interested

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I will be the one to take the initiative

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No wonder you said to prevent fire and prevent the house from being closed

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I did it wrong

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You are so funny

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are so funny

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Ye Er just received the notification of the famous building

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The auction will start tomorrow night

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They are in a hurry

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's gather at the hospital tomorrow night

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And we can go out together

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And Qing Qing

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can do me a favor

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't move

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is the famous building

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The Te 77

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,080
The Seoul

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The paintings are a little bit safe

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
It's good to have thislike

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,200
Han Se analog

90
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
I have to say, they are deemed illegal

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
Then they can use this

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
It won't happen

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,500
There is a hidden camera hotel in the castleushing looking..

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
Bai Hong..

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,000
Where..

96
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,100
It's supposed to be famous housekeeper.

97
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,460
Did you see the bug video on the platform.

98
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,140
The Prince of the Mu family has been released by me.

99
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,140
As long as we prove that the other products are fake,

100
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,060
we can immediately send them to the court.

101
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,260
Next,

102
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,260
we'll wait until the police arrive and arrest the thief and bury him.

103
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,260
This plan sounds simple.

104
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,660
I just don't know if there's any accident.

105
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,460
There's an accident. It's 100% true.

106
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,860
100% an accident?

107
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,660
How many real-time products are there in the meeting?

108
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,860
100% real-time products.

109
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,260
It's indeed a fake product.

110
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,260
What's the accident?

111
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,460
The system.

112
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,660
What's wrong?

113
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,460
The system told me that 100% of the products were an accident.

114
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,260
How could it be?

115
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,660
Wait. Your system is back to normal?

116
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,060
But it's not stable.

117
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,460
You can't remember this. Just come slowly.

118
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,460
I'll think of a way to make it a bit more efficient.

119
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,860
Let it be back to normal.

120
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,660
Zhang Hao, you two...

121
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,860
No, what are you thinking?

122
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,260
Everyone, wait.

123
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,260
The underground auction of Ming Lou will begin now.

124
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,860
Now, let's enter the first part.

125
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,660
Let's welcome the eight treasures.

126
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460
Good.

127
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,460
These are all treasures kept overseas.

128
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,460
Oh, these are all fake.

129
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,460
All of them are fake.

130
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,460
The real ones should be in the Palace of the Divine Palace.

131
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Now, let's start the auction.

132
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
The first one is the fake one.

133
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,460
The fake one is the fake treasure.

134
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,060
This is the fake one.

135
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,860
The treasure is from the six countries.

136
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,660
It's made of gold.

137
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
It's very complete.

138
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,460
It's very powerful.

139
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,060
The price is 5 million.

140
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,060
The price is less than 10 million every time.

141
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,460
Let's start.

142
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,860
10 million.

143
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,260
Let's wait and see.

144
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,260
I want to make this place a heaven and earth auction.

145
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,860
10.5 million.

146
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,260
15 million.

147
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,660
15.5 million.

148
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,260
15.8 million.

149
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,460
18 million.

150
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,860
21 million.

151
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,060
21 million.

152
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,660
25 million.

153
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,860
25 million.

154
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,660
25 million is the first time.

155
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,260
25 million is the second time.

156
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,260
25 million.

157
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,860
Cheng Jia, congratulations.

158
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,260
Let's check the background of this person.

159
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,460
Sit.

160
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,060
Let's start the second auction.

161
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,660
Wait.

162
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,660
What's your command?

163
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
Since I've already taken the auction,

164
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,860
should I ask for a play?

165
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,260
There will be a process for auction.

166
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,260
If you want to play, you can go to the backstage.

167
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,460
You mean to let me go to the backstage?

168
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,260
You're really kidding.

169
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,660
Who's kidding?

170
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,660
I'm just kidding.

171
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
I've already taken 25 million.

172
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,860
I'm just kidding.

173
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Is this too much?

174
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,460
Master, this guy is a guest from the Mu family.

175
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,660
The Mu family didn't give him his real identity.

176
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,460
He's probably the player of the famous Wang clan in the imperial family.

177
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,660
This is not a rule.

178
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,860
A rule?

179
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,660
What is a rule?

180
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,060
I add 1.

181
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,660
26 million.

182
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,060
27 million.

183
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,260
27 million.

184
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,060
30 million.

185
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,660
Is that okay?

186
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,660
30 million.

187
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
25 million.

188
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
25 million for the first five days of the auction.

189
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,660
That's not all.

190
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Let him play.

191
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
Let him play.

192
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Let him play.

193
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
Let him play.

194
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
Let him play.

195
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Next, let's welcome Mr. Ximen to play.

196
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
No, the first five days of the auction.

197
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,660
Mr. Ximen wants you here so badly.

198
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,860
Who's opposition up for the dimming bells?

199
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,660
I'm going to Lady Xiu's house.

200
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,860
Lady Xiu?

201
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Please come in, 엄청, please?

202
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,660
It's dangerous.

203
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,660
Please sit.

204
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Thanks for the favor.

205
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,220
The weight is 1575 grams.

206
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,900
It's very stable.

207
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
It's very rich in quality.

208
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Rich in quality?

209
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Then, using it to cut people...

210
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Is it like playing with me?

211
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Sir, you can't joke like that.

212
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,980
You think I'm stupid?

213
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Of course, I'm joking with you.

214
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,780
How can I use the 30-year warranty?

215
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,860
Cut people?

216
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,260
You're crazy.

217
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,060
The sword is cut again.

218
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Of course, it's cut.

219
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,660
Yan Pin!
