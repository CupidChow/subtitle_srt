00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Hello, Mr Huang

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,160
Nice to meet you

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,040
Did you see it?

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,720
Then let's evaluate this

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,280
decisions

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,380
Move

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,480
Take a good look

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,020
when it comes to my job

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,140
I bet you just said

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,520
I don't think haven't you tried this before?

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,080
Yes

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,060
Done

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,740
Sister

14
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,140
That's right

15
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,440
Sister

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:27,600
drink

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,760
This is ours

18
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,360
finally

19
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
I'm guilty.

20
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,360
I'm dead.

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
Go to the treasure room

22
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,360
and exchange it for you.

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Mr. Bai Wu,

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
do you want to live a little bit?

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Live what?

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,040
This is clearly a

27
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,360
treasure meeting

28
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,360
and everyone else.

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
No.

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
It's said that you've been in the hospital for a long time.

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
But you can't see the results.

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
It's so rude.

33
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
What's wrong with this?

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
The history group is so rude.

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
It's so rude.

36
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
It's so rude.

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
It's so rude.

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
This kind of micro-diagnosis

39
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
is indeed my type.

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
What does that mean?

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
But

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,360
it's not a normal finger.

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
It's a secret

44
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
hidden inside it.

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
A big secret.

46
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,360
It's so rude.

47
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Jin Shao-lu is so smart.

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Your old man

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
knows that you're sleeping a little bit.

50
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Will he break our plan?

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Brother, I...

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
I know.

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
I didn't blame you for what happened before.

54
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Now I'll give you a choice.

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Here are 100,000 yuan.

56
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Take it to your mother's hospital

57
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
and help me do something.

58
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
What can I do?

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Based on the character of Jin You-long,

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
you will surely do it on purpose.

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Help me take some pictures

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
from the treasure room.

63
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
But

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
I don't know the password.

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Don't worry.

66
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
The password won't be able to help me.

67
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,360
I thought I could find something useful.

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
I didn't expect to hide it.

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
The fingerprint of the password

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
is worth 500,000 yuan.

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
The price is higher than 100,000 yuan.

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
What's this?

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
What's this password?

74
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
I don't know.

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
I don't know.

76
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Jin Shao-lu,

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
this thing is so terrible.

78
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
It can't be passed to his brother and his father.

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
They are dead.

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
500,000 yuan.

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
500,000 yuan.

82
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
100,000 yuan.

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
100,000 yuan.

84
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
They are two thousand yuan.

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
100,000 yuan.

86
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
It's a good thing.

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
100,000 yuan.

88
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
100,000 yuan.

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
100,000 yuan.

90
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
250,000 yuan.

91
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
250,000 yuan.

92
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
I give you 250,000 yuan.

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Thank you, Mr. Jin You-long

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
for the 250,000 yuan donated.

95
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Congratulations.

96
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
You bought a finger for 250,000 yuan.

97
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
You are so lucky.

98
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I will solve the problem of not putting the deposit on the front desk.

99
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I will put it on the bed.

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Let's thank Mr. Jin You-long again

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
for the 250,000 yuan donated.

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Mr. Jin, what should we do next?

103
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
I will give you the money.

104
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
I will give you the money for the 250,000 yuan.

105
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
I will announce it with honor.

106
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,360
The auction this time is over.

107
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
You are the prime minister.

108
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
You can be a good man.

109
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
But to me,

110
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
it's better to have a good relationship.

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,360
I will not go back.

112
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Mr. Bai,

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
how can you be so interested in Gu'an?

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
I am Guo'er.

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Then I was raised by others.

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
This is the only thing

117
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
my parents left to me.

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
He Tian Gu Yu.

119
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
So you want to use him as a clue

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
to find your parents in Guanquan.

121
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I will not go back.

122
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
I will give you the money.

123
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
What about the calculation?

124
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Where did you learn it from?

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Tian Ji is not reliable.

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Fine.

127
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,360
I don't like to listen to lies anyway.

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
If you want to talk about Gu'an,

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
remember to tell the truth.

130
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Thank you for today.

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
I will make up for you.

132
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
For example...

133
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
For example what?

134
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
For example, tea.

135
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Do you like red tea or green tea?

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
What?

137
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
You are disappointed.

138
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Or what do you think?

139
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Nothing.

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Okay, Yan Gui is right.

141
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Gu Yincheng's car.

142
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Have you heard of it?

143
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Of course.

144
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Jiang Cheng's Gu Wanjie is too old.

145
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Next, I want to ask him to be my guardian.

146
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
But I heard that

147
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
the old car is very strange.

148
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
It rarely knows how to drive.

149
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I know his granddaughter very well.

150
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Maybe we can meet her.

151
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Very well?

152
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
How much?

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Because of some reasons,

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
we are living together for a while.

155
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Mr. Fan is really good.

156
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Being able to be with the granddaughter of the old car

157
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
is already a responsibility of the whole Gu Yincheng.

158
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
The old car?

159
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
No, we are just friends.

160
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Director Tang,

161
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
there is a problem.

162
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
The collaboration between Wanbao and the younger brother

163
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
may be a mess.

164
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
What's going on?

165
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Someone deliberately messed up the auction.

166
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm in a black-out.

167
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,360
The auction of the next month is also in the city.

168
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I'll be late to bring you a chance to replace you.

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Please don't mention the old car.

170
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I'll prepare a gift for you.

171
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
A bonus in the future.

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
I need to find a new place to rent a car.

173
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Look, we are here.

174
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Brother Long.

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Xiao Xiao.

176
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Why are you here?

177
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm here to look for a house.

178
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Where are you?

179
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm working here.

180
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm here to play with him.

181
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Mr. Fan,

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
this is the four-bedroom room you want.

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
The total price is 4.86 million.

184
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Please take a look.

185
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Satisfied.

186
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
White and big.

187
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Bright.

188
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Leave it to me.

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Mr. Fan,

190
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
if you are satisfied,

191
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,360
we should sign the contract.

192
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Xiao Xiao, don't worry.

193
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Here.

194
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
If I sign the contract,

195
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
you will raise your hand.

196
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
I treat you so well.

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Shouldn't I

198
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
show you my skills?

199
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Mr. Fan,

200
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
I'll treat you to dinner.

201
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
You are with me.

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
I'll treat you to dinner.

203
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Okay?

204
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Okay.

205
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Mr. Fan,

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Mr. Fan, I don't need it.

207
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Xiaolai Mei,

208
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
I have many friends.

209
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
I'll introduce them to you.

210
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
How about it?

211
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Xiao Xiao,

212
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
this is a good example.

213
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Xiao Xiao.

214
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
You have many friends.

215
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
They came to buy a house.

216
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Or to play with Miss Dao?

217
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
This sentence.

218
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
There are threats and tricks.

219
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
One word, two words.

220
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
You are so mean.

221
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
So it's like this.

222
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
You learned it.

223
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
But it's so disgusting.

224
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
This is so disgusting.

225
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
What are you doing?

226
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
What are you doing?

227
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
You are so mean.

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Look at the price of a little girl.

229
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
So disgusting.

230
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
You are so mean.

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
You are so beautiful.

232
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Beautiful is

233
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
to buy a chain.

234
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
The private office just now,

235
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I want it.

236
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Okay.

237
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
You are so mean.

238
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
You are so mean.

239
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
You are so mean.

240
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
You are so mean.

241
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
You are so mean.

242
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Why do you buy 4 million houses?

243
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Who gives you the face?

244
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Who gives you the face?

245
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
The 16th floor of the sixth floor.

246
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Now.

247
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Okay.

248
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Xiao Xiao is so mean.

249
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
You pretend.

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
You are so mean.

251
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Just do it.

252
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Don't throw away your face

253
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
just for a woman.

254
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Why are you so nervous?

255
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
You can buy it first.

256
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Why me?

257
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
I can't afford it.

258
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
I can't afford it.

259
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
So you buy it.

260
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Mom, look.

261
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
It's too small.

262
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
I don't like it.

263
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
With the fish and goose,

264
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,960
The fish and goose price is

265
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,120
2037.8 yuan.

266
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,680
I said you can't afford it.

267
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,760
Are you okay?

268
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,520
How do you know it's your head?

269
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I'll count it.

270
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,080
You'll know it's real

271
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
when you see his expression.

272
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,360
Wait!

273
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,920
Wait a minute, Uncle.

274
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,360
Who are you?

275
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,120
Mr. Li.

276
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Thank you for listening to me.

277
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,640
This is my wife, Si Ting.

278
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,280
Hello, I'm Bai Wu.

279
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
I came here to buy a house today.

280
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,320
Isn't it good to live in my house?

281
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,280
Are you in the same neighborhood?

282
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
No.

283
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,120
Look.

284
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,280
You misunderstood again, right?

285
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,120
Yes.

286
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,280
Anyway, it's...

287
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,640
It's a warning.

288
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,880
The chef is dead.

289
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
He's not dead.

290
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,840
The warning is that

291
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,840
the death rate of the chef is 99% higher.

292
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,000
The chef will take action immediately.

293
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
The death rate of the chef...

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
Is this my confession?

295
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,560
It's related to the death rate of the chef.

296
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,720
It's 0%.

297
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,120
Is it a brain disease

298
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,000
or a brain disease?

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,120
It's 0% of the death rate of the chef.

300
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,160
Why is it...

301
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
It's natural to be killed.

302
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,160
It's 0% of the death rate of the victim.

303
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,240
Bai Wu.

304
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,040
Why are you so cruel?

305
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,600
Are you not feeling well?

306
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm fine.

307
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,640
Sorry.

308
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,920
I'll go and take a breath.

309
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,640
It's neither a grudge

310
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,600
nor a brain disease or a natural death.

311
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,280
Is it a human's body?

312
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,480
It's 100% human body.

313
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,280
The death rate of the chef is 62% lower.

314
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,520
It's related to the death rate of the chef.

315
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,320
It's 100% human body.

316
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,280
It's 100% human body.

317
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,320
It's safer to be outside.

318
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,240
Is it...

319
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,400
someone is trying to blow up the kitchen?

320
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,680
Someone is only trying to blow up the kitchen.

321
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,400
It's 100% human body.

322
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
It's 100% human body.

323
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
