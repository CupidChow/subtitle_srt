1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hurry up!

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Hurry up!

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
It's all my fault.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,000
I found out that he's been in bad condition recently.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
I didn't keep it to myself.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, he's been rescued.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,000
Besides, he can't be tired of you.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Right.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Si Ting!

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Xiao Lang!

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Why did you do that?

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,000
You can't solve anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Are you worried about me?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Xiao Xiao Xiao, you've helped me too much.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I didn't have time to look for you.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What exactly happened?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I...

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
I borrowed a small loan.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
But I only borrowed 4,800 yuan.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For five months,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,500
Li Guoli wanted to pay 200,000 yuan.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I couldn't pay it at all.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,500
200,000?

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Because Gao Zhongbi...

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,500
I was so proud of my power.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
That day,

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,000
I met someone when I was waiting for my classmate.

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Miss Xiao,

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
you should know about it.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
We're all from Jiangcheng Capital.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
The teacher of the training department

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
is also a teacher of the important universities.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Help me fill this up.

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Just two minutes.

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Please.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I was just looking at him

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and he was just like me.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I wanted to help him make a deal

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and also help him improve his career.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But he finally announced it.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was so heartbroken.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The tuition fee is 6,000?

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't have that much money.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We have a cooperation with a loan company.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you loan someone,

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you can still beat our tuition fee.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you think we need to pay for it?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not afraid to ask you the truth.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're all from the university.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're all under pressure.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We can only pay for the tuition fee.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
After that,

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
he told me the whole thing.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I signed the contract.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Didn't you just sell a room for my brother?

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My brother is married.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't afford a room at home.

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
My mom has been crying all this time.

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I just gave her the money.

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
But you...

62
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
What happened after that?

63
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Hello?

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Hello?

65
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Is that the money loss help?

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
I want to think about it.

67
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
I borrowed 4,800 yuan.

68
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
How come I only have 2,800 yuan?

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Hello?

70
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Our loan company needs to pay for the tuition fee.

71
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
We need to pay for the tuition fee.

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
We need to pay for the tuition fee.

73
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
We need to pay for the tuition fee.

74
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
The average is 40% of the loan.

75
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
That's too high.

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm not seeing you.

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Your loan has been issued.

78
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
But you didn't give me the money.

79
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
You gave me the training.

80
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
The loan contract is signed by you.

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Yes.

82
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
But...

83
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Our loan company only knows the person who signed the contract.

84
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
What happened?

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
I found out that they were just a couple.

86
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,500
At first, I thought that I was only being cheated by 4,800 yuan.

87
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I had 2,000 yuan in the end of the month.

88
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
I could pay back the money.

89
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
But last month, my brother got married.

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
My mom took all my money to pay me.

91
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
I found a good job in the city.

92
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
I went out again.

93
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
And I got my red envelope.

94
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
I got 2,000 yuan.

95
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Thank you, my dear.

96
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,500
I thought that I could pay back the interest of the 3,800 yuan.

97
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
But I didn't expect...

98
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
No.

99
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
How can I?

100
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I only paid 10,000 yuan.

101
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I spent 800 yuan a month.

102
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
How can I get 8,500 yuan from 4,800?

103
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,500
The interest of 3,300 is paid by the 2,400 gold.

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
We will pay the interest of the 7th.

105
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
No.

106
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
You are too fat.

107
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I can't pay back the interest.

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Don't worry.

109
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
We are doing it according to the rules.

110
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
You must pay back the interest.

111
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I will recommend you the area.

112
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
This is the high place.

113
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
You can go there first.

114
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Pay back the interest of the high place.

115
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
What?

116
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
From that time on,

117
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I will pay another loan on a software loan.

118
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I will pay the next one.

119
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Even if I only have 2,000 yuan a day,

120
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I still don't have enough money.

121
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I have more and more money.

122
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I am really scared.

123
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I killed all the software I brought back.

124
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I also took the black one from the store.

125
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I thought I could take it.

126
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Don't pay back the interest of the far place.

127
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Don't pay back the interest of the money.

128
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
That's the money I have.

129
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Look at what you did.

130
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
You are so weak.

131
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Look at her.

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Did you borrow so much money?

133
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:24,380
She must have gone to the

134
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,380
store to pay the interest.

135
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
I only borrowed 4,800 yuan.

136
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,380
You asked me to pay back the interest.

137
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,380
How could I have so much money?

138
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
The time is coming.

139
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,380
Or we can only use other ways to withdraw the interest.

140
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,380
No.

141
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,380
I...

142
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,380
I...

143
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,380
The child is not stubborn.

144
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,380
He has thick skin.

145
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,380
He is not thick.

146
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,380
He has so much money.

147
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Don't you pay back the interest?

148
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,380
Look.

149
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,380
My god.

150
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,380
I can't believe it.

151
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,380
Hello, mom.

152
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,380
How could you do such a shameless thing?

153
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,380
You can't sell the money.

154
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,380
Mom.

155
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
What did you say?

156
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,380
You have lost our face.

157
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,380
We are a family.

158
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,380
How could you do such a shameless thing?

159
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Let her die.

160
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,380
Don't come back.

161
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
I...

162
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
It's not me.

163
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,380
I didn't do this.

164
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
It's not me.

165
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,380
I said I didn't do this.

166
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,380
I said it's not me.

167
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,380
The End

168
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,380
Damn it.

169
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,380
They are so bad.

170
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,380
Hurry and report it.

171
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,380
We have to let them be punished.

172
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
It's useless.

173
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,380
We don't have any evidence.

174
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,380
They must have prepared it.

175
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
I...

176
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Is that so?

177
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,380
I don't dare to believe it.

178
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
But now,

179
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,260
I have to investigate the

180
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,380
Shen Gong Hall.

181
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
What?

182
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
Could it be that they are the fund

183
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,380
of the Shen Gong Hall?

184
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,380
The fund is 48%.

185
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,380
So it is.

186
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,380
Wei Yan.

187
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,380
Do you have any idea?

188
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
It's fine.

189
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,380
Let's find the evidence first.

190
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
I want to join you.

191
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,380
I admit that you were right.

192
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,380
I will immediately call the court to

193
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,380
make a decision on the case.

194
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
That's good.

195
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,380
But you don't have to join.

196
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
After all, it's dangerous.

197
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,380
It's not dangerous.

198
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,380
There are half of the funds.

199
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,380
Miss Li.

200
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,380
I'm still here.

201
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
Okay.

202
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
Okay.

203
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,380
Let's investigate the case.

204
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,380
I admit it.

205
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,380
It's hard to believe.

206
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,380
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,380
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,380

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,380
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,380
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,380
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,380
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,380
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,380
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,380
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,380
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,380
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,380
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,380
I'm sorry.

223
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,380
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,380
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,380
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,380
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,380
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,380
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,380
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,380
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,380
I'm sorry.
