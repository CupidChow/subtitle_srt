1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
To be continued...

2
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,580
I feel so great.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,800
I should prepare the match.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,540
Or I'll be ruined.

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,340
Why?

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,940
Who asking?

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,660
You guys don't need me to read it.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,720
No!

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,380
Your d징!

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,940
My wind...

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,320
Would you pay me back?

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,280
Are two pieces my fault?

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,060
I'll fullfill your Dionys.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,700
It's too slippery.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,520
Who cares about the kero today?

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,240
You bastard.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,000
Enough.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,840
I'll compensate you.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Half of the money.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,080
That's enough.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,480
Half of the money.

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,920
The case is solved.

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,320
How much is the money?

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,760
600,000 yuan.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,200
The debt is solved.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,000
12% is the debt.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,600
Xiaoxiao,

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,680
I have some accidents.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,800
I didn't hear anything.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,680
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,120
I didn't hear anything.

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
What happened?

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,920
I need a new assistant.

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,640
New assistant?

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Bai Youge,

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,760
do you want to live here?

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,120
Don't move.

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,240
Don't come over.

50
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,400
Lift your legs.

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
It's clean.

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,080
Don't move. Don't touch it.

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
I need to wash here.

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,360
No.

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,680
Why is it so cold?

56
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,920
It's noon.

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm going to the water.

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,120
I want you to help me wash here.

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,280
I need to be gentle.

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,080
You can't hide from me.

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
Bai Youge,

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
I'm going to shower.

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
た hideout please.

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,280
All right,

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,200
let's go.

66
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,920
Thank you, Bai Youge.

67
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Oh, yeah.

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,120
No way.

69
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,920
ский xie desperately wants me and the Grandmaster

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,320
I need to help with way result

71
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
so I asked Bayou to help me

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,840
You helped me too much.

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,280
You are the first person in the Taidou Jiangcheng Sword-guarding of Gu'er Street.

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,880
Gu Yunkeng is back.

75
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,800
Yes.

76
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Do you know my grandpa?

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,120
Who doesn't know the car in Gu'er Street?

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,520
Then please call me brother Bai Wu.

79
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
Good boy.

80
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,480
Disinally.

Ji就會.

84
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,920
Wen Lan

85
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,140
Ride me

86
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,340
You can't break me

87
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,960
Why do you lie down for me?

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,900
Lin Yao

89
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,660
ained

90
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,080
Jiang Huhu

91

Lin He

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,480
AJ

93
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,560
We are a fly

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,640
You're stuck

95
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,140
Let go

96
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,080
خDO

97
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
I'm so angry.

98
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,720
I'm not that weird.

99
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,680
How's the shooting?

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,880
This is the first public scene in our family.

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
We have to catch the scene.

102
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
Xuan De Lu.

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,040
Nice to meet you.

104
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,480
I'm Gao Yun.

105
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
This is the 15,000-yen show.

106
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,560
30,000.

107
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,480
30,000.

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,640
You calculated this?

109
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
Yes.

110
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,920
Bai Wu.

111
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,240
Do you know why I want to invite you

112
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,760
to the auction of Wan Bao Chamber of Commerce?

113
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,080
Why?

114
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,440
We plan to go back to China.

115
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,680
We need partners in Jiang Cheng Luo's place.

116
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,120
I think of working with Wan Bao Chamber of Commerce.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,720
I want to calculate the secret of the cooperation.

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
Okay.

119
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,640
You don't have a plan now, do you?

120
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
I do.

121
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
But I'm afraid you won't believe me.

122
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,200
I'll give you the evidence

123
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,240
for the operation.

124
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,960
You've done it.

125
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,440
Yes.

126
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,760
Okay.

127
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,200
Yes.

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,200
Okay.

129
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,720
Ji Shao, I...

130
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,400
Don't worry.

131
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Your son doesn't have any other partners.

132
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,960
We have a plan to get you.

133
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,280
Don't be so formal.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,840
Dixing Qing is not a normal woman.

135
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,880
We're not going to do it this time.

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,520
Yes.

137
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,600
I heard that the auction of Wan Bao Chamber of Commerce

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
invited a new witness

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
to help our Dixing Qing.

140
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,920
Dixing is not only a rich country,

141
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,720
but also a global relationship.

142
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Dixing Qing is a woman.

143
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,720
But she controls the whole Dixing.

144
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,560
The rumor that the Dixing is single.

145
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,960
It seems that

146
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,360
Ji Shao is going to be in a relationship with the Dixing.

147
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,400
Thank you for your words.

148
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm going to get the double-edged sword

149
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
for the beauty of the world.

150
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,080
Get ready.

151
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,560
Bai Wu,

152
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,960
this place

153
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,320
is not where you can enter.

154
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,000
What are you doing?

155
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,280
You're putting the dog in front of you.

156
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,040
I can't enter.

157
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,440
This is Wan Bao's charity auction.

158
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,120
This thing

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,040
is called the invitation.

160
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Invitation, right?

161
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,080
This thing.

162
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,160
This...

163
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,920
This...

164
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,640
I know.

165
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,120
You just want to eat and drink.

166
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,200
Xiao Ye,

167
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,520
I remember

168
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,480
we gave the guests a place

169
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,720
to stay.

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
We asked Bai Wu to find a stool

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,360
and let him sit there.

172
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,520
This time,

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,560
you have to eat and drink well.

174
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,760
Because of such a big scene,

175
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
you never saw it.

176
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,440
What are you arguing about?

177
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,400
Wang Xie,

178
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
I've never said that

179
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,680
there will be a big person coming today.

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,280
It's my good thing that I'm ruined.

181
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,200
I'll kill you.

182
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,360
Ji Shao, it's Bai Wu.

183
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,800
This is a poor thing that can't even earn

184
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,840
three thousand yuan.

185
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,160
He wants to enter our charity auction.

186
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,200
Mr. Wang,

187
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
you're wrong.

188
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,200
Yes.

189
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,720
These low-level people

190
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,800
are also very poor.

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,880
They are poor people.

192
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,440
Yes.

193
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,760
Don't give them the face of death.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,480
Just a little pitiful

195
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,280
self-sufficiency.

196
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,120
Resilience.

197
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,680
Have you finished?

198
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,040
Go in.

199
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,360
If I didn't wait for Miss D,

200
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I would kill you.

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
I...

202
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,240
Bao An.

203
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,840
Bao An.

204
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,800
Fuck.

205
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,160
Miss Qingqing,

206
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
it's been a long time since you last met me.

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,120
Okay.

208
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,680
Let's go.

209
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,600
Miss Qingqing,

210
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,040
she's just a little bit confused.

211
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I'll drive her away.

212
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,360
Get out of here.

213
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,040
How dare you!

214
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,440
How dare you treat me like this?

215
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,560
Miss Qingqing,

216
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,800
the guest of Miss Qingqing

217
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,520
is so rude.

218
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,160
I'm sorry.

219
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm sorry.

222
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,160
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,720
I'm sorry.

224
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,680
I'm sorry.

226
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm sorry.

227
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,880
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,120
Gui Ke is...

229
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Bai.

230
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,560
I'm sorry.

231
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,280
Mr. Bai?

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Gui Ke.

233
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,880
Is this the guest of your Wanbao Chamber of Commerce?

234
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,640
Or do you not like our Di Group?

235
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,400
You bastard!

236
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,720
Miss Di's Gui Ke dares to take the lead.

237
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,840
How dare you!

238
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,160
Miss, are you saying...

239
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,720
Say it!

240
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,240
I...

241
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,920
I...

242
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,720
Say it.

243
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,480
It's all my fault.

244
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,160
Miss Qingqing,

245
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,320
don't be angry.

246
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,480
It's all my fault.

247
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,760
You don't have to apologize to me.

248
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,760
Yes.

249
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,200
Mr. Bai,

250
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
you're not a petty person.

251
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,360
It's all my fault.

252
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,080
Don't show me your true colors.

253
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,840
So,

254
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,360
I can go in?

255
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Of course.

256
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,280
Go and see her.

257
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,560
Miss Qingqing.

258
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Who are you?

259
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
I don't know.

260
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,760
I didn't see you before.

261
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
I'm Miss Di.

262
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,240
Don't talk nonsense.

263
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Welcome to the Wanbao Chamber of Commerce.

264
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,040
The first one is the first one.

265
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,240
Let's practice first.

266
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
This is the painting

267
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
of the young artist Wang Fu.

268
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
It's a mountain.

269
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,720
It's worth 50,000 yuan.

270
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,200
It's not less than 10,000 yuan every time.

271
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,640
I'm 60,000 yuan.

272
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
80,000 yuan.

273
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,640
100,000 yuan.

274
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,800
200,000 yuan.

275
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
I don't know how to say it.

276
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm afraid that the clothes

277
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,760
will be confused.

278
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

279
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,520
Our lowest price is...

280
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,200
1,000,000 yuan.

281
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
I'm 2,000,000 yuan.

282
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,400
It's only 2,000,000 yuan.

283
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,440
What's going on?

284
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,760
What's going on?

285
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,640
Deal.

286
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,760
Thank you, Miss Di Qingqing

287
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
and Mr. Bai Wu

288
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
for bringing a good end

289
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
to this charity auction.

290
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,240
Next,

291
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
please welcome Miss Di Qingqing

292
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
or Mr. Bai Wu to the stage.

293
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Please come up.

294
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Thank you, everyone.

295
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,240
Thank you, Miss Di Qingqing

296
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,840
for letting me speak to her.

297
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,320
The auction of the Wanbao Chamber of Commerce

298
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,720
was very good this time.

299
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,360
But I hope that

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,320
the Wanbao Chamber of Commerce

301
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
will be more professional

302
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
in the preservation of the ancient play.

303
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,560
That's right.

304
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,360
What does that mean?

305
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
What does that mean?

306
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,560
You're the one who asked me

307
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
to take care of the business.

308
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
That's right.

309
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
Mr. Bai,

310
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,640
how can you say that?

311
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,840
First,

312
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,520
there's a chance on the scroll

313
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,680
that it means that there's no proper cleaning.

314
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,840
Second,

315
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,240
the sword is open.

316
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,280
It has no old and old

317
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,840
or old-fashioned smell.

318
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,320
It's not yet been re-built.

319
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,560
It's a thousand-year-old.

320
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
Finally,

321
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,320
the spring mountain painting is too popular.

322
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,840
It's been on the scroll for a few days.

323
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,760
It's likely to become a spring painting.

324
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,720
What a shame.

325
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,440
It's so embarrassing.

326
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,320
Miss Di Qingqing

327
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,360
donated 2 million yuan to the charity auction

328
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
and saved a treasure.

329
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,760
It's all the money from the scroll.

330
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Thank you.

331
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Thank you.

332
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
Thank you points forotti dt.

333
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
Thanks Mr. Bai.

334
00:12:44,000 --> 00:13:02,580
Next

335
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,680
Mr. Bai.

336
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,120
Q9 is the mostulates strongest

337
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Now thedel產撰品池

338
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,160

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,220
Wei cutie

Who is burn?

341
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,160
Who is everyone these years?

342
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,600
The price is the kind of kindness in the heart

343
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,480
Lost my most precious treasure

344
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,520
The light is out of the way, it is on the wall of the mirror

345
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,240
The golden hands of the golden horse and the golden horse are in disguise

346
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,280
The fate wants me to break through the secret room of the big blue window

347
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,560
The treasure of the rich and the poor

348
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,360
The center of the world and the world

349
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,200
I compete for every victory

350
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,240
The망loss is the rainbow

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,880
The young man who dies possess even if he faces 1 or 2

352
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,920
This size

354
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,920
