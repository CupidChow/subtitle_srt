1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Ready a love story

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,040
The following drama will be episodes 8

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,000
Li

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,460
Li

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,900
Dong

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,020
Good

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,640
You done a good thing

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,160
번째

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,040
die

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,220
dumb

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,500
됐

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,820
Let me hit you

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:27,960
You have to get it

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,860
Don't move

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't be so excited.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,600
If he can't find the evidence,

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,000
it means he's fake.

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,200
I'll give you an explanation.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
But if he finds the evidence,

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,400
it means he's fake.

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,800
Boss Zhang,

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,400
I'll have a good talk with you.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,800
The old man is not a good man.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
It seems that we can only win today.

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,200
It's said that 95% of the winning face is already very big.

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
This is 13 billion.

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,800
What if it's a second cup?

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,400
Xiao Fei,

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,400
the profit has been broken.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,800
It's 13 billion.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,600
Is it fun?

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,000
Is there a saying?

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,800
Yes.

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
The evidence.

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Take out the evidence.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
Of course there is evidence.

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,600
It's a fake.

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,000
The system is broken.

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,400
The coin was found to break the probability of 98%.

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Will my lower part of the coin be broken?

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,600
The probability of breaking the probability is 58%.

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
It's so dangerous.

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,000
I almost lost my lower part of the coin.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,400
So...

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
The probability of breaking the probability is 8%.

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,400
Fine.

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,000
It's not a big deal.

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Fine.

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
The coin is broken.

50
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
The price of the coin is low.

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Come out quickly.

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
It's been a long time.

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
The car is not happy.

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Mr. Chen,

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
the steel is broken.

56
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Look at your face.

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
Give him a chance to find the evidence.

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,600
Look at him.

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
He is so anxious.

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
He has been doing evidence for a long time.

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
What's the hurry?

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,600
It's just a big deal.

63
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
We have to find it for a while.

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Come out quickly.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm really close to 13 billion.

66
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
That's a little girl.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,600
It's over.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,400
It's over.

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm so worried.

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
Did it break?

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,600
How is it, Xiao?

72
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Mr. Bai,

73
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
13 billion is a big treasure.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,400
You...

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are impulsive.

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,400
Kid,

77
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
I can't get the evidence.

78
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
I want your life.

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,200
Where is it?

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,200
Where is it?

81
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,000
If it doesn't come out,

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
the car can't be delivered.

83
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,000
Come out.

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Come out quickly.

85
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I found it.

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
Everyone, please look.

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
What is this?

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
A horse.

89
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,400
Mr. Zhang,

90
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
can you explain it to me?

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm so scared.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,200
Look.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
Mr. Zhang,

94
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
you don't want to say it.

95
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I don't want to say it.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,400
You don't want to say it.

97
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
These two horses

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,800
are the big officials.

99
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
You want to put it in, right?

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Right?

101
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm so worried about you.

102
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Mr. Zhang,

103
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
you have to give me a statement.

104
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,800
Go.

105
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Captain Xiao,

106
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,400
how did you know

107
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
that Mimi was in the steel?

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Yes.

109
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,400
Mr. Che,

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
did I tell you?

111
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
I've given up.

112
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,200
Forget it.

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
You dare to say it.

114
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,400
I've given up.

115
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Hurry up.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
You said you want me to help you.

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Three small things.

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,200
The first thing is

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
I want you to take back

120
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,400
the three money.

121
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Xiaoxiao and I

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,200
are just friends.

123
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
And I've solved the problem.

124
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
What about the second thing?

125
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
The first group

126
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,600
didn't know if you and Uncle Xiao had heard of it.

127
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
I think it's

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
the Gu An Society in the sea.

129
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
They want to go back to China.

130
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,800
Yes.

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
They want to

132
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
be their first customer.

133
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,800
Stop it.

134
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,600
I'll deal with it.

135
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
What about the last thing?

137
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
The last thing.

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
I want to hire a car.

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
I don't know if this is a prison.

140
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Have you seen it?

141
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
Where did you get this?

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm the Gu An.

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
This is the only house

144
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
my parents left to me.

145
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
I heard from Xiaoxiao

146
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
that you have the same one.

147
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,400
I want to ask

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,000
if you know

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
the clue of my parents.

150
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
I know

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,800
some things about this.

152
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,400
Please teach me.

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you really want to know,

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,800
then you can help me find out.

155
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Okay.

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Hello?

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,000
What?

158
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
Jiulong Gang was killed?

159
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Who did it?

160
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,800
It's a guy named Bai Wu.

161
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Bai Wu?

162
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,800
And he found the evidence of the crime.

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Wang Bada

164
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,400
is a good man.

165
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
He was a traitor

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
the night before.

167
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
If anything happens,

168
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,400
Mr. Tang will be guilty.

169
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
We can't take it.

170
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,200
Dad,

171
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
what do you mean?

172
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Hello?

173
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,800
Call a cab for me.

174
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
What are sick?

175
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,400
Hold the candlestick on my arm.

176
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,800
How old are you?

177
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
Mi Maruいくか?

178
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,400
Why did you open your mouth?

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
You are such a bot.

180
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Heße.

181
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,800
Heso.

182
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Please tell me,

183
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,240
I love you,

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
but you can't be his guest.

185
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,200
You know,

186
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
it's just that

187
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
Hello?

188
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,040
Don't come here. I'm not your type.

189
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,200
Who are you?

190
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,400
Don't理 them.

191
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,040
It has nothing to do with you.

192
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,160
You're the only one who hates me.

193
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,920
Fatty Wang, what's wrong with them?

194
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,600
I'm the dream man of Jing Qian Zhuang.
