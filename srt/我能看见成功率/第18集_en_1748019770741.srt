1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Little brother, don't be anxious.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's have some love, okay?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Okay.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,000
Handmade

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,160
Good!

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,280
Wow, mate,

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,820
like you drank a lot!

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,880
Wow.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,960
Matacions that I have to listen to...

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,600
I love the way you drink,

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Good man, good sexiness.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
I like it.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
You are...

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
You are...

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Brother, you are really strong.

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
You like this kind of feeling?

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
I will come.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Can't you see?

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Come again.

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
You...

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Brother, you are so lucky.

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
I have seen you before.

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
You are the strongest man.

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Brother, you are really strong.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I am even stronger.

27
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
So blood.

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I have to add more next time.

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
What's wrong?

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
It's late.

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Dangerous machine.

32
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Don't move.

33
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Who are you?

34
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
We are the nurses.

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Yes, we are just here to find the bathroom.

37
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
But we are lost.

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Nonsense.

39
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
There are so many bathrooms.

40
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I think you two are not good.

41
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Brother, why do you know everything?

42
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Don't laugh.

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
If Mr. Pang knows,

44
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
you two will be thrown into the sea.

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
He will kill you.

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Brother, don't tell your friends.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
How about we play together?

48
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Play?

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
This...

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
is not suitable.

51
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Suitable?

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Why not suitable?

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Hurry up.

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
We can't go.

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
We can't go.

56
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
I think we are here.

57
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
These are their criminal evidence.

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Wu Yanyan.

59
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
How can we take them out?

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
This is a secret.

61
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm not taking you.

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Before the rescue is done, we'll stay here.

63
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
One side to protect ourselves, the other side to protect the materials.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Okay, keep the door open.

65
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Chi Chao, hurry up.

66
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
The most important thing in this place is the security guard.

67
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Bai Wu, look at these.

68
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Wan Bao Chamber of Commerce.

69
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Wan Bao is the most important person in the

70
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
business.

71
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
The evidence is in our hands.

72
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
You can't hide for long.

73
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Smile.

74
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
A outstanding capable man is only a man.

75
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
He knows the system.

76
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
A capable man?

77
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Where did you get the contract from?

78
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
My parents left it to me.

79
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
And what did you mean by outstanding capable man?

80
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
It seems that you are just a mischievous, mischievous,

81
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
and capable man.

82
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
A real man.

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Go to heaven and meet your parents.

84
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Farewell, Bai Wu.

85
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Police, police.

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
A major danger in life.

87
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Wu Yan, what's wrong with you?

88
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Don't panic.

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Xitou, the password.

90
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
The password doesn't exist.

91
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
The amount of money is 0%.

92
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
The information is self-reliance.

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
The countdown starts.

94
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
10, Wu Yan.

95
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
How dare you!

96
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Xitou, don't you have the defense function?

97
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I...

98
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I have to cover three people.

99
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Is the amount of money needed to know the speed of the operation

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
the choice to know?

101
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
To know.

102
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
One.

103
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Goodbye, brother.

104
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Xitou.

105
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Xitou.

106
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Xitou, are you still here?

107
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
All the evidence on the boat was destroyed.

108
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Mr. Meng was missing.

109
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
The witnesses you provided were found at the hotel.

110
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
We will continue to investigate this case.

111
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Thank you for your cooperation.

112
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
It's my pleasure.

113
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Thank you.

114
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
The defense function covers three people.

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
The amount of money needed to know the speed of the operation

116
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
the choice to know...

117
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
To know.

118
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
It's a ship.

119
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Good job.

120
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I...

121
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I...

122
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I...

123
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Hurry and wipe it.

125
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Why are you so stubborn?

126
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Why are you so stubborn?

127
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Wu.

128
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Come to see me tomorrow.

129
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
It's good that you are self-reliant.

130
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Do you have any clues?

131
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Yes.

132
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
We found the information about the security and security of the previous meeting

133
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
at the Sky Island.

134
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
So we are...

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
The security and security of the meeting

136
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
should be the fund for the construction of the artificial intelligence.

137
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
The information?

138
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
From the information,

139
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
the artificial intelligence should be prepared

140
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
for the JRA overseas auction in New York next month.

141
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
As far as I know,

142
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
there are many famous netizens

143
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
who lost their lives in the auction.

144
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Yes.

145
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
The God Palace is going to buy national treasures from the JRA auction.

146
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
It will be a big sum of money.

147
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
For this,

148
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
they will definitely sell the goods

149
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
at Wanbao's auction.

150
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Why are you so careless?

151
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Wu.

152
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
You are so unlucky recently.

153
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Why don't you give yourself a calculation?

154
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Are you having a bad time recently?

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Forget it.

156
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I have to be unlucky.

157
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
But now,

158
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
the time is

159
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
to seize the chance to

160
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
return to the God Palace.

161
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
You have to remember that.

162
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
It's easy.

163
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
In the auction,

164
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
you can seize a dirty goods.

165
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
As long as you find the goods at the scene,

166
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Wanbao will not be able to take it away.

167
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm here.

168
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Jin Shao,

169
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
don't come here without permission.

170
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm here.

171
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm here.
