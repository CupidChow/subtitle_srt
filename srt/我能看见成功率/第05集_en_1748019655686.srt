Episode 1

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,360
Let's go.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,520
Come back with me to see your parents.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,200
Wait. This is not appropriate.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,400
I just went there. Your parents may not accept it.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,920
When that time comes,

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,520
we'll be in front of them.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,760
If we do this,

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,200
they'll believe us even if we don't believe them.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,160
This situation is so sudden.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,880
How can I feel like I'm playing the fairy tale?

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,160
0%.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,280
Is that the truth that you want to take me to see her parents?

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,800
100%.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,960
Is that the truth that I want to be her boyfriend?

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,560
0%.

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,840
You asked me to go

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
to get your parents to get married?

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
20%.

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,360
20%?

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,360
Yes.

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
Pretend that...

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,280
Let's go.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,880
Where are you from?

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,280
What do you do?

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,760
How long have you known Hong Jiang Yi?

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Mom.

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,560
You guys talk slowly.

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,760
I'll go get some water.

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,360
Let go of me.

31
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,920
I'll knock on the door today.

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,800
I'll close the door.

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,560
warmth

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
Qianqian hates finder 3 hours.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,840
I'll tinker with her the moment

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,600
I find out the person she hates the most.

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,120
After I prove she is an ass.

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm sure she'll get used to being a liar.

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:02:16,820
moral

40
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,560
You don't value yourself as a kein�로p escape?

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,500
As long as you help this for me

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,320
I can do it

43
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,060
Look at your true face, Zhang Nan

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,980
What?

45
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,680
Am I sleeping in the galaxy además?

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
Xidao, the rate I'm going to get right now is...

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,160
100%

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,080
Then...

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
Is it a lie?

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
100%

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,600
So it is...

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,640
Well, I have something else to do.

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll go first.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
Wait a minute.

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,320
You still want to test me?

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,040
So huge

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
How cool

58
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,600
If I say it directly,

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400
don't you trust me on purpose?

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Go to hell!

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Miss Mu, I'm sorry.

62
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
I really helped you.

63
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
I really helped you.

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Miss, I have something to do.

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
I'm leaving.

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Lan is here.

69
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
She's eating.

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
No, no.

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm the only one who's sick.

72
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I'll go to the nurse.

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm leaving.

74
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Where are you going?

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
You're so annoying.

76
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Just pretend that you're not.

77
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
You're so annoying.

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
You want to be so gentle.

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
You should have seen your face earlier.

80
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
It's more important to make money.

81
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
We'll have a auction in two days.

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
We should run a auction.

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Let's go to Wang Pongzi again.

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Mr. Pang,

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm really lucky this time.

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
How about this?

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Let's ask my friend

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
to buy a house here.

89
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
No.

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Qi Tao,

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
how much does Wang Pongzi's price

92
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
cost?

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Five thousand.

94
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Five thousand?

95
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
One hundred percent.

96
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Three thousand?

97
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
One hundred percent.

98
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Wow, that's a lot.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Three thousand.

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
I'll buy one house.

101
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Three thousand is one house.

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
One house.

103
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
I have a house on the floor.

104
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
I can't afford to spend two thousand and eight thousand.

105
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
I'll sell three thousand.

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Ten times the price.

107
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Of course, I don't want to sell.

108
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
You're also a Tong Daoist.

109
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
You pick one.

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
One.

111
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Okay.

112
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,320
What's the use of this little donkey?

113
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
It's him.

114
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Okay.

115
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
It's so dangerous.

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
I've got to get in the house.

117
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
It's dangerous.

118
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
It's dangerous.

119
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
I know it.

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
I'll get in there.

121
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
I'm really not familiar with him.

122
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
You just take him away.

123
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
I'll get in with him.

124
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
It's dangerous.

125
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Don't run.

126
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Don't run.

127
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Don't run.

128
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
You're going to kill him.

129
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Don't run.

130
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Don't run.

131
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
You're going to kill him.

132
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
You go.

133
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
You go.

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Don't run.

135
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
You go.

136
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Don't run.

137
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Don't run.

138
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Don't move!

139
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Don't move!

140
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Don't move!

141
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Xie Tou, which way should we go?

142
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
This way.

143
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Hurry!

144
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Hurry!

145
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Go to the left!

146
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Go to the left!

147
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Go!

148
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
I'm here!

149
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm here!

150
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Hurry!

151
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
I'll kill you!

152
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
You two, go!

153
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Bai Wu, did you say you'd come here?

154
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
How could it be possible?

155
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
How do you know where I'm going?

156
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
I can count on you, my lord.

157
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm sure you're right.

158
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
This way!

159
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Hurry!

160
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
I'm done for.

161
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
You're a fool.

162
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
I'll see where you're going.

163
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
I...

164
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,320
My lord, you haven't even been saved.

165
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
He's here!

166
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Xie Tou, this way!

167
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
You're killing me again?

168
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
You're killing me again?

169
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Wan You!

170
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Wan You!

171
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
You're a fool!

172
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Wan You, I'm sorry for today.

173
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Let's talk about it later.

174
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm not afraid of you.

175
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

176
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,320
The escape success rate is 51%.

177
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I'm going to kill you!

178
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm going to kill you!

179
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Fatty, I'm sorry.

180
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
It's okay.

181
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm done for.

182
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm a little bit caught.

183
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
It's okay.

184
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm done for.

185
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Stop it.

186
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Stop it.

187
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm not done yet.

188
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
I'm not going to hide anymore.

189
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Look at the strength of Fatty.

190
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Brother, how much money do you want?

191
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
I'll send my wife over to you.

192
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
