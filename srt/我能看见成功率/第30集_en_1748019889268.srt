00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The total progress is 96%.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's hurry and call the police!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If it's you,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then many things are said to be painful.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For example, when the old man was investigating the God Palace,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
why was he always suspended?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For example, when we entered the famous building and got the missing books,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
why did Wan Bao get the news so early?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He asked the God Palace to gather all the information in advance

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and let Jin You Long escape.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
For example, why tonight, you!

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You must go to the national treasure!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I've already reported the police. The police will be here soon.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All the tracks in the building have been blocked.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then the car can't run.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If these things weren't in front of me,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I wouldn't have believed the president of the ancient school.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How dare you!

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You are the spy of the God Palace!

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The power switch mode is on.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Great!

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Master He!

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Master He!

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hehe!

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Only the Constantï¿½timophobia,

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
can it be that you can't threaten me?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The God Palace has been blocked?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Who knew that I would guess your intro dutch?

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You killed my parents?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How so?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I want to kill you.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Blood war and bloodbath!

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I...

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No!

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't come over!

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Stop fighting.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll help you get rid of her.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Xitou, are you done with your upgrade?

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The upgrade is 98%.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll find a way to get out of this world.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll ask you a few questions.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I didn't get her.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm in a hurry.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll exchange the secret of the Ghost Manor.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ghost Manor?

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What secret?

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The upgrade is 99%.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why do you have to release the two-digit number of the Yan Pin in the Palace of God?

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If you don't,

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
won't it be the same as the real one?

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Bastard!

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
When all Yan Pin are real,

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
there's no real one in the world.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then the stock market will be over.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How did you get it?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Enough!

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No!

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Tell me the secret of the Ghost Manor immediately.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you want me to come,

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll kill you right now!

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The upgrade is 99%.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The third-digit number of the Yan Pin is out.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No!

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No!

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you okay?

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm fine.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm fine.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
An Wu.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you think I'm as stupid as Ximeng?

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How many times have I told you?

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
38, 37, 36.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're delaying the time!

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm still here.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How many times have I told you?

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Go.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
20, 24, 23.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
15, 14, 13, 12.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
An Wu!

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Two.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
One.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The system upgrade is complete.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The detection is dangerous.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The power of the power is activated.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The power of the power is activated.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The power of the power is activated.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I want to hug.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's over.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let me hug.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll give you the nuclear fuel.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You've got the nuclear fuel.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You can use it to destroy the world.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sorry.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not interested in the world.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Wait a minute.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You don't understand how strong the power of the nuclear fuel is.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It can turn the time into a dead body.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For example, your double-edged sword.

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The detection of the speed star is off.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The power of the power is activated.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why do you need to enter the city?

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I knew it.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The dead person will be worried.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The system.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The system.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now there is no system.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The system is destroyed.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No system.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The system.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Now the system is gone.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're hurt, aren't you?

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Damn it!

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're dead!

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No!

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Run!

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hagi!

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Fatty!

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Fatty!

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Be careful!

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wei Yan,

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you can't kill him.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm dying.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Fatty!

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No!

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Fatty!

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Fatty!

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Fatty!

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Fatty!

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Fatty,

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
remember this.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
From now on,

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
don't think about the future.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In the end,

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
you'll hurt the closest person.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm the one who killed him.

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm so worried about him.

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The night Wang Fatty died,

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the national treasure was confiscated.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The human kingdom was destroyed.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But the system disappeared that night.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Fortunately, I didn't suspect that I was an ordinary person.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was my girlfriend.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I started helping the car owner

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to take care of the car.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Of course, I didn't suspect that.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm the boss of the half-life hall now.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm tired of watching TV every day.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You say that

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you're a little bit more than a little bit of a party.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You've been in the half-life hall for a year.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why do you always stay here?

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why are you in a hurry?

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's just open.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When the mother comes,

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
will the half-life hall be listed?

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It will.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can only play the game.

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Brother Bai Wu.

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I believe you.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, my god.

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Who got this store?

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The half-life hall.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's too hard to listen to.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes, it is.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But it's very special.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're right.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes, it's very special.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're the boss here?

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The meeting is over.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Come in and have a look.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, my god.

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is a good thing.

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This price

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
is a good deal.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Boss.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
How much is this?

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Boss, how much is this?

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
10,000 yuan.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Mr. Fang.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It seems that his first customer,

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
the bird,

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
will be listed for him.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
10,000 yuan.

187
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
10,000 yuan.

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
10,000 yuan.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is too expensive.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
