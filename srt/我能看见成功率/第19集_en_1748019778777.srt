1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Damn it!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Who dares to do this?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You bastard.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You want to die?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How dare you ruin my factory?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Jin Shao, what a great crisis!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is my father's account.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is my father's account.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is my father's account.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know if I can see it or not.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't know if the auction of Wanbao is in place.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Or if Sun Mourong is in it.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Uncle, what's your plan?

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The auction will be held on that day.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Jin Yonglong will definitely be out of the blue.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's okay.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm normal with you.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I don't dare to borrow his 10-minute file.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't dare.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
President Sun, as you said,

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't invite your friends to come.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Since that's the case,

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
then these kids,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
please allow me to explain.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who dares to do this to you?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We didn't know you lost your life.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,160
vraiment

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
After that,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is Wanwuyi lost his lot?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's about it.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But based on the original plot.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I still have a far awaylean gun.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Fat has auctioned that day,

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you go to Wanbao Market

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,120
This is a bit difficult.

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,840
This Wanbao Chamber of Commerce is not...

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,480
Maybe I should investigate this.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,720
Don't worry.

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,800
I will give her a person who can't refuse.

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,560
Comrade Jin A, I want to report a case.

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,200
I am a former employee of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,160
I report Wanbao Chamber of Commerce to the public.

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,760
Stop!

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,280
You can't enter here!

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,640
Comrade Jin A!

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,720
Director Wang, I'm leaving.

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,560
No...

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,080
This...

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,120
Comrade Jin A!

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
No.

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,200
I know Wanbao Chamber of Commerce has a problem.

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,120
I want to report it.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,600
I want to leave!

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,320
Wu Yan, I have everything here.

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,800
Handle it.

57
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,680
Then...

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,640
I will report it to the public.

59
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,120
The workers are prepared.

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,200
The enemy is divided into three.

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,640
You little brat, you have a hand.

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,880
Please pass it.

63
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,080
Everyone, the next product.

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,680
The budget of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong years.

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,520
The price of the flag is 4 million.

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,000
The price of each family is less than 200,000.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Please come in and take the price of the next film.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200

69
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600

8 million.

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:11,960
You are...

75
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,280
The first time 8 million.

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,320
8 million.

77
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,760
Second time.

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,080
The third time 8 million.

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,160
8 million.

80
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,400
Chen Jiang.

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
Congratulations to Mr. Bai.

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
You got this rare product.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,840
Mr. Bai, please come to the movie theater.

84
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,880
Wait a minute.

85
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,520
Let's take a look.

86
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,480
Then let's take a picture together.

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
It's too crazy.

88
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,160
What do you mean by taking a picture?

89
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
He is planning to take a picture with the company.

90
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
You are so arrogant.

91
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,240
The next film.

92
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,320
The budget of the Han Dynasty's Emperor is 5.5 million.

93
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,440
The price of the flag is 5.5 million.

94
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,640

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,480
6 million.

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,920
6.2 million.

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,000
1 million.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,760
The price of the flag is 6.5 million.

99
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,960
1.3 million.

100
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,040
How do you know?

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you want to take it?

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,480
I don't take it.

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,400
1.3 million.

104
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,360
The second time.

105
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,080
1 million. Chen Jiang.

106
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,320
Congratulations to Mr. Bai.

107
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,280
You got this rare product.

108
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
The double-closed silver plate.

109
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,800
The starting price is 5 million.

110
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,360
Every time...

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,760
2 million.

112
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,440
I got this rare product.

113
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
I don't want to take it.

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,600
Let's take so many pictures today.

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,320
While the ticket is not available,

116
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,520
the price of the combine這些

117
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,120
is 5.7 million.

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,360
Mr. Bai has a lot of skills.

119
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:36,200
Soft food, HEY that looks delicious,

120
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,880
Americans,

121
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,440
the碳 visual is great.

122
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,480
Training察不打算

123
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,720
world university I don't僕食

124
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,840
It's impossible.

125
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,080
If it's a fake,

126
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
wouldn't the signature of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce be broken?

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,480
I don't think so.

128
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,640
Bai Wu, don't make a fool of yourself.

129
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,360
The signature of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce

130
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,040
is a thousand-picture selection.

131
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,480
It's a family-finding selection.

132
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,880
It's impossible to have a fake.

133
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,160
President Sun,

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,760
please tell us the justice.

135
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,200
Yes.

136
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,080
Let President Sun decide.

137
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
President Sun, what does this mean?

138
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,120
What's going on?

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,840
These products

140
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,760
are indeed not strong

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
with Sun's eyes.

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,200
But there are indeed some products

143
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,560
in the market now

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,880
that are fake.

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
But I'm not sure

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
that these are real products.

147
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,400
Fake products?

148
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,520
What are you kidding?

149
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,760
There are really some products like this.

150
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,440
How can we play alone in the future?

151
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
Yes.

152
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,120
Did you hear that?

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,000
The current product

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,840
is the Royal Gu's Royal House.

155
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,960
Bai Wu,

156
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,040
since you said that these are real products,

157
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,640
you're taking the evidence?

158
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
It's very simple.

159
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,120
It fell.

160
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,360
It was shot with a double shot.

161
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
It fell when it was shot with a double shot.

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
The evidence you want

163
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,840
is hidden here.

164
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,120
I'll get it for you now.

165
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,320
Bai Wu,

166
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,560
where's the evidence?

167
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,320
Take it out.

168
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,880
What's wrong?

169
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,120
I don't see it.

170
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
The energy is insufficient.

171
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
We need to know the speed.

172
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,920
Why are you so careless?

173
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,840
It's impossible.

174
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Is it possible?

175
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,760
If you buy a antique,

176
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,280
you'll hear a voice.

177
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
I can't lose

178
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,200
the money in the Royal House.

179
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Mr. Wang,

180
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
we've checked all the products.

181
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,400
There's no problem at all.

182
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Where's the fat guy?

183
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,760
Fat guy?

184
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,800
The Royal Master cheated him.

185
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,640
There's no problem

186
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,800
with the contract and the property.

187
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
What's the information in the right plate?

188
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,000
It's all normal money.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's just that some people

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,400
took a copy of the evidence.

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,200
Some people think there's a problem.

192
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,400
Didn't you say that

193
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,800
you want to report it?

194
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Yes, I did.

195
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,600
I'm a worker.

196
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm a customer.

197
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
I've been working here for ten years.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,600
I've never paid a penny.

199
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,400
Bai Wu,

200
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
did you make a mistake?

201
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
It's impossible.

202
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
It's impossible.

203
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,600
It's all normal.

204
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,000
It's all normal.

205
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
It's all normal.

206
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,200
It's all normal.

207
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
What does it mean?

208
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,000
It's all normal.

209
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
Bai Wu,

210
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
you spend money on your own stuff.

211
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
I don't care.

212
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
But don't frame a good person.

213
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
The Golden Zhe Fa.

214
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
It's the product of Golden Zhe Fa.

215
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
What are you doing?

216
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
Say it again.

217
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,400
Golden Zhe Fa, the president of Wanbao Group.

218
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,000
He's from the Shen Gong Hall.

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
Catch him.

220
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
If you make him know,

221
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
you'll catch him, right?

222
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll take you to catch him.

223
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
What's wrong?

224
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
What's wrong?

225
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
What's wrong?

226
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
Don't touch my hair!

227
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Catch him!

228
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
What's wrong?

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
Golden Zhe Fa, you're dead.

230
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,200
