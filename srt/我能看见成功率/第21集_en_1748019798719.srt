00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What's this?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This jade represents my faith in you.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Don't let me down.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Mr. Cheng, you're too noble.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I've been studying the river and soil for many years.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now I see that you're his friend.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's go.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Great.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Maybe I can use a new jade.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Jade?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Give me some reaction jade.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
As long as it's not a bad thing.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Study it carefully.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll be back.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hello?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Miss Di?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hello, Mr. Bai Wu.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm Mr. Di's secretary.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Can you tell me what happened?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll answer it.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then tell her how I did it before.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So you were able to calculate the jade

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
because of the jade seal?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now you can't calculate it.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's because the seal is still falling.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's right.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now you're very good at it.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's also because the seal is transparent.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I said that because you were afraid of the system.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And not because you were afraid of the jade seal.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Then what are you afraid of?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm...

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm afraid of the jade seal

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that we have to investigate.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then tell me.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Aren't you afraid of the jade seal?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're not.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Although you're a little bit clever

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and a little bit naughty.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But you have a kind heart.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And you have your own color.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you really praising me?

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I believe you.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I just want to believe you.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're a confession.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I...

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I want to confess

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that you can promise me.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well...

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well...

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a pity that my system is falling.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't calculate it.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I should suspect anyone.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't calculate it.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I got a clue.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you want to know?

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Tell me.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The famous building.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The famous building of the Mu family.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The famous building for the auction.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No way.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The famous building is a illegal antique auction.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The auction is not clear.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The business of the Mu family is legal.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yi'er.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Xingqin.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I told you.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is not an old thing.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why do you keep it?

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And you.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're so stubborn

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and you're not as good as you were.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're so bad.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't blame him.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's all my idea.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Look.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're already bad.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yi'er.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The famous building is likely to be the last fund chain of the Shengong Hall.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you're my best friend,

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
only you can help me.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Even if I promise you,

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you won't invite me to join.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
As far as I know,

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
as long as there's a prince,

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
you can get the invitation to the famous building.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Prince?

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Next week.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Next week is the Prince's bidding meeting.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The Mu family should be there.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The Prince's bidding meeting is five years.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But the Mu family

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
never gets the bid.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You've been blowing the bull's eye.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you tired?

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you can help the Prince

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
to get the bid,

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll help you to join the famous building auction.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No problem.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No problem?

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The system is on the line.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't worry.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How can a living person be so smart?

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm still talking nonsense.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How about this?

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's go together.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We must avoid the internal crisis.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Keep it secret.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Keep it and keep it for me.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've done the heart surgery.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going to pretend to be a doctor.

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm in the public health care room.

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If anyone comes,

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
you can't let them visit.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
See you.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll see you at the next auction.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll be back.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Bye.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Bye.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Bye.

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Bye.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Bye.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Bye.

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Bye.

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Bye.

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,160
The third round is the most expensive one.

137
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,880
The last one is the highest price.

138
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,400
That's the one with the highest price.

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,440
The one with the highest price.

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
How can it be the highest price?

141
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,160
Zhou Huixi.

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,040
Who?

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,760
The competitor of the six-star competition.

144
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,600
Jiang Cheng, Yushishang, Tianjia, Shaodongjia.

145
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,920
The one next to him is Wei Changqing.

146
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,120
He's the most popular one in the Yushish world.

147
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,680
He's called Shen Fan.

148
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,620
Like wind,

149
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,720
you know the opponents.

150
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,560
I guess now you are Zhou Huixi.

151
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,520
Mr. debut?

152
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
It's really important

153
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,360
that he defers himself.

154
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,160
They are still on the side.

155
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
Please respect your speech.

156
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
You should respect me.

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,200
Why didn't you respect me when you were calling me a client?

158
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,840
What do you mean by calling me?

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,680
You did business by yourself.

160
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,920
They came to me on their own.

161
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
Fine.

162
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,920
You are right anyway.

163
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,600
You are happy to work with you.

164
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,680
How can we be so perfect now?

165
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,000
And this?

166
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,960
How about I join you?

167
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,200
What do you think?

168
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,920
This idea is good.

169
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,480
If you want to join me, you can join me.

170
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,640
I can understand how hard it is to be a boy.

171
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,960
It's good to be a boy.

172
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Who are you?

173
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,200
What nonsense are you talking about? Who is watching?

174
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,240
You can't watch a boy.

175
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,920
We don't know.

176
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,840
I'm sorry.

177
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
I didn't say anything.

178
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
No.

179
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,640
You can't do it.

180
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,920
You have never had a wife.

181
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,280
You have problems with your inner self.

182
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,400
Yes.

183
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't talk nonsense. I don't watch boy.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,760
Yes.

185
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,680
They didn't watch boy.

186
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
They didn't have a bodyguard.

187
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,880
Shut up.

188
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
Shut up.

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,720
Shut up.

190
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,280
Shut up.

191
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,840
I'll shut up.

192
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,920
You can't do it.

193
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,880
You are so good at acting.

194
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,480
I didn't expect that.

195
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,160
Don't believe him.

196
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Don't talk nonsense.

197
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,880
If you two are related, others will know.

198
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,800
Yes.

199
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,680
They don't know.

200
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,880
They...

201
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,560
I said it again.

202
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,760
Don't talk nonsense.

203
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,600
They didn't have a bodyguard.

204
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,520
You brat.

205
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,960
Who are you?

206
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,200
This is a black dance.

207
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,240
It's a sword dance I invited.

208
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,880
Sword dance?

209
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,160
Mu Yi.

210
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,320
Can't you and Mu Jia do it?

211
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,120
Please come to see me.

212
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
Come.

213
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,800

Do you dare to bet with me?

You bet on our future lives.

223
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,360
If you lose, you will withdraw all the competition.

224
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,560
If you dare to do it, you will be fired.

225
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,360
That's a deal.

226
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,440
Come on.

227
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,560
Come on.

228
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,040
Here.

229
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,360
It's a letter.

230
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,320
