Episode 1

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Miss, is this a dog?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you for catching me.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He just broke his dog's hand.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's okay. Let's think about it first.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He took your medicine.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, no, don't...

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No, let's think about it first.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm Xiao Xiao.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you so much.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Or you'll lose it.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm Bai Wu.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're welcome.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Bai Wu, how can I thank you?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You don't need to thank me.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can see your dog later.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I can use my power to collect the poison.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm done.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The system can be upgraded.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is it?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Of course.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In the end...

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is it a magic?

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's not a magic.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's take a look.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's take a look.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's take a look.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's take a look.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's take a look.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's take a look.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's go to...

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Fatty Yan's room first.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Boss Fat,

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the probability of the same cloud and cloud transaction is 7%.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Looks like he's still in a bad mood

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
about what I've been doing.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Wait a minute.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Xitou.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You've changed your mind.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The current version

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
can give you a certain score

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
for the problem.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What's wrong with you?

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why are you so generous?

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Money is not enough.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're right.

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Boss Fat.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How's the business?

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why are you here again?

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's the boss's business.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's useless.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid I'll go back.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You really don't want to do business.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Little boy.

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't do business.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Didn't you think I'd get you into an accident?

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sorry.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Last time, I was blind.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're not a big deal.

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Li,

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you're doing business like this.

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're not afraid of the cloud.

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Shut up.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on.

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Look.

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How much are the real-time rates of these two?

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
2%

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
26%

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a pity.

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Fatty Yan's real-time rate is much higher.

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The value of the name-to-death-mark

73
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
is 2.5 to 30,000 yuan.

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How much is this?

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
5,000.

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Today's price is 0%

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
in the public interest rate.

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What do you mean?

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There's no way out today.

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
3,000.

81
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Deal.

82
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Isn't this a deal?

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
5,000.

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I want it.

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
5,000.

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not a good deal.

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a deal.

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a chance.

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're so stupid.

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're crying.

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You offended me.

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You offended my friend.

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You don't want to live in Jiangzhou.

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Get out of here.

95
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You didn't expect that, did you?

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm close to Jin Shao.

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I knew you were his friend.

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I wouldn't let you go that easily.

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're so rich that you don't know it.

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What do you want?

101
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're blocking my way.

102
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Of course, I'm blocking your way.

103
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So they're following me.

104
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Boss,

105
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
8,000.

106
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
10,000.

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're so stupid.

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're so stubborn.

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You want to rob me, right?

110
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Cut the crap.

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do you want it?

112
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The most common one is 30,000.

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
30,000.

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Jin Shao.

115
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Jiajia.

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

117
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
5,000.

118
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
5,000.

119
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Mo Rong.

120
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're so stupid.

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You give up?

122
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Boss, your face is burnt.

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're blind.

124
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What's the problem?

125
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is a fortune teller.

126
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
20,000.

127
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
40,000.

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
30,000.

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
60,000.

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
60,000.

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
100,000.

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're fighting with me.

133
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're so stupid.

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Everyone.

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Everyone.

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Look.

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is not a fool.

138
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's a poor ghost.

139
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Isn't this a business card?

140
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're going to be a real man.

141
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're so stupid.

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're so stupid.

143
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're right.

144
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm not a real man.

145
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm a fool.

146
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What do you mean?

147
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Zishahu

148
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
has the most value of 30,000.

149
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The Yuqi and Qingci and Xiaoxiaiping

150
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
have the most value of 60,000.

151
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You've lost more than 60,000.

152
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not the one.

153
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Be careful.

154
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll kill you.

155
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're the one who's going to lose.

156
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't fool me.

157
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So much money.

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Are you angry?

159
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't be cheap.

160
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
16,000.

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
For a poor ghost,

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
it's a natural number.

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
For me,

164
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it's 33 years old.

165
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Everyone.

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Everyone.

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's going on?

168
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Remember this face.

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
150.

170
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
150.

171
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm the one who's going to lose.

172
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm going to let him go to the dog's house

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to cut the dog's head.

174
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I thought the rain could be over.

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll go with you today.

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I like to cut the dog's head.

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Here you are.

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
1000.

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Sorry.

180
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I forgot.

181
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How can you have 1000 yuan?

182
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He's given me a few years of money.

183
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm loyal.

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm obedient.

185
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm a big man.

186
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll sell you 250.

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm not a man.

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm the one who's going to lose.

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not a man.

190
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm not a man.

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm going to let him go to the dog's house.

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not going to let him go to the dog's house.

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Brother Bai Wu.

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Brother Bai Wu, why are you here?

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Come on.

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I won't disturb you.

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Take your time.

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
These are all bags.

199
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
These are bags.

200
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Bag.

201
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sir.

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He wants...

203
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
To be followed.

204
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you, boss.

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Thank you.

206
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
These things.

207
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll take them all.

208
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I understand.

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He wants to use the amount of money

210
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to buy the things he really wants.

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Look.

212
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I want to pack them.

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I want them.

214
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Two times the price.

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Qi Xiu.

216
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You want to increase the price of the Gu Anjie market

217
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
to the price of the Gu Anjie market?

218
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The rich's pain.

219
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You won't understand.

220
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm so sorry.

221
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I understand.

222
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I understand.

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I understand.

224
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I understand.

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Qin Shuang.

226
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's take a look at the price first.

227
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I understand.

228
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Your wealth.

229
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sure of it.

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Come on.

231
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you, boss.

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you.

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you.

234
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you, boss.

235
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Thank you for your help.

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Thank you.

237
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Thanks for your help.

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you.

239
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you.

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm in trouble.

241
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Help me.

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You go there later.

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Tell the boss here.

244
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm a good cook.

245
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can only help you

246
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to save your life.

247
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you, boss.

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's just over 200,000 yuan.

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a lot.

250
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm coming.

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
These things.

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You can just do it.

253
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not worth it.

254
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't worry.

255
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Boss.

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thank you.

257
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you.

258
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Thank you.

259
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you.

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Qin Shuang.

261
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let him go.

262
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What are you doing?

263
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Prepare some blanks.

264
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
100,000 yuan for the loan.

265
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll kill you.

266
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's give him a little more.

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I've already put his loan

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
in the top row of the case.

269
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Now he owes me 100,000 yuan.

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I've already lost a lot of money.

271
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I've lost millions.

272
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The so-called rich man is dead.

273
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He's dead.

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's dead.

275
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can give him a lot of money.

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can give him a lot of money.

278
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm telling you, Mo Yan.

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Your parents have agreed to add money with me.

280
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You'll be my wife sooner or later.

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm warning you.

282
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No one is allowed to marry.

283
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Mo Yan.

284
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why are you here?

285
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Are you angry at me?

286
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mo Yan.

287
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't do this.

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't.

289
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't.

290
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't.

291
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't.

292
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't.

293
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't.

294
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't.

295
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You.

296
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You.

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't.

298
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wait for me.

299
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Go.

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What are you doing?

301
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Qingqing has been

302
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
cheated by this cheat.

303
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
She's so smart.

304
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
She said she can do anything.

305
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But she doesn't have a good thing.

306
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Today, I'm going to take Qingqing out of your trap.

307
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss Mo.

308
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Big sister.

309
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You saw it too.

310
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Our relationship is special.

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We're just close.

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes.

313
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We're close to each other.

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So she has to leave with me.

315
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll leave with you.

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We're close to each other.

317
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Big brother.

318
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You promised to eat with me.

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
She has to leave with me.

320
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Leave with me.

321
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Leave with me.

322
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Wait.

323
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Leave with me.

324
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Leave with me.

325
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Leave with me.

326
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Leave with me.

327
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Leave with me.

328
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Leave with me.

329
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Director, don't break it.

330
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Leave with me.

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm going to break it.

332
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't break it.

333
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Her dog ran away.

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Aoliu.

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Big brother.

336
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Wait for me here.

337
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can't leave with her.

338
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Go.

339
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Aoliu.

340
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Aoliu.

341
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Miss Mo.

342
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You...

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Master Bai.

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Help me one more time today.

345
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What?

346
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Be my boyfriend.

347
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
One, two, three.

348
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Brother.
