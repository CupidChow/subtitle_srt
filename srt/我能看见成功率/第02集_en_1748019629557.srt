1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,200
Boss

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,500
I'm lucky to have a day

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,200
18,880,000 in total

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,300
Take it

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,300
No

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,400
It's impossible for me to live 160 days in one day

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,200
What's the situation?

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,300
There must be a problem

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Hurry up

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,700
I want you to hold the guitar

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,300
Oh, no

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,200
If the system is late, it will be troublesome

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
But I'm sure I'm lucky

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,000
Can he believe it?

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,200
I don't know what the boss said

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm a sour-dough

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
How much is the credit?

19
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm a sour-dough master in the company

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,400
It's finally up

21
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,900
Boss

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,600
Actually, I'm a sour-dough master

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
My family's reputation

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,800
It's been more than 2000 years

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm a strict scientist

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,500
I don't believe you

27
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,100
Boss, you really called me

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,800
Boss

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,400
Boss

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,400
Manager Ma

31
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,600
What?

32
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,200
Tomorrow

33
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,900
The most debt will be 180,000 in the future

34
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
It seems that the boss said that the debt will be wasted

35
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,200
It's just a debt fee

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,500
Yes

37
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,000
Then I'll sign the contract today

38
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,600
Boss

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Boss

40
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,100
You can't sign the contract

41
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,100
Otherwise, there will be a loss of money

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,100
What do you mean?

43
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,600
I mean you have to pay less than 1000

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,900
You know it

45
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm the master of the fortune

46
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,900
You're alive

47
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,900
I'll call the police

48
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,500
Boss

49
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,900
Let's bet

50
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,300
If I lose the bet

51
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,100
The money I used for the lottery was all yours

52
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,900
What are you doing?

53
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,000
I can help you

54
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,300
How much money do you need to pay?

55
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,100
Okay

56
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,900
I don't know if this 200 million is enough

57
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,100
You can count it

58
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,900
Okay

59
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,700
I'll help you

60
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,500
How much is the success rate of the other party?

61
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
3 million

62
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,100
4 million

63
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,100
My god

64
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,600
5 million

65
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,900
4.5 million

66
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,900
Boss

67
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,700
You have two options now

68
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,300
The other party will accept the 4 million

69
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,500
The other party will accept the 4.5 million

70
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,400
The other party will accept the 90%

71
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,300
Boss, can you do it?

72
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,700
You call the police now

73
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,700
Okay

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,300
Fang Xiao Liang

75
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,900
Master

76
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
You're a legend

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,300
4.2 million

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
They agree

79
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Congratulations, boss

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
More than 2.2 million

81
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,600
Okay

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll give you 30,000 yuan

83
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Are you satisfied?

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
This is not good

85
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,800
Yes, yes, yes

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
You're the master

87
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,400
The rest you want is the merit

88
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,200
You can't have money

89
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,800
Yes, yes, yes

90
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you, master

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll get you some water

92
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,400
Sit down

93
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,700
The system power collection

94
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,300
System power

95
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,300
The system power collection is over

96
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,300
The system memory function is open

97
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,700
The account is 18,880 yuan

98
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,300
Great

99
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
I'll have a life of a happy person

100
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
As long as you can use the system in a reasonable way

101
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,500
You can definitely go to the peak of your life

102
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,700
What is the ten thousand ten thousand ten thousand?

103
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
System

104
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,900
How much is the next round of the lottery number?

105
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,700
The number is too big

106
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
The power is insufficient

107
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,300
Power is insufficient

108
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,100
Master

109
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,900
The rest you want is the merit

110
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,700
You can't have money

111
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,300
The system power collection

112
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,900
System

113
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,500
I have to do something good

114
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,300
To be grateful for the power

115
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,900
Right?

116
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,300
Fifty percent

117
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,900
Don't you have to report it?

118
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,100
One hundred percent

119
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,900
This system is quite positive

120
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,600
It seems that you have to do more good things in the future

121
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
But now

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
You have to solve the ten thousand ten thousand first

123
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
It's not good to rely on the wealth

124
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
It's really too bad

125
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Look at my system

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
The number of years in this class is very small

127
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Five

128
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Five

129
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Yes

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I can have a system power collection

131
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,300
This is the most important thing in the whole program

132
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
This system is very important

133
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,300
I think it's not easy to solve the problem

134
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
So many things

135
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
People usually look at the eyes of flowers

136
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,300
But for me who have a system

137
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Not in the picture

138
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,300
System

139
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,300
Show me all the real-life probability of seeing the tiger

140
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
System

141
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,300
System

142
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
System

143
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Too strong

144
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,300
My system is too strong

145
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
Let's go and see

146
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Let's see the treasure of the house

147
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Look

148
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Big brother

149
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
Take a look

150
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Boss

151
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
How much is this painting

152
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,300
Who told you to touch it

153
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Can you afford to draw it?

154
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,300
You want to have a meal

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you know

156
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Go go go

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Is it worth more than ten thousand?

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Little Huah

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Come to my place to see

160
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
All the things are precious

161
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lao Wang

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You really don't skip class

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Fat man here

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Just look

165
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
The Hang family

166
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
The first eye is chosen

167
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
My young man from the Qing Dynasty

168
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Xiao Ye Zi Tan Fu Chuan

169
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
He said that Gao Mu's family is wrong

170
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Bao Jiang Mu

171
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
He is taking me as a vegetable bird

172
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Boss

173
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
How much is this

174
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
One thousand

175
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Fat man

176
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Are you free

177
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Look at him

178
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
He is so poor

179
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Don't say take one thousand

180
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
I dare to bet

181
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Can't even take one dollar

182
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Just you draw it

183
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Xitong

184
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
He has something more than 100,000

185
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
100%

186
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
I think it's a modern craft

187
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
100%

188
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Is it the previous one

189
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
100%

190
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
I understand

191
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Boss

192
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
This thing is good

193
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
It's too expensive

194
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
It's like buying money

195
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Brother

196
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
The so-called red sour juice

197
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Gold silk man

198
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Only play gold star Xiao Ye Tan

199
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Look at this

200
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
This is a little gold star

201
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
That's the most expensive

202
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
One thousand is very cheap

203
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
OK

204
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
But you have to give me a small price

205
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
What price

206
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
This is a raw food

207
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Take this

208
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
This is a good tea bag

209
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
This is a little expensive

210
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
What's wrong

211
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Wait a minute

212
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
This

213
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Since the raw food is raw

214
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Come

215
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Let's exchange friends

216
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Come

217
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Okay

218
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Give me a friend

219
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Give me a friend

220
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I'm tired

221
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Thank you, boss

222
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Handsome

223
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
This vase costs five thousand

224
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm not interested

225
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Come back and take a look

226
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Let's go

227
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Lao Li

228
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
You say what we do

229
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
The sword treasure can't be used

230
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
But you have to be able to see people

231
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
This is a good gift

232
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Can't keep

233
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
A handmade bracelet

234
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
And a fake headband

235
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
It's not worth a hundred dollars

236
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
It's just 100 times

237
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
It's a hundred times

238
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Say it

239
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I'll eat it well

240
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Good night, good night

241
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Good night

242
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Good night, good night

243
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Good night

244
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
35,000

245
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
What's wrong with this

246
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
A famous pearl

247
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Little fire

248
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Help me

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I'll pay 100,000

250
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Good thing

251
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Is this beautiful

252
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Gold tea

253
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
This is 100,000

254
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
This is a famous pearl

255
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
The famous pearl of the world

256
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Isn't that a two-colored stone pearl

257
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Professor Fu

258
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
You've been a good man

259
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
I'll pay 50,000

260
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
50,000

261
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
This thing is mine

262
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
I know it

263
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
I can't sell it to you

264
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
But you know this bracelet is old

265
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Don't you also sell me this vegetable bird

266
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Yes

267
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
You eat tiger's meat

268
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,600
But this should be cost-effective

269
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
We don't disturb it

270
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
You really win

271
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,740
Actually, you lose

272
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
