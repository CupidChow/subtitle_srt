1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason why I chose to escape is because I was afraid of losing.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But if I can see the success,

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can turn my life upside down.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Only one person can turn the life upside down.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's Fifth Brother.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Fifth Brother is the highest.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mr. Wang, as a newcomer, I tried my best.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, don't play with it.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's not the result.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The person who turns the life upside down is our Shao Dongjia of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shao Dongjia?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was here to sell the goods, but I was too busy.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because of you, I was so busy.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Do you know why you are here today?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I just want you to know that your efforts are worth nothing in front of me.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Mr. Jin, this Bai Wu has brought 100,000 yuan to the underground currency before the fall.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There is a contract for this loan.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If the money is removed during the training period,

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you will pay all the loans immediately.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Bai Wu, you are fired.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Qi Yonglong!

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's go!

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Fifth Brother, why did you come here?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are so stupid.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Stupid?

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You are stupid because you are my sister.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Come on, Xiao Yan.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mr. Jin, I...

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Xiao Yan!

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You want to be a chef?

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Fifth Brother, we are still in a hurry.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We are waiting for me to go back to treat him.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Xiao Yan.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fifth Brother, I am sorry.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, it's time.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I just want to give you some benefits.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Just like that...

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
...coward, that kind of meat.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You should learn from Xiao Hui too.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How can you escape from me?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are so heavy. You are so hard to kill.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you don't kill me, I will regret it.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You are so stupid.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Bai Wu!

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Lin Lin, why did you come here?

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Qi Yonglong, don't touch him!

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Bai Wu, let's break up.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't want to keep you in trouble.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't want to buy a car or a house.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want to pay for the rent and be a slave forever.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Did you see my new bag?

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
28,000 yuan.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want it.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can give it to me.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But you will never give it to me.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We have been together for seven years.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
My Lin Lin is so good.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I am so tired, Bai Wu.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You have been together for seven years.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He is still the same...

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Stop it.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Qi Yonglong!

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The three birds are coming to the gate.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:45,240
Outback shopï¿½

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
I can't live a life without you.

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
The number you have dialed is now at

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the bottom of the screen.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,600
The number you have dialed is now at the bottom of the screen.

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
Since you are the one who has fallen into the bottom of the screen,

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
buy a lottery

71
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
and get another one.

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,000
Dad,

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
give me a five-dollar prize.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Who is it?

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,400
Whatever.

76
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,200
What's going on?

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Is it the real one?

78
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,400
Where is it?

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,200
Only I can see it.

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Let's give it a try.

81
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
It's a lottery.

82
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Is it the number on the screen

83
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
that is dialed at the bottom of the screen?

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Let's try again.

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,400
Dad,

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,800
I'll get two more.

87
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm hit.

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm all hit.

89
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm rich now.

90
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
My phone is not bad.

91
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,000
100% is the real prize.

92
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Let's try this 0%.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can't live a life without you.

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
I can really see the success rate.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
This is the jade stone.

96
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
It's a system inside.

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Kid,

98
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
you are a little stubborn.

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
You should be careful.

100
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,400
You should keep your hands up.

101
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Dad,

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,000
give me another five-dollar prize.

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm hit.

104
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm hit.

105
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm hit.

106
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm hit.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm hit.

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm hit.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,800
I'm hit.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm hit.

111
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
The score is 3860.

112
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
The first one on the lottery

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
represents the winning rate.

114
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Unfortunately, the winning rate is unknown.

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
If we know the winning rate,

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,800
we can get 100 or other

117
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
winning rate.

118
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,800
What's going on?

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
Six in one row.

120
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
How could this be?

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
So,

122
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
the success rate is

123
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
the problem I want to know.

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't even make it.

125
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,800
Boss,

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I'm lucky today.

127
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,200
What's the good luck?

128
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,800
Boss,

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,800
you want to be a kid,

130
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
you want to be a man.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
This kid is really a kid.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,200
If I really win,

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,600
I'll be in trouble.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
If I win,

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,400
I'll be in trouble.

136
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,000
Boss,

137
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I'm lucky.

138
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm lucky.

139
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm lucky.

140
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
I'm so lucky.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Give me a second.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Young man,

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
good luck is good luck.

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't be obsessed.

145
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,800
It's okay.

146
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
I'm so lucky.

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
What if I win the whole lottery?

148
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
I don't believe you.

149
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,400
Lucky is

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,200
15.

151
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,200
It's not easy.

152
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
You've used up

153
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
the good luck

154
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
for a year.

155
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Young man,

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,600
don't be obsessed.

157
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
You're reading a book.

158
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm so lucky.

159
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm not pretending.

160
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm just talking.

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm on the stage.

162
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,000
Boss,

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm so lucky.

164
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Yes.

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,400
No.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,600
15.

167
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,400
30.

168
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,200
100.

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,000
What's this?

170
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,800
200.

171
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
The day is bright.

172
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,000
Let me win the whole lottery.

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How much is the heart

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
of the Chinese people?

175
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
50,000.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,600
50,000.

177
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
How much is it?

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

179
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
It's so annoying.

180
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,400
As long as I have the success rate,

181
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,400
I can change my fate.
