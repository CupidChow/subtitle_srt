1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
and I only wanted to kick you some time just now.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,640
That anom kwod was soьте like walking in the rain bricks

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,780
inatarail

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,400
Don't

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,540
Don't, don't

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,820
A hundred videos of him

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,020
And from the тоже

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,640
Really nothing

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll get you.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is there ice cubes?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, wait for me.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll tear your mouth apart.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But you can't shout.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Otherwise, it's all good.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're in our hands now.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you hand him over to the police,

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
you'll wait for the old man to wear it.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll do it.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll do it.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wait for the old man to wear it.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What do you want?

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I know you and An Jin Qian Zhuang are in the same team.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want you to help me get all the illegal evidence of An Jin Qian Zhuang.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How is that possible?

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If Boss Meng finds out, I'll be dead.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You'll take your life for this.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're the only chance to take the most credit.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I...

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Can you really help me?

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're going to catch a big fish.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not interested in catching a big fish.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Fine.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll trust you.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Although Boss Meng is very cautious,

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know that

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
he's hiding the evidence and the information.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's the place?

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The heaven's hall.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The heaven's hall is the secret base of An Jin Qian Zhuang.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The money and accounts are all stored in the secret base.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Every Monday, the date of the meeting will be open to the people.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll take this opportunity to send you out.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Get ready to move.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Boss, I'm going to go up.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What's wrong with him?

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's here because he knows I'm here with you.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He's worried about me.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So he must come with me.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Tell him that I haven't opened the window yet.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't go there.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm still here.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You want to help me to get down here

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and then you'll come down to me today, right?

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm telling you.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm here to help you.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Fine.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't mention you at that time.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm so scared.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What are you doing here?

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Get out.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Boss, no, no, no.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm going to use this stove.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The rumour is that I can't use it.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Fine.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go over there.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Touch it first before it's too salty.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Then you can get out.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't be so stubborn.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can't use it.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll go get you.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll go get you.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll go get you.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Boss, I'm sorry.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll go get you.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll go get you.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Chef, go to the kitchen.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You two, help me move this.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Tang Kun?

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Bai Wu?

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Li Qingqing?

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A dangerous police officer.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The owner is in danger.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How could you...

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You...

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Come here.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Catch him.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're going to catch him.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Xitou, didn't you say that the probability of success is 90%?

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The probability of success is 90%

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The probability of danger is 99%

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're going to be screwed.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Leave it to me.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Come on.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He doesn't like it.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I like it.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Bai Wu.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Bai Wu.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Bai Wu, wake up.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Bai Wu.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Bai Wu.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Bai Wu.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How is it?

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's fine.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Where is this?

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It should be at the bottom of the ship.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We have to take care of it.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I have a way.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll let him pay.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hurry up.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wait a minute.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can't find the location.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't move.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Come on.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Master Bai.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We meet again.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Peng Kun.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll give you 20 million.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's go.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't worry.

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
After you die,

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll make sure you're a good heir.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Throw them into the sea.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What are you doing?

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't touch him.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A man's sea.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Bullshit.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What are you doing?

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I dare to touch him.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm not a man with you.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He dares to laugh at me, right?

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Stay away from him.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't touch him.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm telling you.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Master Tang,

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I know the secret behind you.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Secret?

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What secret?

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll kill you if you kill me.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Keep talking.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Recently,

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the three-star team has launched a large number of cultural relics.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
One of them is related to the warehouse of the museum

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and the camp.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
As long as they combine them together,

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and then follow the culture of the Aichi Lake,

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
we can get a treasure.

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
A treasure?

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What treasure?

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We can't let others know.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Master Tang.

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That treasure.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That treasure.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's it.

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You want peace?

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll kill you.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll kill you.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You want to see your Aichi Lake?

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What should we do next?

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's go out first.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go.

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is WeChat.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Call the police.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hello, we want to call the police.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We are being fined.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Can you guys be on the boat?

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let them come in.

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes, we must come in.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Xitong,

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
the police are coming.

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We need to find the evidence.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We will destroy 100% of the evidence.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Where's Ye'er?

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
She's gone.

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Master Tang.

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Go to the Aichi Lake.

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mo Yi.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll go to the information center.

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Wait.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's go together.

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't need this.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can send her away.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Let's go.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll go to the Aichi Lake.
