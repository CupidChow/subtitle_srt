1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Chief, please help me this time.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You only give me a few words.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
I don't know, I don't understand.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There is a system in Yuwen.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,500
System?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Jin Shao wants to be the third prince.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then I can only help you to live a peaceful life.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You are born to be a great star.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
You can relax and be a good aunt.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But for me,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
it's fun to be a good aunt.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We just got here.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Who did it?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a boy named Bai Wu.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Bai Wu?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But I really understand.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He is dead.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He still can't die.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I have a way.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I let him die.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Do you understand?

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let him die.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Bai Wu?

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Bai Wu?

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Bai Wu?

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No wonder you are in the key room.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You are always pressing me.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why are you so stubborn?

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You want to turn the game.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is the last chance for you to win.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You will die this time.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Bai Wu.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will go with you.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will go alone.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Wait for me.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will go with you.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ji You Long.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am coming.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I am coming.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Qingqing.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Xiao Xiao.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Bai Wu.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Long time no see.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't come here.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Come.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Come.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Come.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Take off your coat.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hurry up.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't worry.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There is nothing here.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There is no police.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Very good.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are here because of your head and mouth.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How do you know?

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I would know if you had been a little more open.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Who told you?

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Master Shen,

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you want to talk nonsense.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come here.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come here.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I finally got the system.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let them go.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But I am stupid.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How?

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let them go first.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You dare to mention the conditions with me, right?

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You don't want the system to kill me.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ji You Long.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You dare to say that.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Get out.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's okay.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's okay.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Bai Wu.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I am sorry.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's okay.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's okay.

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You are here.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are here.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You are here.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You are here.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are here.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's okay.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You go first.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Go first.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will go first.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Go.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And him.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Him, right?

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It smells good.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Ji You Long,

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you dare to touch me.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I will kill you.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Kill me?

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I am so scared.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Bai Wu,

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
you hurt me so badly.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You have to compensate me.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How about this?

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You are so generous.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let me breathe.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will let him go.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How is it?

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ji You Long.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Bai Wu,

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
you know me.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have nothing to be upset about.

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You don't want to hurt yourself.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I just want to hit him.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How about this?

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I will give you another chance.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I count to three.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
One, two, three.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Look.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Look.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Look.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's so scary.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Look at his face.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you like it?

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Me?

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Ji You Long.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ji You Long.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ji You Long.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Ji You Long.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ji You Long.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ji You Long.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Ji You Long.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ji You Long.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ji You Long.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ji You Long.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Ji You Long.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ji You Long.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ji You Long.

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ji You Long.

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ji You Long.

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Ji You Long.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ji You Long.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Ji You Long.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ji You Long.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ji You Long.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Ji You Long.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Ji You Long.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Ji You Long.

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ji You Long.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ji You Long.

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Ji You Long.

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ji You Long.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ji You Long.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Ji You Long.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Tell me.

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
How did the system start?

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How dare you say that?

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll kill you now.

157
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I...

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm the system

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that starts

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
the blood on the blood.

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll kill you.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're not a criminal.

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You lied to me.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I did it.

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But...

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But what?

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He has no energy now.

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He's a murderer.

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Otherwise, you'd think you can kill him.

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
How can you get the energy?

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let him go.

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I've already threatened you

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
with nothing.

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I helped him here.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I didn't want to.

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Besides,

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
this is between men.

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll kill him.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll kill myself.

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You...

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't try to get the system.

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're a good man.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's wrong with you?

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're a bad guy.

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're like a criminal.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm not bad.

190
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not bad.

191
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Bai Wu.

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Go.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's go together.

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have a system.

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Nothing.

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's go.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's go.

198
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840
Do good things.

199
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,040
Do good things without any trouble.

200
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,720
If you get the gratitude,

201
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,680
you can use the system.

202
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,600
Really.

203
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,920
If you let me go now,

204
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,360
I will definitely thank you.

205
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
Maybe you will turn on the system.

206
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,960
Come on.

207
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,920
Do you think I'm stupid?

208
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,840
I didn't lie to you.

209
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
I did too little good things.

210
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,440
The system is too cruel.

211
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,520
The energy is transparent.

212
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Now it's like this.

213
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,160
Do good things.

214
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
Do good things.

215
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,400
Am I not a good person?

216
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,840
Do you think I'm stupid?

217
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,480
The song of the city

218
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,000
The spring and the rain of the heart

219
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,000
The song of the city

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
The light of the country

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,760
The song of the city

222
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,480
The song of the city

223
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,440
The song of the city

224
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,360
The song of the city

225
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,640
The song of the city

226
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,160
The song of the city

227
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Who is the fighter who weepgment

228
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,160
Who follows my sour eyes

229
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,760
finished in the sundown

230
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,160
advanced in the dark

231
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,600
