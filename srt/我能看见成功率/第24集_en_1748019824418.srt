1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Coming soon

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,500
What still space is there?

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,320
Nab her

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,360
Fatty Twelve

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,080
And they returned our line,

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,120
and they told us wtih to take.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,920
What's wrong?

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,840
It's okay.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,840
Xu Ying mouvement.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,760
🐴

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,920
You are a stalker,

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,840
who should answer?

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,960
You trás me

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,020
Starry morning

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,380
Flower so many him

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,580
Coldly fight

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,460
The play in the dead

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,180
Buying place

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,440
You stopped

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,160
How about that

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,160
I found two people too.

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
These are all the Yanpies.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
They are all Yanpies.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
No way.

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
We didn't report them.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
It's impossible.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
The first one is the last one to be sent down.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,160
You are so stupid.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
There is nothing you can do.

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Listen to me.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
You are all liars.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
These are all Yanpies.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
You will know if you fall.

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
Trust me.

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
If you fall, I will be the one to lose.

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Master.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Master.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Master.

39
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
This is a question.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,160
You are the one to lose.

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Master.

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Master is right.

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
I am the master.

44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
Beat him.

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Beat him.

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Are you really the Yanpies?

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
I am the Yanpies.

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
You are the Yanpies.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
We are the Yanpies.

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
We are the Yanpies.

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
We are the Yanpies.

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
We are the Yanpies.

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
We are the Yanpies.

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
We are the Yanpies.

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
We are the Yanpies.

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
We are the Yanpies.

57
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
We are the Yanpies.

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Yanpies.

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Master.

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Are you okay?

61
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
We are the Yanpies.

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Yanpies.

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Master, are you okay?

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
I am fine.

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
I have reached the top of the mountain.

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Say it.

67
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Master.

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Master.

69
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Hurry up.

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
We are going to kill you.

71
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Hurry up.

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Don't run away.

73
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
They are running away.

74
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Oh no.

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
They are really running away.

76
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
The entrance is over there.

77
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
They are running away.

78
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
The police will be here soon.

79
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
It's been a long time.

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
You are acting.

81
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
If I am still in the hospital,

82
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
I am afraid I will be killed by you.

83
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
It seems that

84
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
I can't hide anything from you.

85
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
Give it to me.

86
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
Master Mingluo.

87
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
No.

88
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Uncle Xiao.

89
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
We are going to kill you.

90
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
When did you know

91
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
I was the master of the building?

92
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Tonight.

93
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
I told the hospital that

94
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
we have sent the people to the hospital yesterday.

95
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
But I'm telling you.

96
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Everyone's condition is different.

97
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,800
We should get ready.

98
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,700
Lord Xu!

99
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,180
Please come in.

100
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,280
Come on!

101
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,860
It's okay to start all over now.

102
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,960
In your dream,

103
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,400
I want to use it right now.

104
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,840
I never expected

105
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,980
I could come here in this time.

106
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,340
I can't see off.

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,660
You're her privy

108
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,780
as well as her family member.

109
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,920
Or Gu Yun Zhai's real personality,

110
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,180
why are you

111
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,360
Spell farming with sweet potatoes?

112
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,560
I was here

113
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,260
just to save Ah Yu,

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,060
my wife,

115
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,560
picking up on my needs

116
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,240
by looking for a condition

117
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,580
to save Ah Yu like this.

118
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,180
You can't even be a doctor.

119
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,700
Why do you believe them?

120
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,020
The doctor has given up on treatment.

121
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,280
If it wasn't for the power of the master's

122
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,580
antipyretic poison,

123
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,180
Ah Yu would have died long ago.

124
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,900
The power of the master's antipyretic poison

125
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,100
is the same as the power of the master's antipyretic poison.

126
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,300
Yes.

127
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,180
It's the same as you once had.

128
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,420
Once?

129
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,180
We've known the power for two hours.

130
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,580
I can't say more.

131
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,380
Bai Wu,

132
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,460
do you think you can stand on the Holy Hall

133
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,460
with your own power?

134
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,060
Yes.

135
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,980
I will.

136
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,060
Okay.

137
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,260
Very good.

138
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,580
If you can restore the power of the antipyretic poison again,

139
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,580
please help me save Ah Yu.

140
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,380
This...

141
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,780
But I don't know what to do with the power.

142
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,980
Wu Ye, be careful.

143
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,580
Bai Wu.

144
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,780
Promise me.

145
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
Promise me.

146
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,980
Okay.

147
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,380
I promise you.

148
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,780
Very good.

149
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,180
Ah Yu.

150
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,580
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,580
Xiao Shuang.

152
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,580
Xiao Shuang.

153
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
Xiao Shuang.

154
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,580
Xiao Shuang.

155
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
Xiao Shuang.

156
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Xiao Shuang.

157
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,180
He just saved his wife.

158
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,980
What's wrong with him?

159
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,180
What's wrong with him?

160
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,780
He just saved his wife.

161
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,180
We...

162
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,580
We don't know...

163
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,580
You don't know.

164
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,580
You don't know anything.

165
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,580
I've never had a father.

166
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,580
My grandpa was busy.

167
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,380
He brought me up with a big husband.

168
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,580
He's my closest relative.

169
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,780
He's my father.

170
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,380
I've lost my father.

171
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,580
I've lost my uncle.

172
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,780
Xiao Shuang.

173
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,580
Don't chase him.

174
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,780
It's all your fault.

175
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,980
It's all your fault.

176
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,380
It's your father.

177
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,980
He didn't harm you.

178
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,980
I shouldn't have known you.

179
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,180
You're all bad people.

180
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,980
Xiao Shuang.

181
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,580
Don't go.

182
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,580
Wait for the police.

183
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,980
Master Wu.

184
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
The police have been checked by the police.

185
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,380
The police found many evidence

186
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,380
of the police and Ming Long

187
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,580
and the money-saving money

188
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,380
in Xiao Zi's computer.

189
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
They can't escape.

190
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,380
It's a pity

191
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,980
that the police didn't find

192
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,780
any clues about Shen Gong Tang.

193
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,180
Shen Gong Tang is so deep.

194
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,780
Is it Jin Yong Long?

195
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980

You can hear it now.

What's wrong with you?

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,380
Don't just care about him.

221
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,580
Your hair is also in my hands.
