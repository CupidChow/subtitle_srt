00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,400
Your Highness.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,640
Greetings, Senior Guifu.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,640
Congratulations.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,000
You've passed the Gu Yu's Wenshin Bureau.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,400
Where are my friends?

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,600
Don't worry.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,200
They're fine.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,440
I just cooperated with

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,800
the Wenshin Bureau.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,240
Your parents didn't come here.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,520
Are you disappointed?

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
Come. Sit down.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,840
Senior.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,640
What's going on

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,080
with the products of the Wenshin Bureau

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
and the JRA auction?

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,520
It's a long story.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,240
28 years ago,

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,160
my master sent me this box of Gu Yu.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,320
I was young and weak.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,200
The wolves in the town

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,440
said I was only 20 years old.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,280
I've been in the Wenshin Bureau

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,160
to fulfill the long-term wish of the old.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
Not long ago,

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,360
my sister was sick.

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,000
Gu Yu made me

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,240
choose one of them.

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,160
Finally, I made a difficult choice.

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,040
My sister, Gu Yu,

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,920
recognized me as her master.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,640
I gave her the ability

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
to help me fulfill my wish.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,480
Then,

36
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,720
my body was better than ever.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,480
After I saw the fire,

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,040
I was carried around with a pile of national treasures

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,160
coses and was brought back to Taiwan.

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,840
As we traveled to Europe

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,200
the request of theolia

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,000
humiliated me in the past.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Until today,

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,640
you have to support my live.

45
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,200
My Lord,

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,020
I elf the treasure of the overseas March operating

47
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,240
today.

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,040
Are you a hundred-year-old today?

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Then, these two pieces of Yanping?

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,040
All I did was to prevent the Divine Palace Hall from being burned.

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Then, Senior, why did the Wenshin Bureau recognize you?

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Of course, it was because I met the old master.

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,040
The old master was the one who ordered the head, so he recognized the new master.

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Then, what I used to use was...

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,040
It was just an ancient jade to gain energy and to exchange it with you.

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,040
He really has a lot of real power.

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Come, show him to me.

58
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Look.

59
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Old Huoji, it's been over 100 years.

60
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Are you okay?

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Go ahead.

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Take good care of him.

63
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,040
The Wenshin Bureau

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,040
The Wenshin Bureau has recognized the new system,

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
the system's full function,

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
the system's upgrade,

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
the upgrade progress is 1%.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,040
The system is finally fully revived.

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,040
The upgrade progress is 1%.

70
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Senior, the upgrade progress of the system is 1%.

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
How long does it take?

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Give him some more time.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,040
This guy's support for me is almost over.

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,040
You mean, I became the master of the Wenshin Bureau, and your skills...

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Senior, I don't want this jade anymore.

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
You're so stupid.

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
This is not how it is.

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Do you know why the jade will make me stay here forever?

79
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Because...

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,040
You're the one who made the Wenshin Bureau?

81
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Yes, it's not right.

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
The Wingshin Bureau is also a part of the people's heart.

83
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,040
But the people's heart is not so easy to change.

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,040
I was the Wenshin Bureau,

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,040
but I was able to survive 30, 40, 50 years.

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:23,040
But I never thought that I would be able to steal someone's skills.

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Senior, you mean, you didn't want to die in the Wingshin Bureau?

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Gu Yuchan...

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Now that I think about it, I shouldn't have been greedy.

90
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,040
That's why I killed everyone.

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
You can't say that.

92
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
This is also a normal thing.

93
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Life has its own destiny.

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,040
It's always worth it to be greedy.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,040
You must remember, Xiaocao.

96
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Wenshin Bureau is a good choice.

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
It's not like you always choose the right person.

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,040
From now on, don't think about the future.

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,040
You'll end up with the closest person.

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
That...

101
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Okay.

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
I don't remember.

103
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,040
About the Shen Gong Hall,

104
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
according to my knowledge,

105
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Shen Gong is another person who has a harmonious history.

106
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,040
But he died in person.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,040
His harmonious history has passed on.

108
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,040
But there is no one who can live with his heart.

109
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
After meeting him,

110
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,040
his one descendant found my jade.

111
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,040
He wanted to go to Wenshin Bureau

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,040
to discover the secret of the power of jade.

113
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,040
So he took the opportunity to study the jade.

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Later, he studied the jade.

115
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,040
In order to ensure that the results of the study are not out of control,

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
the descendant of Shen Gong was also created.

117
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,040
The master of the temple came to the research institute.

118
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,040
So my parents were killed by the Shen Gong Hall.

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Although the Shen Gong Hall was not recognized by the ancient jade,

120
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,040
the study of so many years must have gained

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,040
the power of many ancient jades.

122
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,040
You must be careful.

123
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
I remember.

124
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Senior, I'm going to rest.

125
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
It's been 100 years.

126
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm tired.

127
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:59,040
I should rest well.

128
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Senior.

129
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Senior Guifu.

130
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Senior Guifu.

131
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Guifu, you finally let him die.

132
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Today's matter has been settled.

133
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Get ready.

134
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Senior.

135
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Senior, what he did is already done.

136
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Now, Guobao is in your hands.

137
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,040
He is responsible for your hand.

138
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Senior, you finally let him die.

139
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Senior, you finally let him die.

140
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Senior, what happened to you?

141
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,040
I have to take him back to the temple.

142
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Senior, you finally let him go.

143
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,040
You must be careful.

144
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Senior, you finally let him die.

145
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,480
Daily Скena

146
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,080
Brother Xia's

147
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,200
It's all right, everyone.

148
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,960
panoramic vision

149
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,600
53%

150
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Come on, it's the

151
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,140
first time for the

152
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,520
Hu Zhong Day τον

153
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Let's have a drink.

154
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Fatty, I'm not talking about you.

155
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
You're too stingy.

156
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
You opened the shareholders' meeting on the street.

157
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
That's right.

158
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
How did he get his name here?

159
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Half-life sugar.

160
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
What's the name of the man?

161
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
How can we call him a man?

162
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
We were originally half-life,

163
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
half-life,

164
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
and we were all shareholders.

165
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
What's the name of half-life sugar?

166
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
I'm afraid that your dad's customers are running away.

167
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
If you come here and buy something,

168
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
you'll lose half-life.

169
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
How can you say that?

170
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
You can't say that.

171
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Dad, come on, Fatty.

172
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
Let me toast you.

173
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Wait a minute.

174
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Master Wu,

175
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,520
we're not close.

176
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,520
You wanted to be friends,

177
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
so I wanted to kiss you.

178
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
We were originally

179
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,520
the beginning of the Yuan family's road trip.

180
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
We were the beginning of the war.

181
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
But Master Wu was generous and generous.

182
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
He was not only generous,

183
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
but also helped me to go through the difficulties.

184
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
He also led me into the shareholders' meeting.

185
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
I was originally

186
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
a broken-in shop in the shareholders' meeting.

187
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
My dream is to open a shop

188
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
that belongs to me.

189
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Now I've realized my dream.

190
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Master Wu, you can't be silent.

191
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Here, I toast you.

192
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Good brother.

193
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm drunk.

194
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
I'm drunk.

195
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
Miss Li,

196
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
I have to toast you, too.

197
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Actually, the fate of the three of us

198
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
was decided in the first play.

199
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
What do you mean?

200
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
The night pearl you bought from Master Wu

201
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
was the one Master Wu picked up from me.

202
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm 300,000 yuan.

203
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Give me half of it.

204
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,520
You're my 300,000 yuan.

205
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
That's it?

206
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Miss Li,

207
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
you're a big enterprise.

208
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I know.

209
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
You can't see

210
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
the shares of my half-baked soup.

211
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
But I think this shares...

212
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I can see it.

213
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Because it's not just the shares.

214
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
It's also the fate of the three of us.

215
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Miss Li,

216
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Master Wu,

217
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
they're all in the wine.

218
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
They're all in the wine.

219
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
They're all in the wine.

220
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Cheers.

221
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Open the door.

222
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Yes.

223
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
This way.

224
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
The warning.

225
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
The treasure is safe.

226
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
100% safe.

227
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
What's wrong?

228
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Here.

229
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
The system just told me

230
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
that the treasure might be lost.

231
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
System,

232
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
are the treasure theft

233
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
a divine treasure?

234
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
The total is 90%

235
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Boss,

236
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
hit the boss.

237
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Stop.

238
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
The treasure is gone.

239
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
The name is dirty.

240
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
The treasure theft is inevitable.

241
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Do you know that?

242
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Put it away.

243
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Don't think about it.

244
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
We've received

245
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
a mission to steal the treasure.

246
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Who gave you the mission?

247
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
It's me.

248
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
What's going on?

249
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
What's going on?

250
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Two hours ago,

251
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
I received a call from a secret agent.

252
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
He said that the people in the temple

253
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
are coming to steal the treasure tonight.

254
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Secret agent?

255
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
And they can also

256
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
tell the truth accurately.

257
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
They're the security guards.

258
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
They're the patrols.

259
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
They even know the password.

260
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I thought about it.

261
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
I decided to transfer this treasure

262
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
to a safe place first.

263
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Okay.

264
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Everyone, thank you.

265
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Go back first.

266
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Okay.

267
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
You go back first.

268
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
I'll handle the rest.

269
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Okay, Chief Sun.

270
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I'll go back first, Chief Sun.

271
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Xitong,

272
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
is the treasure safe now?

273
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,520
The treasure is 70% of the treasure.

274
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Hurry up.

275
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
The train is coming.

276
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Why?

277
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
It's a divine treasure.

278
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
A divine treasure?

279
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
No.

280
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
What divine treasure?

281
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Where is it?

282
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Chief Sun.

283
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
It's the person in the temple.

284
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Kid.

285
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
How did you know?
