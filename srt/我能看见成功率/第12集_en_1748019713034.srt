Episode 1

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,000
You didn't raise me, did you?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,200
What do you want?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,200
Of course, I want to pay for the money, brother.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,600
I'll pay 5 million.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,800
No, no, no, wait.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
Plus interest,

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,400
and mental loss.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll pay 8 million.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800
That thing is a sample.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
Why should I pay you?

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
What's wrong with the sample?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,200
He wants to pay you.

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,800
What's your problem?

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
He's my friend.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,600
Of course, I want to pay for his friend.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,200
No.

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,000
Here.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,600
Good.

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,600
You're a good man.

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,200
I'll wait for your words.

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,800
You want to pay for it, right?

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Okay.

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,600
You can explain it to me.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Say it.

26
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,200
10 million.

27
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
10 million?

28
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
What?

29
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,600
Not much, right?

30
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,200
What's wrong?

31
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,600
I'm scared.

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,000
Didn't you say you have to pay for your friend's business?

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
You should pay for it.

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,400
Is it because of money?

35
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,800
You can't do it without your friend.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Brothers, I know.

37
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,600
You're not rich.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,800
Brother,

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
you're not rich.

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Why do you have to graduate?

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Brother,

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,400
you bought the good stuff.

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
You broke the brothers' dinner.

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
You even hurt my face.

45
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
10 million.

46
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,200
How much?

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,000
10 million.

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,600
How much?

49
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,200
10 million.

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Isn't our boss' face money?

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
10 million.

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
It's not much.

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
I just didn't expect

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
to see the face of the boss in front of the gold.

55
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,200
Such a bad money.

56
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,000
What are you talking about?

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,800
What are you talking about?

58
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,600
What are you talking about?

59
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Brother, brother.

60
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,200
They're all good brothers.

61
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,800
They're all good brothers.

62
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,400
Get lost.

63
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
There's 10 million.

64
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Take it.

65
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,600
We're in the same team.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Let's go.

67
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,600
No, no, no.

68
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,400
Master Wu, you're so mean.

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
You regret it?

70
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,600
You think you're missing?

71
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
Kid,

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,200
because you two

73
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,000
can't even see me.

74
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,200
How about this?

75
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,000
10 million.

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,800
You're going to kill me

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,600
if you buy your life.

78
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
You, you,

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
you're going to give me a break?

80
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
As long as you don't move me,

81
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I'll kick you out.

82
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Okay.

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
You're a kind person.

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you dare?

85
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Just leave me alone.

86
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,600
What are you reading?

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
The big flower fountain, the five-star hotel,

88
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
all of you are leaving.

89
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
But if you lose one game,

90
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,800
you'll still be free to write a song for me.

91
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
Are you stupid?

92
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Are you a secretary?

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll just read it.

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Okay.

95
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,600
The system is working.

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,800
Three.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Six.

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Open.

99
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,600
One more.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Six.

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,400
Open.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,800
Five.

103
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,400
One more.

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Six.

105
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Seven.

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,600
No.

107
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,400
One more.

108
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,400
Five.

109
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,400
No.

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,600
One more.

111
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Four.

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Five.

113
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,400
Six.

114
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,000
Seven.

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Eight.

116
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,400
Nine.

117
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,000
Open.

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
I don't believe you.

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Five.

120
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,200
I won.

121
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
He really made this little guy win.

122
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,800
Fu Yan.

123
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,800
Are you a betrothal?

124
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,000
I admit it.

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,200
Stop it.

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,600
Stop.

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,000
Boss Meng.

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Are you a loser?

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
A loser?

130
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
You're a loser.

131
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,200
Yes, a loser.

132
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
The secretary is a martial artist.

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
He must have a power.

134
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Put your hand down.

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Put your hand down.

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Put your hand down.

137
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Boss Meng.

138
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,800
Why is the fire so big?

139
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Calm down.

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,200
Miss Dita, why are you here?

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,200
I heard that

142
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,800
you asked my friends to come over to see it.

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Bai Wu.

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,800
What are you playing?

145
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,400
You're so new.

146
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Is this what you're playing?

147
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Mr. Bai is your friend?

148
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Of course.

149
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,600
Mr. Bai is one of the most important partners

150
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
in Jiang City in our world.

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Put it away.

152
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,200
Put it away.

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,800
Brother.

154
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Why didn't you say it earlier?

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Looks like you have some misunderstandings

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
between you two.

157
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Misunderstandings?

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
It's a misunderstanding.

159
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why don't I solve it?

160
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,600
No.

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
It's all solved.

162
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,800
Brother.

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
That's all.

164
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
What's the problem?

165
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Listen up.

166
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,000
Who dares to offend Mr. Bai

167
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
and tear his skin?

168
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Listen up.

169
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Since you two have solved the misunderstanding,

170
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll leave Mr. Bai alone.

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,600
I'll leave now.

172
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,000
No.

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Miss.

174
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,800
I told you about that last time.

175
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Good.

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,400
I asked the finance department to make a contract.

177
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
We'll talk about it in detail.

178
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
I'll take it.

179
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,200
What are you doing here?

180
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,800
I heard from the team that

181
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
you had some trouble.

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,200
Did you come to the classroom?

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Miss Dida.

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,200
You saved my life today.

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm the one who saved your life.

186
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Yes.

187
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,400
Mr. Wu.

188
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
You saved my life.

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Miss Dida saved my life.

190
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,800
From now on,

191
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll take care of

192
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
your life.

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,000
Fatty.

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Here.

195
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
One thousand yuan.

196
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
One thousand?

197
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
My life is so valuable.

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you thinking about?

199
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
This is your Tangguo Lake's female picture.

200
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
The car is a thousand times smaller.

201
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,000
What?

202
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,200
My picture is real?

203
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,400
Yes.

204
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,400
By the way,

205
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
how did you get the money

206
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
for the previous project?

207
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,400
I can't talk about the cooperation.

208
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,800
They borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars from the first market.

209
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
They gave it to them.

210
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
At the same time, they can provide me

211
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,400
some information that I can't get.

212
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,800
You agreed?

213
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Think about it again.

214
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
What's there to think about?

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
They are from the high-end generation.

216
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,000
You gave them the money.

217
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
They are from the wrong.

218
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,200
It seems that they didn't give them the money.

219
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
They didn't do anything wrong.

220
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
What's wrong with you?

221
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
In this world,

222
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
there is no need for a dark face.

223
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Even if you don't agree,

224
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
it still exists.

225
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,400
It doesn't matter if it exists.

226
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
We can't eliminate the dark face.

227
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
We can't do anything wrong.

228
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
You have a problem with the three levels.

229
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,600
I'm the one who is responsible for the dark face.

230
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
You think it's easy to get hurt?

231
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,000
This world is not just about the rules.

232
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can easily turn the wheel

233
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
if you don't know the rules.

234
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
Because if you don't agree,

235
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
it's not the other side.

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,200
I think you have a problem with the three levels.

237
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
You are helping them.

238
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Did I just save you?

239
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,600
I forced them to borrow money.

240
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
Then I have to thank you.

241
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
You are the best.

242
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,800
I can give you the money

243
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,200
for the cooperation.

244
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,400
I refuse.

245
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,400
Master Wu.

246
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,200
Whatever.

247
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
Master Wu.

248
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,800
Master Wu.

249
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,400
Calm down.

250
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Miss Di.

251
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,600
Miss Di.

252
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
He is a man of wisdom.

253
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,800
Let's go back.

254
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,400
Go back.

255
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Miss Di.

256
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Who hurt you?

257
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,800
Jin Shao.

258
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The kid is on the way.

259
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,300
Jin Shao.

260
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,860
I just came back from the real world.

261
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,800
After I go back togroaning,

262
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,200
I can shoot with the menorahetri.

263
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,620
XYZ means 30%

264
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,480
30%?!

265
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,700
Your sister has problems with me

266
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,500
Let's go down and sleep

267
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,200
The拆 enchanting is with 1 mana for equivalent height of 71%.

268
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,720
ジ verses 120 more!

269
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,700
It's useless to use an punch!

270
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,400
His opponent must have been hard-pressed.
