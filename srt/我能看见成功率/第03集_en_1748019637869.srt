1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Ok.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,220
Look!

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,400
30K.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,220
What a beautiful louse!

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,720
She is pretty.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,600
The long leg wasrolling so that woman is still here.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,500
So elegant.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,720
cheated

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,400
Yi Bai

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,580
"...스테els

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,220
Trans perfekt

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm at 300 million

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,060
Hand me the official account

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,280
300 millions!

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,540
pardon

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,620
I have a deposit before you get married

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,220
Yo...!

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,220
Then...

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,220
It's still 15,000.

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,220
The account is 30,000.

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,220
Oh my god!

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,220
It's 30,000!

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,220
Yi'er,

24
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,220
did you introduce your blind date?

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,220
I'm fine now. I'm here to see you.

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,220
Don't lie to me.

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,220
This year, I've been cheating on you.

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,220
See you soon.

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,220
You really cheated on me?

30
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,220
Miss,

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,220
your friend should have been cheated on.

32
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,220
How do you know Yi'er was cheated on?

33
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,220
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,220
Let's go.

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,220
30,000.

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,220
This way, 100,000 loans will be paid back.

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,220
The loan loan loan is 40%.

38
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,220
40%?

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,220
The loan loan loan of the money-saving company?

40
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,220
Is it the gold-globe-polling?

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,220
The gold-globe-polling is 100%...

42
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,220
I just want to be better than you.

43
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,220
The land is mine.

44
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,220
I'm not a good person.

45
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,220
I'm not a good person.

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,220
I just want to be better than you.

47
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,220
The land is higher than you.

48
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,220
I can easily kill you.

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,220
I have a system.

50
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,220
Who will be the first to be cheated?

51
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,220
I hate cheating the most.

52
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,220
You have three minutes to make me believe you.

53
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,220
Who said I was cheated?

54
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,220
Two more minutes.

55
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
No,

56
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,220
you little girl, who are you scaring?

57
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,220
The system is working.

58
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,220
The system is working.

59
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,220
The system is working.

60
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,220
The system is working.

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
You are called Dixing Qing.

62
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,220
26 years old this year.

63
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,220
The birthday is on September 30th.

64
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,220
The afternoon is on the 24th.

65
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,220
The time is...

66
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,220
91, 65, 92.

67
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,220
Love is number 0.

68
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,220
Love is number 0.

69
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,220
There is a mark on your butt.

70
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,220
There is a mark on your chest.

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,220
You are cheating.

72
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,220
You told me to say that.

73
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,220
So you are cheating?

74
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,220
Let's go.

75
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,220
Let's talk.

76
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,220
How is it?

77
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,220
Yi'er.

78
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
Yi'er.

79
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,220
Dixing.

80
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,220
This is Mr. Pang.

81
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,220
Who is this?

82
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,220
This is Mr. Bai.

83
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,220
He is my friend.

84
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,220
He is a famous wind-water master in Jiangcheng ancient world.

85
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,220
He is the most famous person.

86
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,220
I brought him here to give you a tour.

87
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,220
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,220
I just want you to meet Mr. Pang.

89
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,220
Mr. Pang is a great professional doctor.

90
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
He is just a little girl.

91
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,220
He is not worth it.

92
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,220
Look at your makeup.

93
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
Let's go.

94
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,220
Let's put on makeup.

95
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,220
But...

96
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Come.

97
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
Mr. Bai.

98
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,220
You are so poor.

99
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,220
You are greedy.

100
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
You just want money.

101
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Here.

102
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Take the money.

103
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,220
Get out.

104
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,220
You are the one who is cheating.

105
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,220
You can cheat those two girls.

106
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,220
You are not qualified to cheat me.

107
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,220
This is not enough.

108
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,220
First, I am not cheating.

109
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,220
Second, Mr. Bai is the student of Miss Qingqing.

110
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,220
I am not that good.

111
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Third, you are not named Pang.

112
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Of course, you are not a professor of the sea and the earth.

113
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,220
You are a student of the university.

114
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,220
You are not a student of the university.

115
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,220
You are the famous famous man in Jiangcheng.

116
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
You are the one who is greedy.

117
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
You are not qualified to cheat.

118
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,220
You are the one who is cheating.

119
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,220
I know it.

120
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,220
You are trying to trick me.

121
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,220
You are so ridiculous.

122
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,220
Who believes you?

123
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,220
How about I prepare your ID number?

124
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Yes.

125
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
Yes.

126
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,220
290320.

127
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,220
1999022.

128
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,220
76621.

129
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,220
Enough.

130
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Am I right?

131
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,220
Mr. Bai, you are really a master.

132
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,220
I am so proud of you.

133
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,220
I just hope you can be a good man.

134
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,220
Don't be too rough.

135
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,220
When I get the ink, I will have the priority.

136
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,220
The priority?

137
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,220
What do you mean?

138
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
You saw it.

139
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
Take the ink.

140
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Take the body.

141
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,220
Wait for me to take it.

142
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,220
Let you try the money.

143
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,220
1.

144
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,220
You are so stupid.

145
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,220
Listen to me.

146
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,220
You still have the money?

147
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Why are you still holding it?

148
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
I know it.

149
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,220
You are trying to trick me?

150
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
Wait for me.

151
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,220
Thank you.

152
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,220
You are welcome.

153
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,220
This is...

154
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,220
Yao Qinghan.

155
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:11,220
I want you to go to the auction of the charity auction of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce in three days.

156
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,220
Wanbao Chamber of Commerce?

157
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,220
Who is the owner?

158
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,220
The boss of Wanbao Chamber of Commerce is called Jin Youlong.

159
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
Jin Youlong?

160
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,220
Do you know him?

161
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,220
Old friend.

162
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,220
I am leaving.

163
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
Jin Youlong.

164
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,220
I didn't expect that you have such a quick chance to come here.

165
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,220
Help me find a person named Bai Wu.

166
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,220
Why do you want to find him?

167
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,220
I have a feeling that he will be completely gone if he doesn't use it for long.

168
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,220
Isn't this my Kun Shao?

169
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
What?

170
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,220
I want to help you to make up for it.

171
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,220
Jin Shao.

172
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
Master Feng Shui of the ancient world.

173
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Didn't you hear about me?

174
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,220
Who?

175
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
Bai Wu?

176
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Help me buy a auction of the charity auction.

177
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,220
It means that our family's identity is not too high.

178
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,220
Don't return it.

179
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,220
What a good person.

180
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,220
How much can the system solve 45,000 yuan?

181
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,220
26%.

182
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,220
Why is the probability of more money being covered less?

183
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,220
What is the advantage of Qi Youlong?

184
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,220
Forget it.

185
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
Don't be afraid of the wind.

186
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
Don't be anxious.

187
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
The charity auction will be held.

188
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Why am I waiting for it?

189
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,220
No.

190
