1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to kill you.

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,700
Xie Tao, is that guy?

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,500
100%

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,900
Damn it.

5
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,800
I just have to leave this place.

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,700
10 minutes away from here.

7
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,900
The death penalty will be 0%

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
That's good.

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,500
Mr. Bai, are you feeling better?

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Xie Tao, since there will be a explosion,

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
will the people who stay here die?

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,500
All the people inside the building have been burned to 13%

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Brother Wu, what's wrong?

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Xiao Xiao, Siting,

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
the accident is coming, please don't trust me.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
You guys leave here immediately.

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
What?

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
I have some news.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Someone ate my bomb and will report it immediately.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
All the people who stay here

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
might die.

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
I'll go to the police station quickly.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
No, if there are too many criminals,

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
they might report it immediately.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,500
What should we do?

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Time is running out.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
You guys go as far as possible.

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
We'll call the police as soon as possible.

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Let's go.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Okay, we'll go now.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Brother Wu, where are you?

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Trust me.

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Let's go.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Head來,

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I can barely walk

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
I can't leave for two days.

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
I want to save him.

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Xidao, how long do I have to stop the explosion?

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Ten minutes, 93%

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Ten minutes? If we find a security assistant...

41
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,500
When the security assistant is in charge, the rate of the crystal snake is 75%.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
The police is coming.

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
The police is coming.

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,500
If we find a security assistant, the rate of the crystal snake will be higher.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Isn't this a dead end?

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
If I don't get attacked, what about the time?

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
The time is 30%

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
It's the highest time.

49
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
We don't have time to talk.

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Brother Wu!

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I'm with you.

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I can't let you go to the risk alone.

53
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
With the car, the success rate is 87%.

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
So high.

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Since that, let's play a new game.

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Okay. What do you do?

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Soul egg!

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
What? I really have nothing.

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Shen Xin, you didn't even go home last night. You must have slept with him.

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,700
That's because he drank too much. I gave him a ride home. I only slept in his sofa.

61
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
You dare to swear? You didn't sleep in his bed.

62
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
I...

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,300
You're a cheater. You dare not swear?

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,300
I just helped him take off some clothes.

65
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,500
What?

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,100
You just asked him to take off clothes? What clothes? Who asked you to take off clothes?

67
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,500
That's because he's been spitting on me. I can only put him on the bed.

68
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,500
Did you sleep with him? You must have slept with him.

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,900
Can you catch up with me? I'm pregnant with your child.

70
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,500
You can't catch up with me. You're a cheater.

71
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,500
What's going on? What are you doing?

72
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
What's going on? What are you doing?

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I can't take it anymore. You're all going to die today.

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
What's going on?

75
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Help! Help!

76
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
What's the password? What's the password?

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
You're all going to die with me.

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
What's the password? What's the password?

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
What's the password?

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Red, yellow, black. How many are the probability of taking off the bomb?

81
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

83
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

84
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

85
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

86
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

89
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

90
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
What's the probability of taking off the bomb?

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Uncle, I'd like a bowl of soup with rice.

95
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Thank you. Here, take a look.

96
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I have a lot of energy.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Add B去

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,160
That's not cool

99
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,380
I almost fell asleep

100
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,360
Stop this

101
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,260
Shivän'sיצon

102
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,180
The bullpen

103
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,720
under that

104
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,220
Howliterate

105
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,040
But you're not

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,080
Let's play regarding

107
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,040
What can I say

108
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,640
How accurately I've learned

109
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,040
Good

110
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,860
Shivän

111
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,860
Where did you get this jade pendant?

112
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
It was left by my parents.

113
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,860
My grandpa has a similar one.

114
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Is there a clue to my parents' family?

115
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,860
Xie Xiao, I have something to ask for.

116
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,860
Can you help me?

117
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,860
No problem.

118
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
You can come to Gu Ying's place tomorrow afternoon.

119
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,860
Okay.

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
But I'll give you a jade pendant first.

121
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,860
My grandpa's surname is a little weird.

122
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,860
Don't be scared by him.

123
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Bai Wu, you're so slow.

124
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
You're the slowest man I've ever seen.

125
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,860
You're the most important hero in my heart.

126
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,860
I'm just fine.

127
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Okay.

128
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Bai Wu, do you like me?

129
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
No.

130
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
I like you.

131
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,860
You're too fast.

132
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Don't you like me at all?

133
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
A little bit.

134
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
Just a little bit.

135
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,860
I don't like you.

136
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
Don't...

137
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,860
Don't you like me?

138
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Don't you like me?

139
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Just a little bit.

140
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I'll give you a little bit.

141
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,860
Just a little bit.

142
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,860
Li Yao.

143
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,860
Hello, Miss Dita.

144
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,860
I've prepared the food.

145
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
So fast?

146
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,860
You're a good girl.

147
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Stop it.

148
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Okay, the first time you're here,

149
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
you should bring a gift.

150
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
I prepared a gift.

151
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
How much is the budget?

152
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
The top of the top.

153
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Brother Wu,

154
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
we can't just leave this here.

155
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,860
Can we make it up to the ordinary?

156
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
Why can't we see people?

157
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Why don't we ask the government?

158
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,860
What power do you have?

159
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
Listen,

160
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
as long as this thing is right,

161
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
I'll take it for him.

162
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
That's right.

163
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Boss Cao, we're here.

164
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Let's take this thing out

165
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
and give it to Mr. Pang.

166
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,860
Mr. Wang, look.

167
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Look.

168
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
Wow, what a good thing.

169
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,860
What a good thing.

170
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
The color of the water is so beautiful.

171
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
The color is so beautiful.

172
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
It's the legendary

173
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
seven star treasure.

174
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Boss Wang, how is it?

175
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,860
I didn't turn you down, did I?

176
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
It's okay.

177
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,860
The color is just perfect.

178
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
The treasure is more complete.

179
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Then let's just as we said.

180
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,860
Okay.

181
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,860
I'm a real man.

182
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Let's just as we said.

183
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
I'll take the 800,000.

184
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
No way.

185
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,860
What 800,000?

186
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
At least 200,000.

187
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,860
Why are you still sitting there?

188
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,860
No, no, no.

189
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Boss Cao,

190
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,860
why are you so serious?

191
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
Didn't we tell Boss Wang

192
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,860
that we'd take the 800,000?

193
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Why are you acting like this now?

194
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
I told you,

195
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,860
I didn't tell him.

196
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Besides,

197
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
my grandpa said

198
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,860
this is the treasure left.

199
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,860
If you didn't wear it,

200
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,860
I wouldn't have sold it.

201
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
You...

202
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,860
200,000.

203
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
Don't come here.

204
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,860
We can't take the 100,000.

205
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,860
Boss Wang, I'm so sorry.

206
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
He...

207
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Let go.

208
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
Take the money.

209
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
200,000.

210
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Boss Cao,

211
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,860
did you hear what Boss Wang said?

212
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Hurry up and bring it out.

213
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Boss Cao,

214
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
give me a hand.

215
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Wait a minute.

216
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
The hand-pulled 6-year-old

217
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,860
is the only one that's been sold.

218
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
Why don't you buy it?

219
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
Buy me?

220
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Why are you here?

221
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,860
Who are you?

222
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,860
What do you mean?

223
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,860
I mean

224
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,860
your 7-star knife is fake.

225
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
Let go.

226
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
I'm the general Cao Cao's descendant.

227
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,860
How can this be fake?

228
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,860
According to my official Cao Cao's background,

229
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,860
there are the Cao family of Liaoning East and South,

230
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,860
the Cao family of Shandong,

231
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,860
and the Cao family of Jiangsu,

232
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,860
and the Jianzhong Village.

233
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,860
They don't have a 7-star knife

234
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
like you.

235
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Which one of you

236
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
has the right to sell it?

237
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
None of you cares about me.

238
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,860
I'm just a treasure.

239
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Fine.

240
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Tell me about the treasure.

241
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,860
Where is it?

242
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
Look.

243
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,860
The water-shrine-shrine-shrine knife.

244
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
And the 7-star knife.

245
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,860
It's so big.

246
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
The water-shrine-shrine

247
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
is the key to the classic Ma Shige.

248
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
It's the 13th century of Ma Shige.

249
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
That's the only thing that's passed on.

250
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
What?

251
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,860
Your ancestor

252
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
has it in the East and South?

253
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,860
The treasure

254
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
is the pearl-flavored

255
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,860
white-haired tiger-head.

256
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
It's not fake,

257
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
but it's not expensive.

258
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,860
It's interesting to read and make money.

259
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,860
What do you mean by that?

260
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,860
Although China

261
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,860
has the earliest discovery

262
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
of the water-shrine-shrine-shrine-shrine.

263
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,860
The 8-star, 8-star, 7-star knife

264
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
is only available

265
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
in the 20th century.

266
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,860
Since it was

267
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
on the treasure

268
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,860
of the East and South,

269
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,860
I'm afraid the coffin

270
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,860
of Cao Cao

271
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
can't be pressed.

272
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Run!

273
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,860
Run!

274
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
You two little kids!

275
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
You lied to me!

276
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
Don't let your friend

277
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
run into you!

278
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
What's going on?

279
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
Thank you.

280
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,860
I know.

281
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Do you want to work together?

282
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
It's okay.

283
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,860
I don't want to see you.

284
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,860
I'll sell you some day.

285
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
How many times do you know?

286
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,860
But you're my friend.

287
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
I'm willing to share my name.

288
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
If you don't mind,

289
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,860
I'll leave this one to you.

290
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,860
This is...

291
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
This is my previous time.

292
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
It's almost

293
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,860
my coffin of Cao Cao.

294
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,860
The Chun Shan City girl

295
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
of Tang Pohu.

296
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
I thought I could make a living

297
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
and make a big living.

298
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
But who knows

299
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,860
the car is the same as the old one.

300
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm sure it's the same.

301
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,860
It's like a car.

302
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
It's good for you.

303
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
I'll be a beggar.

304
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
I can't help it.

305
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,860
The real price is one hundred percent.

306
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,860
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

307
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
I'm a young man.

308
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
I've seen the success.

309
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
I'm a man.

310
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
I'm a brother.

311
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,860
I'm a man.

312
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,860
I'm a man.

313
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
I'm a man.

314
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,860
I'm a man.

315
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,860
I'm a man.

316
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
I'm a man.

317
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,860
I'm a man.

318
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,860
I'm a man.

319
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,860
I'm a man.

320
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,860
I'm a man.

321
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,860
I'm a man.

322
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
I'm a man.

323
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,860
I'm a man.

324
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,860
I'm a man.

325
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,860
I'm a man.

326
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
I'm a man.

327
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
I'm a man.

328
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
I'm a man.

329
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
I'm a man.

330
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
I'm a man.

331
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
I'm a man.

332
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
I'm a man.

333
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
I'm a man.

334
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
I'm a man.

335
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
I'm a man.

336
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,860
I'm a man.

337
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,860
I'm a man.

338
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,860
I'm a man.

339
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
I'm a man.

340
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,860
I'm a man.

341
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,860
I'm a man.

342
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
I'm a man.

343
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,860
I'm a man.

344
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,860
I'm a man.

345
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
I'm a man.

346
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
I'm a man.

347
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
I'm a man.

348
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,860
I'm a man.

349
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,860
I'm a man.

350
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
I'm a man.

351
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
I'm a man.

352
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,860
I'm a man.

353
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
I'm a man.

354
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
I'm a man.

355
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,860
I'm a man.

356
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860

I'm a man.

358
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
I'm a man.

359
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,860
I'm a man.

360
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
I'm a man.

361
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,860

362
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
I'm a man.

363
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
I'm a man.

364
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm a man.
