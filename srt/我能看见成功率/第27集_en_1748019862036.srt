00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Bai Wu, what a coincidence.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I was originally waiting for this broken stone to fill up the energy.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
After I had the power, I came to pick you up.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I didn't expect that you would come to bring yourself to the door.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Why did you drink the poison?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Guess!

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I've already cleaned up.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How many good things have I done to you?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're not even worth it.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The system...

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The system...

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The system...

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The system...

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Episode 1

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You brat, you dare to fool me?

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Today, I must break your bones into pieces.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wait!

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let go of me. I'll tell you a secret.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What secret?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Aren't these three stars teams out of some of the things?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The system has a thing that has something to do with the Great British Museum.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As long as we combine the two systems,

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and combine the words of the Great British Museum,

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
we'll get a treasure.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What treasure?

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That treasure is...

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
a dead body.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You still want to fool me?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You...

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What's wrong?

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You still have a piece of Fugui?

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not my Fugui.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not my Fugui.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's the real Fugui.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's not Fugui.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Even if you're faking it,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
he's out of energy now.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can't take it for granted.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can't?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll just give him the power.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Tell me how to start.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Go!

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How can I start?

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
brat, you didn't lie to me.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How could I lie to you?

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You dare not?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I didn't expect that you still have the chance to take it.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've heard that the two forces of He Tu Gu Yu are in the same boat.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
With him, it means that you're a god.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You didn't get me, did you?

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Fatty, I'm just trying to get you.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Are you going to blow me up?

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're scaring me.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Li Erloili

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can kick your ass훈.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You wanted to follow our decision?

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,520
I will... I will be equal to the Hall Leader.

61
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,440
No! I will replace him with a new one.

62
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,920
I will become the new Hall Leader of the Divine Palace.

63
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,680
I will become the master of this world!

64
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,960
I'm equipped with that type of weapons.

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,200
какие?

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,040
You can do this.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,520
They are pretty hard to handle.

68
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,280
We have to pay.

69
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,780
Let's begin.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,660
The world in peace

71
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Morning

72
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Come

73
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,700
Shit!

74
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
Bai Wu.

75
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,960
You've passed the flightpoke.

76
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,040
Hello, prepared talent for you guys

77
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,880
a lot.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,920
Mr. Su.

79
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,020
You're too courteous.

80
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,620
I have made up my mind.

81
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,000
If is caught by Shen Donkeyiang,

82
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,660
please let's flinch on him for now.

83
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,960
Take a good rest first.

84
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,320
Once we get back

85
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,360
After the auction,

86
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,400
we'll discuss the next step.

87
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,120
President Sun,

88
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,800
I don't need to go to the auction with this?

89
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,960
No need.

90
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,440
There are so many big things happening in the ancient world.

91
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,840
It's also a human-made thing.

92
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm willing to pay for the auction

93
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,920
of the ancient players of the first group of the national treasure.

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,880
There's no group at all.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,160
President Sun,

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,120
I have a way

97
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,280
to deal with the first group.

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,320
Leave it to me.

99
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,160
Wait, wait.

100
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,680
There's something coming in front of our door.

101
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,720
Is the plaza small?

102
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,460
It's okay.

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,980
It's not our plan.

104
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,760
Then we need to bring a friend to help us.

105
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,660
Who will come to help you?

106
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't tell me you want to help me.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,080
I'm sorry, but you will only like for the president's son.

108
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,320
That's fine. I can open a room for myself.

109
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,120
There is no available room in the hotel at the moment.

110
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,520
Then it's a good one. Let's live together.

111
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
What?

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
You're willing?

113
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm willing.

114
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
I'm willing.

115
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,520
The environment is really good.

116
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,680
The bed is so comfortable.

117
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,520
What are you thinking about? Sleeping sofa?

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Yes, yes.

119
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
The place is so hot.

120
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
What's wrong?

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
You should take a shower first.

122
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Right now?

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Is it inappropriate?

124
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,520
What are you thinking about? Don't make me worry.

125
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,520
There is no CCTV here.

126
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
I'm here.

127
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Bai Wu!

128
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Bai Wu!

129
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm going to beat you to death!

130
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I'm going to beat you to death!
