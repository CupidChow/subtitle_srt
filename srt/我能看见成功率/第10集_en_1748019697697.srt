1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Mr. Che,

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,600
you have 26 ancient items in total.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Right?

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
That means you know how to calculate.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Don't worry.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Listen to me.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,200
This is the Zitan 8-line table in the front building.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,400
The market price is 20 million yuan.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
You have it eight years ago.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
That's right.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,200
This is the first exhibition of the Ming Dynasty's Wanli Academy's Manor.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,400
The market price is 5 million yuan.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
You took it in October last year.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,400
How did you know?

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,400
We've been talking about it for over two years.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,400
So we can figure out the origin of this exhibition.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,400
This is the Mao Bi Jia used by the Qing Dynasty.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,000
You took it in April last year.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Unfortunately, these are the Ming Dynasty's.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The Qing Hua Zi of the Yuan Dynasty,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and the red-nosed Meng,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
are all taken in February this year.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Finally, the yellow-flower-leaf circle of Song Mo

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
can be bought seven years ago.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But the market price is far from the yellow-flower-leaf circle of other markets.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because it is a product,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you have to pay for these four legs.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How is that possible?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Boss Chen, do you think I'll be able to do it this time?

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why?

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Tell me.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is it the Holy Grail Hall that came to pick me up?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Holy Grail Hall?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's not a long time ago.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wait, wait, wait.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I really don't know what Holy Grail Hall is.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Father, you...

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
After all, he is also a friend of the Holy Grail Hall.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's okay.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I just want to have fun with him.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who knows how young people like him

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
can't handle it?

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's have fun.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can't even cut my arm.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Have you asked the lady?

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The Holy Grail is

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
collected on the Ghost City.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ghost City?

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I know.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It seems that it's the first time

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
they've seen this kind of code.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it must be related to the Holy Grail Hall

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that Mr. Che said.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's 100% related to the case.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Mr. Che, what do you mean by the Holy Grail Hall?

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Holy Grail Hall is a ancient and fake company.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's specialized in gold-fishing products.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Those two codes are their symbol.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It seems like this.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But I didn't expect that

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
their current public opinion

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
can even fool the father's eyes.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Little thief, open the price.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is a female painting.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll take it.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, no, Mr. Che.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This painting is my gift to you.

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Give it to him.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's over 10 million.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Mr. Che.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No need to say more.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
10 million.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've already taken your advantage.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's been two thousand days.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Fatty Wang, you're really my lucky dog.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Mr. Che, since the product has been broken,

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll win the bet just now.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You win.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then, what's the hurry for you to promise me?

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I have one more thing to ask you for help.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Please.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Come with me.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's go.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You said you'd recommend the brush, right?

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes, Mr. Liu.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Since you're so good,

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I have a big reward for you.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Please give it to San San.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No problem.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll go get it.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll go get it.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll go get it.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll go get it.

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll go get it.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll go get it.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll go get it.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll go get it.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What I want to get is this famous flower, Xiangyun wine.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's worth 13 million.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
13 million?

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mr. Bai, please take a look.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The last one is the right one.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The flower color, the brush and the attitude

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
are all very reliable.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is a treasure that opens the door.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But I don't know why.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have a sense of dissatisfaction.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I always feel that it's not right.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So I didn't succeed in my job.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Since you can calculate the market price,

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the product,

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
you should be able to calculate the color of this paper.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You mean

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I should be the one to pay 13 million?

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you can calculate the real price,

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll buy it.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll do my best.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The system is usually taken.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why didn't it move today?

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This system only focuses on the questions you asked.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not your personal idea.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay, okay.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You win.

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then ask if this wine paper is real.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The product's rate is 100%.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How to prove it?

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Where is the evidence?

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The steel enemy, the steel master?

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The product's rate is 100% in the steel area.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
In the steel area?

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then how do I get the evidence?

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Can't I break the steel?

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The steel is 100% covered by the evidence.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The steel is 4.24% covered by the evidence.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
4.24%?

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is worth 13 million.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Although I know it's a product,

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
if it's 4%,

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I won't cry.

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If it's covered, there's a risk.

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If it's not covered,

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the car can't be completely trust.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This ancient age

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
is the only clue for my parents.

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How's it going, Xiaozhi?

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Congratulations.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You think this steel is real?

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Congratulations, boss.

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
13 million is left.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
With my recommendation,

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
this steel is fake.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fake?

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You...

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How can you prove it?

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Do you have evidence?

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Evidence?

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's in the steel area.

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In the steel area?

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Then...

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't know if I can break the steel.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Break the steel?

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're kidding me.

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is a ten-million-dollar-tall steel.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're so rude.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can break it if you want.

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Father, he...

174
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This steel hasn't been traded.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not my thing yet.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But the steel is of great importance.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You have to break it

178
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
by the owner's permission.

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then please contact the owner.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll face him.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Boss Zhao.

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Come.

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Boss Zhao,

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it's all done.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Prepare to be traded.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
As long as you're a real steel,

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll buy it.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right, Bai Wu?

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Boss Zhao,

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
this is...

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Boss Zhang,

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm Bai Wu.

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm here to help you build the Jiu Long Steel.

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The steel?

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Xiao Zang,

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
do you know how much I owe you?

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The value is 13 million.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're a total of eight times the price.

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're a fool

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
before he did it.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're a fool?

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you should go back to your old age

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and have some milk.

206
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A Yanpian?

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How much can it be?

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Boss Chen,

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you know that

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've just been in the industry

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and have been working for many companies.

212
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't care if you don't buy it.

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
he has a little boy

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
who's got a white tooth.

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll give him a discount.

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's true or false.

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You can't tell.

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Although it's risky,

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you can't lose.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I want to see

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
how you feel

223
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
when you're broken up

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
by the 13 million steel.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Boss Bai,

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
don't be impulsive.

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Xiao Zang,

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you're a fool.

229
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Why would I

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
give you the value of 13 million?

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Boss Chen,

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
you're so ridiculous.

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I won't sell the steel anymore.

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This guy is so mean.

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He's a fool.

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If you don't listen to me,

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
what kind of person is Zhang Dazhuang?

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How dare you do this to me?

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't care who you are.

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You!

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm not a fool.

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm not a fool.

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not a fool.

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not a fool.

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm not a fool.

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not a fool.

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm not a fool.

252
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm not a fool.

253

I'm not a fool.

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm not a fool.

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000

269

I've been in都市 just can't stop.

270
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I've been in都市 just can't stop.

271
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I've been in not a silly conclusion.

272
