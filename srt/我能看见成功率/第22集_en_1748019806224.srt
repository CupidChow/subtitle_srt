1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,880
Moon choruses

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,720
The first round gives us a Juan Pass

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,920
You locations

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,300
and your names

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,880
Saved by the eight Villa remaining

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,260
You Druid

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,340
Pick the stars

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What's the strategy?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've calculated it.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The budget of Tian's family

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is about 12.1 million.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And we only have 6.1 million.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So I've decided to make two strategies.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The first one is to invest in a piece of paper.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We can definitely standardize the highest price.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But the probability of the capitalization of the prince is only 12%.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The second strategy is to invest in two pieces.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This way, the probability of the capitalization of the prince

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
will be 25%.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If the capitalization is not high,

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the profit will be directly affected.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What do you think?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll make the strategy.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's the taste?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We'll really make three pieces of paper.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't worry.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Prince Yu will definitely make three pieces of paper.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, I'll listen to you.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The first round is over.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nice.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Congratulations, Mr. Tian.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Congratulations.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The second round is still five minutes.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Do we have to add the price this round?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No hurry.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We won't move this round.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But the housekeeper...

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't worry.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
With the power of the housekeeper,

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
he can invest at least two pieces of paper.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Look at the situation.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The first round is still half.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The second round, he can only invest one piece of paper.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So,

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
their target paper is already exposed.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Come on.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you, everyone.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The second round is over.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They chose the eighth.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Very good.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The first and third round are ours.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The third round starts now.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The reality is ten minutes.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's follow the price on the eighth round.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's it.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The dead girl will win this round.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Five hundred.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is the third round really worth it?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's play a few games.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I guess you can make one hundred.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When?

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Just wait and see.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come on.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Change.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Change.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Again.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Change.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Change.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Change.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Change.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Change.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Change.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Change.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Change.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Change.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Nine times in a row.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The old man is so lucky.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm so lucky.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, the last time.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I bet it's not a flower but a word.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not a flower but a word.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What else can it be?

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come on.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You asked me if the third round is a problem.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You see how bad my luck is.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then it's fine.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The third round is over.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Please take the final result.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How is that possible?

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The price of the game is higher than mine.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Congratulations to the fifth round.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The target number is 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Congratulations to the target number.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Miss Muye.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Miss Muye.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The target number is 5, 6.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The target number is 5.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The target number is 5.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This kid.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's hurt his hands.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's the matter?

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
To be frank,

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I got six pairs of the jade scar I made.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is a joke.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're so stupid.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How many are there?

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The meeting is not decided.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can't use the target number.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Tian,

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
do you remember our bet?

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I bet with Miss Muye.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you have any target number?

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I knew you were not right.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The blind date is over.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Next,

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,080
the most popular date in the Japanese

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's weird.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Since we're already busy,

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
why does the target number

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
have to be the target number 5 and 6?

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's see.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Heart of the King

124
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,080
Suheng

125
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Suheng

126
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,000
Suheng

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Suheng

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Suheng

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Suheng

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Suheng

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Suheng

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Now,

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
let's witness the birth of the King of the New World.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The color of clothes is so beautiful.

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But the price in the middle is too high.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Otherwise, it will definitely be the King of the War.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Thank you.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.3 is a face-to-face match.

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But he is too much.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is very good.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No.8 is the best.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The color is clear and the atmosphere is clear.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He is definitely a special guest.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No.8.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It looks like

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No.8 is the king of the year.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's just a little bit.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't be angry, Mr. Tian.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Although they didn't win this little girl,

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
she spent 6 billion on No.5 and No.6.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She must be a loser.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Shut up.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I didn't even open it.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Can you see it in the outside?

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Although these two Yuan are bigger,

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
there is one thing that is busy.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The others are all reliable.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The most bad in 8 yuan.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So,

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
she won't win the water ticket?

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No.8.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm so stupid.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I should be able to come back to this number in the end.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
10 million.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
100 million.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
100 million.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll buy 6 billion and buy 2 million.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll buy 10 million.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mo Yu,

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
your family is done.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's not the end yet.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's too early for you to make a decision now.

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did I come here for nothing?

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll settle this number.

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Shut up.

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
God can't break the promise.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If you say it's wrong,

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't make a mistake.

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What if?

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If these two Yuan can open the net,

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll give you the name of my number.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll withdraw from the imperial court.

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If I can cut off the net,

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll withdraw all the competition.

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Good.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll make a decision.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
