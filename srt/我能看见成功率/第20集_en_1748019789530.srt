Episode 1

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Help me catch him!

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,200
Help me catch him!

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,000
What's going on?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How come I don't know?

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Mr. Qin fell down from the stairs a few days ago.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,000
He was in the middle of the road.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,800
Don't be afraid of his car accident.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,800
The police are looking for his father.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
The car is determined to be safe.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,800
Mr. Qin.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mr. Qin.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,800
How could you be so early?

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,000
Mr. Qin.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
Look at these people.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,000
You were so weak at first.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
Mr. Qin, I'm begging you.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My dad died for the sake of the auction.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You even insulted the auction.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Apologize to my dad.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Apologize.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Apologize.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Apologize.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Apologize.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Apologize.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Apologize.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The money we have found is the money of the Zaojiao Group.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What are you going to do?

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He...

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He is the one who will pay the price.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He will pay the price.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He will do whatever he wants.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why do you want to teach him?

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's the incompetence of this woman.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I will give this useless woman to the organization.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will take the advantage of it.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This useless woman is dead.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
She will live till now.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't blame me for being cruel.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You should be relieved first.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mr. Tang.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is what I told him.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Bai Wu.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Your whole body is being held by me.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How can you fight with me?

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you doing?

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What are you doing?

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What are you doing?

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What are you doing?

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you doing?

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What are you doing?

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What are you doing?

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What are you doing?

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Your image is getting worse.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Give it back.

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
My smart ass,

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hongeking and Qi Overlord

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
have a panic operation.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They have a major proliferation...

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's the new master of tomorrow...

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and the commander of the division.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thus Xiover is Renzi'sทำille.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Since Kaianzang aggressorsut come

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,100
the whole K' knob to whom you want.

72
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,300
His chiefs go unnoticed by master andpox.

73
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Certainly.

74
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm so tired!

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,500
balance

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,820
reasonable

77
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,120
environment

78
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,400
Bai Wu

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,060
All you wanted was to die

80
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,860
How can you fight me?

81
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm now the top

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,640
Grab the opportunity

83
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,920
WOW

84
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,080
The captured fate

85
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,120
Thank you so much

86
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,520
My name is Chen Xiaoxiao

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,000
Huang Xiaoke is the key人

88
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,880
IsMay the national security has been granted

89
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,040
I am exceptional

90
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Look

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
In this way

92
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,920
Wasn't he aěnīng money forever?

93
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,040
I have a method surface

94
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
How do I do that

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,160
The money is in the index

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,840
They borrowed IQS for D quarter

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,040
Give it to him

98
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,240
human

99
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Xitong, tell me.

100
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Is there anyone who can be the one?

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Who is the one?

102
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,200
You've been in the line for several days. Can you make it?

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Do you think I'm useless without you?

104
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm useless again.

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm useless again.

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Xitong. Xitong!

107
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Please let us go.

108
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm useless again.

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Wu Ye, you!

110
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Don't hurt me!

111
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Don't hurt me!

112
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Are you crazy?

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
You're just so stubborn to commit suicide.

114
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
That's right.

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm going to die.

116
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I'm going to die.

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I didn't.

118
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I just cut fruits and cut my hands.

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I understand that you're under pressure.

120
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
You wanted to deal with the people in the auction.

121
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
But they hurt you.

122
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
You're really cruel.

123
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
You're losing money and you're being humiliated.

124
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
You can't find a way to cut your hands.

125
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
You can.

126
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
You'll be safe.

127
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
You really didn't want to commit suicide?

128
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Think about it now.

129
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Wu Ye, go ahead and shave your good health.

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
We'll fight here when you get better.

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Yes, together.

132
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Bai Wu, you were RX-F wowed.

133
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
You're Naz desire.

134
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,920
Forget it.

135
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,120
I give up.

136
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,360
What?

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:50,440
I won't pursue the

138
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,160
road.

139
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,560
Brother Wu, you're sitting like this.

140
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
What's wrong?

141
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,480
I'll help you find Wanbao.

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,680
Help Mr. Che to get the food.

143
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,720
Go to the front of the prison.

144
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
Save the fat.

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,400
Catch the fried rice.

146
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,200
Only God can make the fried rice

147
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
be burned to death.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,160
How can I work hard

149
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,400
to win?

150
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,120
I'm tired.

151
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,840
Can't give up.

152
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,480
The food is from Zizhu's.

153
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,100
I think

154
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,360
we have some water left.

155
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,720
Can it be that

156
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,800
he airport,

157
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,200
Is looking for a man.

158
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,960
You can't see him in the restaurant.

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,680
I've happened to meet top buffals in Chengdu.

160
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,720
Anyway,

161
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:49,720
all theorientals over there

162
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,220
Brother Nu,

163
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,220
I got many balloons,

164
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,520
but I'm afraid that I lose.

165
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,140
Mr. Cheng.

166
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,240
Sit down.

167
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
I don't know.

168
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm just worried...

169
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
I know.

170
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,640
You are afraid that you will never believe

171
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,440
the person around you.

172
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
How do you know?

173
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,640
You are so petty.

174
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
You are in the same situation

175
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,240
as I was 14 years ago.

176
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,040
Did you also...

177
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,640
At that time, I just started to study

178
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,040
the secret of the He Tu Palace.

179
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,840
I was investigating the clues of the Palace of God.

180
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
At that time, someone said that

181
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
this is not the case.

182
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,240
I didn't care.

183
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,040
I was just worried

184
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
that the unfortunate thing would be caused by the middle.

185
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
First, my daughter

186
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
fell down from the stairs and died.

187
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,640
It caused my nephew to die.

188
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,440
My daughter also fell into the path of the path.

189
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,840
It's a pity that I left my son alone.

190
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,040
My research work

191
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,140
stopped.

192
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,740
When I was about to die,

193
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,040
someone found a secret of the He Tu Palace

194
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,240
in the building of Shanshan.

195
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,040
I sent my son to the Palace of God

196
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,540
and drove him there.

197
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,740
I didn't believe that they met a car accident.

198
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,340

203
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,540
Who is the assistant of my son?

204
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,340
He is the one who is the most handsome.

205
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,140
