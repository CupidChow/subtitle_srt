1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first step is to give Miss Dida a chance to teach students.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
The suicide case has been passed on.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,400
After the case is settled, there will be another way to cheat the case.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,800
You have the right to know.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
No.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,200
That's the second step.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Fishing is a law.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The first step is to give Miss Dida a chance to teach students.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The second step is to give Miss Dida a chance to teach students.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,200
No problem.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,000
I have been in the class for three years.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Senior, can I call your WeChat?

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,000
Senior, can I call your WeChat?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Senior, can I call your WeChat?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You can do anything.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The third step is to find a liar.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But there are so many ads.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How can you know which one is a liar?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's easy to say.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Leave this to me.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is it.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is it.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is it.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is it.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is it.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is it.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Next, we need to prepare the earpick.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To show the key performance in the social month,

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
this is the only way to cheat.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's it.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Send it.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Next, we will see if you can cheat.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't worry.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The photo is very simple.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's really very difficult.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello, Miss WeChat.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The number you have dialed is busy.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please call again later.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm downstairs.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fatty is in there.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I have WeChat to call back.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Get ready to go.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hello, I'm here for the interview.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hello, is it Fei Fei?

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Come with me.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is a group that can rest.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The environment of the company is so good.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
By the way, there are swimming pool and massage room downstairs.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There is a guest room upstairs.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So great.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Of course.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We, Meifei Da, are big-scale shopping companies.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The employees' service is in Jiangcheng.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They are all in the first place.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But I don't think there are many people.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please go to the living room.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The space and equipment are all rented.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's better to make a big deal.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's the most troublesome to arrange the staff.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So the interview time will be in the living room.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This room.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They will deliberately block you in the interview later.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And conduct a production of PoA.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Until the end, I will tell you how I want to do my job.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Call the payment to pay my compensation fee.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The show is going to be so exciting.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let the liar think that you are very good at it.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then let's start.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hello.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
My name is Ding Yifei.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hello.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm Luo Jiajun.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The company's business director.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is the director.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ding Yifei, right?

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I have seen your resume.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You have no experience in work at all.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Because I haven't graduated yet.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I believe in my potential.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I...

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You believe in what you have.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What do you want me to believe in?

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's always a start.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't be nervous.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
As a newbie in the workplace,

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
how do you think about the difficulties and challenges you encounter in work?

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The difficulties and challenges.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will find the key to the problem.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Help the initiative.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Please call the colleague and the leader.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let the colleague help you solve everything.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What do you want from the company?

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
waste time.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This kind of person is also here to interview.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Who wants to be the director?

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I arranged it.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's wrong?

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't worry.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One sings red and one sings white.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Director Luo,

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
we need someone who can be reliable and stable and complete the job.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because of the ability of one person,

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
he lacks experience in work.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You just deny it.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We will lack a lot of potential.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You are right.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Do you want to be the director?

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You think everyone is like you?

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's wrong with you?

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why are you talking to me?

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You try to be a bit more relaxed.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't make a mess.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Director Luo.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They will definitely recommend you to participate in training.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You will pretend to be the director when you are there.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That interview is over.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How can I inform you?

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No need.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This kind of place is not suitable for you.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
How could it be?

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I feel like I did nothing wrong.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Bai Wu, what's going on?

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I shouldn't have.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Forget it.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll be back.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Li Yifei.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sorry.

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The interview was over.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I should have apologized.

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I was the one who caused you to quarrel with your colleague.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I am no longer your colleague.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have resigned.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You have resigned?

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is it because of me?

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't be so guilty.

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I have long disappointed this company.

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's better not to hear it because of me.

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If it's because of me,

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I am so sorry.

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The shareholders of the company will follow me.

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I will start my own business.

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I believe that I can't use them for two years.

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will surpass them.

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You are so good.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Add a WeChat.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We can work together.

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay.

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Good job.

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Where are you going?

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
To school.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
To the school, right?

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll send you off.

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I won't bother you.

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No.

160
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I know.

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You are afraid of your boyfriend, right?

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No.

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No problem.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's go.

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This little girl.

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She is good.

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will watch a movie tomorrow.

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But I have a class tomorrow.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Just be my client who suddenly lost his job.

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay.

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
See you tomorrow.

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
See you tomorrow.

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
See you.

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Bye.

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why do you have to finish it in such a long time?

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Sorry.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's okay.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Are you ready to work?

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Come to my company.

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I ordered a tea for the staff.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I also made it.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I especially understand their hard work.

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is it good luck to have a boss like you?

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You are the most special girl I have ever seen.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are the most special girl I have ever seen.

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Are you saying this to many girls?

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
How is that possible?

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I found that you are a little strange today.

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You are so cute.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Zi Zi.

194
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Here.

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is not good.

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is a little one.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I want a big one.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I will buy it in the other room.

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I will buy it for you.

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So beautiful.

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's okay.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Wu Yin.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's been eight days.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When will you be a boss?

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Today.

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That guy will be a hundred percent of you.

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A 500-year-old girl?

208
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How can she be like a girl?

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What is this trick?

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
How dare you cheat?

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sorry.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You know how romantic it is.

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You are so handsome.

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You are so gentle and talented.

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You are perfect.

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You think you are a newbie.

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You are so beautiful.

218
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You are so beautiful.

219
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How do you guess?

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Of course.

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wait.

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I...

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I am not ready yet.

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's okay.

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Relax.

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We will be a good couple.

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If girls refuse,

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the liar will take the pills.

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And the rice will be cooked.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Of course.

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Filming equipment is not necessary.

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Most girls

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
will be concerned about

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the relationship between the two men.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They will be defensive.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And this is the best time

237
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
to cheat.

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Next,

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
he will...

240
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I suddenly lost my cash.

241
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I owe a lot of money.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They won't let me go.

243
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't be like this.

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
How much money did you owe?

245
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Two million.

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Two million?

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Fei Fei,

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
can you help me?

249
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
How can I help you?

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Help me with the money.

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I will pay it back

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
when I get the money.

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Fei Fei, help me.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Or they will kill me.

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
In this step,

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
girls are only

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the share of the money.

258
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
My god.

259
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's so horrible.

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What should I do?

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I will pay the price.

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Cheers.

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Fei Fei,

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
open it.

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What is this?

266
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's for you.

267
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's so beautiful.

268
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Fei Fei,

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I like you.

270
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Be my girlfriend.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's late.

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you go back late,

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you will close the door.

274
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Tomorrow is weekend.

275
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't go back to school today.

276
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Go to my house.

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Wait.

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I...

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm not ready yet.

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's okay.

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Relax.

282
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We will be the guests.

283
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Tomorrow.

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Tomorrow.

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What are you going to do?

286
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Tomorrow is the bookshop.

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I will accompany you.

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't.

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No.

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't do this.

291
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No.

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Go.

293
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Go.
