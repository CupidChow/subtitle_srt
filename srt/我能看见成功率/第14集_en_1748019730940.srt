1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
flip

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,400
I thought my mother would die

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,400
But almost everyone of you came to interview me

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,240
I recommend several people in theилитесь Jedi

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,440
President Sun said he would test you.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
He is the entrance examiner.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,640
President Sun,

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,040
the products are all from the market.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,040
Did we find any clues in the meeting?

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
The clues were locked up a few minutes ago.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,040
I arranged a search and found out that they were secretly looking for the burn.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,040
But they disappeared a while ago.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,640
The clues are broken.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
They disappeared.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
They disappeared.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,040
They disappeared.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,040
They disappeared.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
My brothers.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,040
It's not easy to arrange an entrance exam in advance.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,040
What is the origin of this神 palace hall?

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,040
The ancient ring is in the Qing Dynasty.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
Two very powerful generals appeared.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,440
The defense products they made were called Ghost Residence and the Divine Palace.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,440
The Divine Palace Hall was built in Qing Mo.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,440
Later, the Divine Palace Hall made a large batch of antique.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,440
It was very rich.

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,640
Later, after the founding of the new empire,

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,440
under the government's order,

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,840
a group of antique masters formed an antique association.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,440
They joined hands with the products on the market.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,840
The Divine Palace Hall was gradually disappearing.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,240
But in recent years, they have been busy again.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,440
And this time, the defense products they made are enough to hide the truth.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,840
What do you mean by hiding the truth?

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
What's the point of telling the truth?

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,440
Mr. Che is right.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
What are we going to do next?

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Don't worry.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,240
Today, we will meet.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,840
We will hold an entrance meeting tomorrow.

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,240
Great!

43
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
I will be the first to meet you.

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,240
I will be the first to meet you in Guanjing.

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
I will be the first to meet you in Guanjing.

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,240
You are so beautiful.

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
You are all secret agents.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
You can't talk to anyone.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,240
Are you talking about the underground ghost?

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Yes, it is the underground ghost.

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,640
Or how can we investigate it secretly?

52
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,240
I don't want to meet you.

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Bai Wu.

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Bai Wu.

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,240
I promised you once.

56
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,640
I will tell you about your parents' trap.

57
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
I can tell you today.

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,040
Please tell me.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
Your name is He Tu Gu Yu.

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
He Tu Gu Yu?

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,040
It is said that this jade has two pieces.

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,040
It is a legend from the ancient times.

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
It is a mysterious jade.

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Is it a system?

65
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,440
Back then, the ghost and the god were all different.

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Your jade was in my student's hand.

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Your student?

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Where is he now?

69
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,040
20 years ago, he was in a research institute.

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
He used to send me a message secretly.

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,240
This is it.

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,040
Later, the explosion happened here.

73
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,040
Everyone was confused.

74
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,840
What?

75
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
But you can be sure that your mother's death

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
is related to the god's jade.

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,440
The god's jade?

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Mr. Physician.

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Hello.

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,040
My name is Xia Shi Xia.

81
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,640
What's the name of that gentleman?

82
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,040
I can only speak into words,

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
and I can't wish for it.

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
Jiang Xiao Yu,

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,440
your dad will also be the surprising natural candy.

86
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,920
My mom homogeneous body.

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
Your dad's car.

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
What happened to his sex?

89
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Why is it in my car?

90
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,240
To damage himself.

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,560
Thank you, Mr. Fatty.

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,640
I can do it.

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,480
I hope Mr. Fatty

94
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
won't be famous

95
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,880
by Gu Anxi so soon.

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,880
No.

97
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,200
Why are you so impatient

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,600
when you're here?

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Grandpa said

100
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Mr. Fatty

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
is the most popular in Gu Anxi.

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,520
Who is it?

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,760
Eat.

104
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,760
Why are you here?

105
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,800
Welcome.

106
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,240
Welcome.

107
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,560
Welcome.

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,000
Please.

109
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,040
Miss Yida.

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
This is...

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,720
Mo Yier.

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
She's so pretty.

113
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
She's dead.

114
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
She's been beaten up by you.

115
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,120
I said she's a liar.

116
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,360
She doesn't believe me.

117
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,680
It's hard to explain to me.

118
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,000
I thought you've found a target.

119
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,640
Don't be ridiculous.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
Xiaoyou and I are nothing.

121
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,440
But you're so popular.

122
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,240
You're so popular.

123
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,240
Are you done?

124
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,800
Are you done?

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,080
Are you done?

126
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
You're so dirty.

128
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,080
You're so dirty.

129
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,600
We're playing around.

130
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
Why don't you play with others?

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,080
You should play with you.

132
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,840
Bai Wu.

133
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,040
Is this the Qingqing you told me?

134
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,840
Yes.

135
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,440
Qingqing.

136
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,040
You're so pretty.

137
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,240
I like you so much.

138
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,920
Don't get me wrong.

139
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,360
We're really playing around.

140
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
Come on.

141
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,880
Why are kids playing around?

142
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
I don't have a brother or sister.

143
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,120
I'll treat Bai Wu as my brother.

144
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,960
Let's eat together.

145
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,040
Come on.

146
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Qingqing.

147
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,640
Miss Mo.

148
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,880
I'll get you two chopsticks.

149
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,560
Wait for me.

150
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,280
Wait for me.

151
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,160
Then...

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
Then...

153
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,760
Please.

154
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,320
Then...

155
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,760
Where should I sit?

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Qingqing.

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,160
Don't be so mean.

158
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
You're so shameless.

159
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,200
I...

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Can I come in?

161
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,800
I...

162
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
I told you to come in.

163
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,640
I told you to come in.

164
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,480
Bai Wu.

165
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,760
This house belongs to you.

166
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,240
Let's have a talk, okay?

167
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,800
Just talk here.

168
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,040
Okay.

169
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,760
Bai Wu.

170
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,040
I regret it.

171
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,640
After we broke up,

172
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,880
I've been thinking about you every day.

173
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,520
Let's get along, okay?

174
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,200
Didn't you have a boyfriend?

175
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm sorry, Bai Wu.

176
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,560
I was a liar after I saved him.

177
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,480
He didn't just lie to me.

178
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,960
He hit me.

179
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,280
He even asked me to help him.

180
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
The guests I accompanied him.

181
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,920
Bai Wu, I was wrong.

182
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,880
I regretted it so much that I didn't listen to you.

183
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,360
Let's have a talk next time.

184
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
Please forgive me, okay?

185
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Bai Wu.

186
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,880
It's not easy to be a man.

187
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,240
It's impossible.

188
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,360
I don't want to be a man.

189
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,160
Are you crazy?

190
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,960
I know.

191
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,840
You must love me, right?

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll stay here tonight.

193
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,360
Can I?

194
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
From the source,

195
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,080
therones can't operate

196
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,600
the labCause of the surrounding pit.

197
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,960
Maybe it's not too good.

198
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,600
Tonight,

199
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,160
we're going to stay here and let the guy who's in the room stop here.

200
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,960
Who are you?

201
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,560
He's a partner I'm looking for.

202
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,260
You like Bai Wu?

203
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,360
How could?

204
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,760
Why not?

205
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,680
For years,

206
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,280
he has always been partial to me.

207
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,800
He can't like others.

208
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Who hasn't been a young man who has a mousetrap?

209
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,800
We used to be young and young, but we don't know how to act.

210
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Now we're blind.

211
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Since you're still pursuing, you're not a girlfriend.

212
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
I believe Bai Wu will definitely be with me.

213
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
After all, you don't have anything I have.

214
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
What?

215
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
You're so funny, Big Sis.

216
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
What...what about you?

217
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
He used to treat you like a dead man.

218
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
But you used a wolf's heart to report to him.

219
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
You didn't care about him when he was nice to you.

220
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,440
That guy is so handsome.

221
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,440
He's thinking of his own good.

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
He's even wearing a face mask.

223
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,160
Why?

224
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,800
He's like a turtle.

225
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
Shut up!

226
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,960
What?

227
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,360
To be honest,

228
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
you're so mean.

229
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,560
In this world,

230
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,960
men who are like Bai Wu

231
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,360
are the best men in the world.

232
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,000
Bai Wu,

233
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
it's not like that.

234
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,600
I...

235
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,160
Be quiet.

236
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,400
Throw it away.

237
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,720
What are you doing?

238
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,440
Go away.

239
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,600
Bai Wu.

240
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,560
Bai Wu.

241
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
Bai Wu.

242
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,360
Thank you.

243
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,920
Bai Wu,

244
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,920
you used to be so handsome.

245
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,640
You're so handsome.

246
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,360
Thank you.

247
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
I can't even look at my lips.

248
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,000
That's not how I tie my hair.

249
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,260
He sounded like a monkey who compat�던

250
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,440
and bought everything for you.

251
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,360
He evenrapped all of yours.

252
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,720
How could you?

253
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
Look for켜 на�� тебе,

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,700
He didn't offer it for you last year.

255
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,360
I had no hands in thatition.

256
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,880
When will he forgive you?

257
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,880
I promise.

258
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,640
Please enjoy yourself.

259
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,480
What's so funny?

260
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm not afraid of you.

261
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
I'm not afraid of you.

262
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
I'm not afraid of you.

263
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
I'm not afraid of you.

264
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
I'm not afraid of you.

265
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
I'm not afraid of you.

266
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
I'm not afraid of you.

267
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
I'm not afraid of you.

268
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
I'm not afraid of you.

269
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm not afraid of you.

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm not afraid of you.

271
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
I'm not afraid of you.

272
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
I'm not afraid of you.

273
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm not afraid of you.

274
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,120
Golden capacus of honor,

275
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
The glitteringなんだ became a teenager,

276
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,480
and I see the success.

277
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,440
I carry mountains and rivers and hear the brothers sing,

278
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,020
dadi

279
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,280
assembled,

280
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,940
eyes locked

281
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,740
dadi

282
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,860
Among 듯 and such

283
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,180
The guards reached the beginning of the hertz,

284
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,640
and walked towards it

285
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,740
Today, I will tell you from the world,

286
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,940
Neither one but one

288
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,940
Followed by an unprecedented gift,

They are excellent

291
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,380
At another,

292
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,080
