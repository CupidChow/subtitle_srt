1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
There are still invitations for the People's Republic and Seventh Symphony Eso

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,160
Mr. Aiwu, I'm my righteousness

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,400
To inform you why and why

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,060
You have changed your attitude

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,780
When will change it?

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,000
For today, May 24th

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,040
SOGOT А

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,480
Xitong,

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,440
are you awake?

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,840
Get up and work.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
These treasures are in the sea.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
They've been left for nearly a century.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,760
They're finally going home.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
All the goods.

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,600
What?

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,560
What's going on?

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,880
We're framed.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
You framed us?

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,640
They can't understand.

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,560
Who did this?

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,000
Who else?

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,880
Shen Gongtang?

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,600
They set up the White Tiger Hall here.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,800
And we

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,360
became the spirit of the Wuru Hall.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,040
Miss Beihu and Miss Di,

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,320
I need a reasonable explanation.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,440
If you have any questions,

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,880
please let us know.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,280
Miss, Matthew,

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,680
please check this out.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,320
What's going on?

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
I don't know.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,600
Someone told me to close the door.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
I'll get ready early.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Or you'll be locked up.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
Take him down.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,240
I understand them all.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000
This is misunderstanding.

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
You and Miss Imperial are the victims.

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,600
What does he mean?

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,680
He says they were all misunderstandings.

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,580
Please give me

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,040
a reasonable explanation on中国 Shareholder.

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
What do you explain?

47
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,960
I mean

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,280
Our auction stock

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,940
is all

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
What? How can it be?

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
I'm the second-class horse in the lab.

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,600
This is the second-class horse I found from the lab.

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Something's wrong.

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Wait a minute.

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Give me a big one.

56
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Something's wrong.

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
This isn't the second-class horse in the lab.

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
What?

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
It's really different.

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
It's really different.

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
The Ghost Mansion?

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Ghost Mansion?

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Ghost Mansion?

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
It was called Ghost Mansion in the North of Mount Tai,

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
which was built by the Ghost Mansion

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
200 years ago.

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I didn't expect that you could see this mark

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
today.

69
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I didn't expect that this mark

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
would be left to the outside world.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
And it was also made of smoke.

72
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
No wonder we couldn't find the progress

73
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
of the investigation.

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
It's wrong.

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I'll inform the GIE

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
to start the investigation from the Ghost Mansion

77
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
and find the treasure as soon as possible.

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Thank you.

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Be safe.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
You also found the Ghost Mansion?

81
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
You know the Ghost Mansion?

82
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
To tell the truth,

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
this year I had been a mysterious guy

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
who was competing with me.

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
So I started the investigation privately.

86
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Finally, I found that these people

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
are from the same force,

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Guifu.

89
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Do you mean Guifu

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
has always been a rival?

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes, later.

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
As I found,

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
as long as the Chinese antique

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
are presenting in the market,

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
the people would arrange to sell.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
So, as to take out some

97
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
baby as a bit,

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
the Guifu will hook.

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
As you said,

100
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
we have announced a auction to be held.

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
There are more than 20 VIPs

102
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
and they have been bought by the business.

103
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
How is it?

104
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
It's a deal.

105
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Hello, Mr. Wu De.

106
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I am...

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Mr. Bai Wu.

108
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Sorry,

109
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I don't know you are a woman.

110
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
The teacher asked me to change the subject.

111
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
He is not interested in your shares.

112
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
If you want to meet the teacher,

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
come to the place I called the materials.

114
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
What you said is...

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Are you Mr. Wu De?

116
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Are you Mr. Bai Wu?

117
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Mr. Wu De is a teacher's name.

118
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
My name is Ma Li.

119
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Hello.

120
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
The teacher is waiting for you inside.

121
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Please.

122
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Sorry,

123
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Mr. Bai is only allowed in.

124
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
How can it be?

125
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
There is danger outside.

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Exactly.

127
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Half of our team has always been in the same place.

128
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Get out of the way.

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Mr. Wu.

130
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
I said,

131
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Mr. Bai is only allowed in.

132
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Too anxious.

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Mr. W잉.

134
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,080
Okay

135
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,920
I will go

136
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,920
How many equality points I took for coil gun

137
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
This is

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
Well

139
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,440
Two

140
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,680
Eat

141
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,200
You eat

142
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,480
I eat

143
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,200
The He Tu Gu Yu is a secret.

144
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,880
But you're the previous one.

145
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,440
I am.

146
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,320
You didn't show up

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
even before the late night.

148
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,080
And you even made a spell.

149
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,360
What do you mean?

150
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,120
This is not my spell.

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,720
It's He Tu Gu Yu

152
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,960
who prepared it for me.

153
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,800
Xitou, you're awake.

154
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
Congratulations, Master.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,560
You won He Tu Gu Yu.

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
He Tu Gu Yu

157
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
can achieve a dream

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
that is impossible to achieve in the real world.

159
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,200
Please give me your wish.

160
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,520
You want to fulfill your wish, right?

161
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,800
Then give me a hundred million dollars.

162
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,600
This wish can be achieved in real life.

163
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,360
Please think about it.

164
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,000
I want my parents to be alive.

165
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,200
Awu.

166
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
Awu.

167
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,880
I miss you so much.

168
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,200
Dad.

169
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,160
Mom.

170
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,680
The father, the master, the father,

171
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,480
the son of the emperor,

172
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
and the son of the emperor,

173
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
are all lucky.

174
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,120
What?

175
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,440
Please choose the emperor or the prince.

176
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,040
Enough.

177
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Don't play with this boring trick.

178
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,520
I'm talking about the father.

179
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
This is He Tu Gu Yu's

180
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,320
wish.

181
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,640
I'm afraid I'll be late.

182
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
What wish?

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,920
Why?

184
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,360
Wish.

185
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
Wish.

186
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,280
Of course, it's your wish.

187
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,640
Your wish.

188
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
He Tu Gu Yu

189
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,280
will really achieve your wish.

190
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,600
What?

191
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,320
Likewise,

192
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,640
your friends in the real world

193
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,960
will really die.

194
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Listen.

195
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
If there's any mistake in the martial arts,

196
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,760
I can't spare you.

197
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
You're his friends.

198
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,240
Yes.

199
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Life and death.

200
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Yes.

201
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
Life and death.

202
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,440
Very good.

203
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
You two

204
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
have a man today

205
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
who will die for him.

206
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,120
What do you mean?

207
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,360
What do you mean?

208
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Mu Da Ran.

209
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,720
Let me do it.

210
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,760
Where is Wanyan?

211
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,480
Where is she?

212
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
I want to theme him.

213
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,320
You gave assume half anCouldia.

214
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,780
You also gave give half a rogue Caninda.

215
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,680
Let me do it.

216
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,800
Don't do it.

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,240
Come on.

218
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Who are you going to die with today?

219
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
Let's wait for him to stay in La השine

220
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,840
and let out a call for trust.

221
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,920
The only chance for the Chief of the Prefectural Bureau to do so is this.

222
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,240
Awu!

223
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,560
Awu!

224
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,480
I miss you so much!

225
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
Dad.

226
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,400
I miss you so much.

227
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,240
I really miss you so much.

228
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
Why?

229
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,240
Why did you force me?

230
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,080
The secret is also the first person to make a choice.

231
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,080
I chose to limit myself to live in the world.

232
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,080
To let Fatty calm down and be safe.

233
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Chief of Prefectural Bureau,

234
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,080
this is not the choice of the system.

235
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Is it the Prefectural Bureau?

236
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
In my heart,

237
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,080
this is the only choice.

238
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
As you wish.

239
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Now my ears are like a mouse.

240
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,080
I walk forward and smile with some touch.

241
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,080
But the price is the kindness in my heart.

242
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Lost my precious treasure.

243
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Waiting for the chance to enter it and walk on it.

244
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,080
The golden hands of the purest gold.

245
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,080
I want to break the secret and break the window.

246
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
The treasure of the rich and the poor.

247
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
The golden spirit is the ultimate weapon.

248
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
I see the success in my youth.

249
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
I am a man.

250
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Dad, you are so brave.

251
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Dad, you are so brave.

252
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
The name is the song of the leader.

253
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
The song of the leader.

254
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
The purest gold and the red.

255
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,080
The blood is the blood that I can't control.

256
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,080
The glory of the country.

257
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,080
The golden hands of the purest gold and the red.

258
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,080
The golden hands of the purest gold and the red.

259
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Dad, you are so brave.

260
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
The name is the song of the leader.

261
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,080
The song of the leader.

262
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,080
The song of the leader.

263
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,080
The face is the face of the country.

264
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,080
I see the success in my youth.

265
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,080
The golden hands of the purest gold and the red.

266
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,080
The golden hands of the purest gold and the red.

267
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,080
The pride of the war can always be found.
