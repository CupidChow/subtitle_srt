1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Who is it?

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,040
Who is on the list?

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,060
Lu, sorry.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,940
Here, have money.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,340
Lu, don't run.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,000
What's that?

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,960
What's all this?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,960
Residence updates?

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,500
Even if someone notices...

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,800
She is suspicious.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,840
She is really suspicious.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,840
This is not dead yet.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
This is not dead yet.

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
This is a trap.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
It's so dirty.

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
It's not dead yet.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
The car is broken.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,840
This is so bad.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
What is this?

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
This is not dead yet.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
This is not dead yet.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
This is not dead yet.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Is it okay?

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Is it okay?

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,840
The protection function is activated.

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm still painting.

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
The speed is 100%

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,840
The skin is 2%

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
The internal is 0%

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
The back is 100%

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
You still have the protection function?

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,840
The protection function will only be activated in the emergency situation.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Is it a passive?

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
This box of antiques will definitely

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,840
protect your box of antiques.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
The car suddenly fell down.

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
This is not an accident.

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
The human body is 100%

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
The human body?

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Is it related to the front of the safe?

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Or to the Jiu Long Gang?

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
The Jiu Long Gang is 100% related to the Jiu Long Gang.

43
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
It seems that I broke the property of the Zao Jia Group.

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
They are watching me.

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
I can't hide from this.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Mr. Che, I'm Bai Wu.

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Last time you asked me to investigate the origin of the product.

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,840
I thought it through.

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
That guy is really a big man.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,840
You even hit the car head.

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
I can't die.

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
I'll think of a way to let him die.

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Do you understand? Let him die.

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Boss, I'm the team leader.

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Boss, come here.

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Look at me.

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
It's your new car.

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Boss, look at me.

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
This is really a good thing.

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
After Mr. Che agreed to try it,

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
he introduced us to the Jiu Long Gang Association.

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
You're lying to me.

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Great.

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
As long as we enter the association,

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll be fair.

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
It's just an introduction.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
It's so exaggerated.

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Of course.

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
As long as we enter the association,

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
we can get the back book.

71
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I can open a shop

72
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
that belongs to my own shop.

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Okay.

74
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
I've made up my mind for you.

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Uncle,

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
half of the month.

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Good name.

78
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Master Wu,

79
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
I'll give you and Miss Dida

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
the shares of each city.

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
How about it?

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Okay, we'll talk about it later.

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Let's find Bao Da first.

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Bao Da?

85
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm too young.

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I'll contact him in China.

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
I'll call him first.

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
You're blind.

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
You can't see it.

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Fatty.

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
What's this?

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
A box of gold?

93
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
What's this?

94
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Let's try it.

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Maybe Bao Da asked us about it.

96
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I'll take it.

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Let me do it.

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,400
It's an activity that wasゲ

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,840
See?

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,680
theyAll collided and the VIP theater apparently полез delicious

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:53,660
There is only one candidate who will be the second

102
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,100
Oh,

103
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,100
Wu Yan,

104
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,100
you really taught me this thing.

105
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,740
Let's do it.

106
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,580
Why are there figures?

107
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,940
Personal photo,

108
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,500
drawn on the outside as if their eyes are asked to wash their face.

109
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
They don't也是 instruction manual antics.

110
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,460
What shall we do now?

111
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,740
Go.

112
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,500
Qu Geng,

113
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,340
change your clothes.

114
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,180
Fine.

115
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,820
Master Mar 뒤에.

116
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,500
You've been here.

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,380
What about those guys?

118
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,740
Why are they現實流行大家?

119
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,180
You're joking.

120
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
This person is not a informant.

121
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Where is the informant?

122
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,180
No.

123
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,180
We are the most important people in the company.

124
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,180
I also know that

125
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,180
I want to test you.

126
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,180
You want to test me?

127
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Please.

128
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,180
This is the case.

129
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,180
I just ran from the office.

130
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,180
You can't see the team.

131
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
They are still fighting.

132
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,180
No problem.

133
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,180
Mr. Wu, are you too nervous?

134
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,180
I'm nervous.

135
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,180
This is a small matter. Let me do it.

136
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
Let me do it.

137
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
This is the bamboo stage of Spring and Autumn.

138
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,180
As long as you put it in any museum,

139
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,180
it's a treasure of the town.

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Wu, what do you think?

141
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,180
The sample.

142
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
It should be from ten years ago.

143
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,180
Although the method is high-end,

144
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,180
the embroidery time is long, so it will be exposed.

145
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,180
The sample?

146
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
It can't be.

147
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
It's wrong.

148
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,180
The most expensive material in the company is five thousand.

149
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
The situation is too low.

150
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
It's so hard.

151
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
If you are angry, you can't tell us what the sample is.

152
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
What should we do?

153
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,180
There are ten people, ten horses, ten horses.

154
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,180
They are playing tricks.

155
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,180
Let's look at this.

156
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,180
The book of the rice dress.

157
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
The sample.

158
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
Although it's from the old paper in the north,

159
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
it's new this year.

160
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,180
It costs thirty thousand.

161
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
It's a pity.

162
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,180
It's a good paper.

163
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
But it's not worth it.

164
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,180
Wu, these two are all samples.

165
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,180
Did you see it wrong?

166
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,180
The magic wolf, Caiyu and Hu Shunping are also samples.

167
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Wu, I think it's not a disease.

168
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
The biggest problem is the beauty disease.

169
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,180
Mr. Bai, please think about it.

170
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Please look at the slide.

171
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,180
The red and red of the red-haired man in the Qingfu City.

172
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,180
This is the design of the Qianlong Emperor's own trial.

173
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,180
It was picked out in the top ten items of Jingde Town.

174
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,180
The rest is a waste of money.

175
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,180
It's a waste of money.

176
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,180
Waste of money?

177
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
It's more valuable.

178
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
What's the problem?

179
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,180
The sample has been collected by the country.

180
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
It's on the national exhibition.

181
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
What's the problem?

182
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,180
Wu, you mean these three are...

183
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,180
The sample.

184
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,180
And I'm sure that

185
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,180
there must be two horses in the magic cave.

186
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,180
Do you know that the two horses are useful?

187
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,180
I don't know.

188
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
I used my phone to sweep it.

189
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,180
I couldn't find it.

190
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,180
Use your method of collecting the red-haired man.

191
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,900
What a suspicious place.

192
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,180
Xuanong?

193
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,140
Wu Ye, be careful!

194
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,300
Let's go, Fatty.

195
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,100
Let's go.

196
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,780
Yes.

197
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,180
Xidao, give me a chance.

198
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,620
The success rate of the exam is 26%.

199
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,340
How can you be so low?

200
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,620
I didn't want to leave my uncle.

201
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,940
But I really love money.

202
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,940
I'll give you a chance.

203
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,540
What?

204
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,620
If Shen Genghao

205
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,300
allows me to rule the country,

206
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,220
I'll be the leader.

207
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,620
Don't worry.

208
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,860
I won't be the leader of Shen Genghao.

209
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,620
The leader of the industry

210
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,820
is a violent industry.

211
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,260
The market is more profitable than the real industry.

212
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,260
Either we make money together

213
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,580
or we die together.

214
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
Fatty, what do you think?

215
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,620
Wang Fatty is greedy and good-for-nothing.

216
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,460
But he's famous in Guanjie.

217
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,380
He's a sick person.

218
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,860
I chose him for money.

219
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,860
I think it's reasonable.

220
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,180
But old Huacheng said

221
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,700
he's not good at making decisions.

222
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,180
I didn't expect that

223
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,100
I would go with him one day.

224
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,260
Then you'll die.

225
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,020
He's not alive.

226
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,380
He's alive.

227
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,540
He's not alive!

228
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,380
He's alive!

229
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,660
Go!

230
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:35,760
Come.

231
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,820
No!

232
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,580
I know

233
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,220
you're from the Diviners'ium.

234
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:48,800
Can you

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,420
follow me

236
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,860
on thisべus?

237
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,220
It's not the problem of run here

238
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,620
but what他们 do.

239
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,220
As long as I help them with Dongdeng He.

240
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,300
He's an excellent leader.

241
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,680
values are raised above all it comes out

242
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Wh Intellect

243

It's even a man

246
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,020
You're right

247
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,840
