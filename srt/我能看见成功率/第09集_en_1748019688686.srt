1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Tongguo

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,500
Tang Boxu's escaped its first culinary show

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,060
Wasing

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,560
For real?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,780
Your behalf

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,080
Dece Wave

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,900
To all you employees

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,600
Based on your account

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,840
This guy

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,080
My hands are running dry

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
I might as well go.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Sun BilÃ¼ has taken you by surprise.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,200
Are you okay?

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,080
You shouldn't give me your taste buds.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,400
I shouldn't have told you if you gave them to Tianxin.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,600
You really take me in, even if I heard shit of what you want from Ar sabemos

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,400
I swear I won't be married to never be a human again.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,800
Wh..Why though?

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,400
If he really believes you, you'll believe him.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,000
What if it's a fake?

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,400
No need to use a person to be suspicious.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,800
Moreover, Bai Wu is not stupid.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,800
He can't even get a sample to lie to his boss.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,800
I dare to bet that Bai Wu

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
won't be able to ride a car.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I bet he can.

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,800
You're just brainwashed by that stinky garlic!

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I'm not a fool.

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I'm just a fool.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I'm just a fool.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm just a fool.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm just a fool.

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I'm just a fool.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm just a fool.

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm just a fool.

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I'm just a fool.

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm just a fool.

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm just a fool.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm just a fool.

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
I'm just a fool.

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm just a fool.

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Hello, I'm Bai Wu.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
You're Mr. Bai?

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
This is 30,000.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
I'm glad to help Xiao Xiao to take care of Aoyao.

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
No need.

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I just want to meet Mr. Che.

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Here, take it.

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Sorry, I'm a bit busy.

50
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm just a little bit busy.

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I just want to ask Mr. Che

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
about the stuff about the antique shop.

53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Father just finished practicing.

54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Don't talk about it.

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Just wait and see what he does.

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
I'll go to the tea.

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm Bai Wu.

58
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
He's Xiao Xiao's friend.

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
I've been here for a long time.

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm here to say goodbye.

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Thank you, Mr. Che.

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
You can sit down.

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
You can sit down.

64
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Father, Xiao Xiao is angry.

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Why are you hitting me?

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
What's wrong with you?

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Father just wants to know about Xiao Xiao.

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
You... You did it first.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
He just got angry.

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
It's obvious.

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Father.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
You're a brat.

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
No matter if you're Bai Wu or Hei Wu,

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
stay away from my granddaughter

75
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
and keep harassing Xiao Xiao.

76
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I'll break your leg.

77
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
No.

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Just keep doing it.

79
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Sorry, Mr. Che.

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I've found the place.

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I'll do it right away.

82
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Don't praise me like that.

83
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm the one who disturbed Xiao Xiao.

84
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Why did you hit me?

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Who praised you?

86
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Father said,

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
you brat,

88
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
you dare to say that

89
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I have a secret weapon in my stock.

90
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
If you can't get the evidence,

91
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
you'll be expelled from the stock market.

92
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
A big piece of paper?

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
So many information.

94
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Yes.

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Do you understand human language?

96
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
I'll break the evidence first.

97
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
My grandfather's character

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
is a little weird.

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
A little?

100
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Okay.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Mr. Bai, don't be nervous.

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
If you have any evidence,

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
you can take it out.

104
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
I heard that

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
there's a girl in Tangbo Lake

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
who was a student of the Tang Dynasty.

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I was lucky to have her.

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I got a copy.

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Please take it out.

110
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
The entrance is old,

111
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
the pen is old,

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
and the fortune is unique.

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
It's really Tangyin's true skill.

114
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
What's wrong?

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
You see it?

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
What do you mean?

117
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
These two paintings are exactly the same.

118
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
The return of the past nine years

119
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
and the cruelness are the same.

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
In this world,

121
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
there can't be two completely the same paintings.

122
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
If there is,

123
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
the seven-dimensional sword must be the same.

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Did I say something wrong again?

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
My god, this master is so scary.

127
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Qi Tao, please help me.

128
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
The task is too simple.

129
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
The system refused to help.

130
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Father is praising you.

131
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
You're smart.

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Come on, get up.

133
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
These two paintings are exactly the same.

134
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
They are so brilliant.

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
It's really hard to distinguish.

136
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
But Mr. Bai,

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
how do you know that

138
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm not good at picking up?

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
It must be a Yan Pin.

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Father said that the stinky kid

141
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
dared to lie.

142
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I'll kick you out of the house.

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
I'd like to bet with the car.

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
How do you want to bet?

145
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
If I'm wrong,

146
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
I'd like to take out one million and apologize to the car.

147
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
If I win,

148
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
I hope the car can promise me three small things.

149
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Well...

150
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Okay.

151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
As you say.

152
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
The Yan Pin is so serious.

154
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
It's hard to tell the truth.

155
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
The Yan Pin is 100% correct.

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
But there's a Yan Pin's evidence

157
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
in the car.

158
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
The painting is not good.

159
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Mr. Cheng, Mr. Xiao.

160
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
This is the Yan Pin's evidence.

161
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
The two-way code?

162
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
This is a female painting.

163
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
It's from the style of the poison.

164
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Yes.

165
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I'll go and check it out.

166
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

167
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Mr. Cheng.

168
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

169
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

170
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Yes.

171
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
What do you mean?

172
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Xitou, save me!

173
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
The task is too simple.

174
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
The system can't be refused.

175
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Don't bother me.

176
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
It's not that simple.

177
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Xitou.

178
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,320
What he meant was...

179
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,400
It's still not right.

180
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,360
Here.

181
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm so excited after this.

182
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,760
Xiao Zui,

183
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
why are you waiting for me?

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
Get up.

185
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,160
No.

186
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
I'm done talking.

187
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,360
Xiao Zui,

188
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,880
how do you know

189
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,060
there was aã¼ãæµ?

190
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,120
You may not believe it.

191
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,960
Whatever you said.

192
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,960
Never mind.

193
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,160
I see.

194
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,020
Theé¡ist of yours

195
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,760
plus Fang Meng Tian's heyday,

196
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,460

I...

198
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,400
No.

If you don't believe me, I can put you in jail.

204
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
All the objects have been calculated.

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Okay, then you can break it.

206
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
If you're wrong,

207
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I'll give you two pieces of the arm.

208
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Two pieces.

Old man is a devil.
