00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,080
A DI DE or 9A B OD AN VL 71 ON 9E.

BAMOR9ABOBOANVL7ION9E

3
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,880
Take off your clothes.

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,600
What? You want a grandchild?

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,600
You want a grandchild.

6
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,840
Honey, I know you have a grudge.

7
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,320
Hang in there.

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,280
Until when?

9
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,680
If you can't get pregnant, listen to your mom.

10
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,360
Find someone who can give birth.

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Nonsense.

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,440
I'm going to stay with my mom tomorrow.

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,080
If it doesn't work,

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,440
just get a divorce.

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,560
Don't listen to my mom.

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,280
How could I divorce you?

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,840
Or what?

18
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,320
You either drive me crazy or drive your mom crazy.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
Choose one.

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,320
I think you're pushing me to death.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,000
My mom just wants a grandson.

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,320
Why can't you understand each other?

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,760
Am I not understanding enough?

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,840
What else do you want me to understand?

25
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
You bought a good tea this time.

26
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,480
Mom, have some tea.

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,120
Okay.

28
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,600
Xixi, let me tell you.

29
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,480
That's enough.

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,760
How many days have you been here?

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,800
I won't compromise so easily this time.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
Don't be upset.

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,560
Let's talk when he comes.

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,200
He can bear to leave his dear mother.

35
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,440
Forget it.

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,840
Forget it.

37
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,920
Just let it go.

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
What's wrong?

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,840
Kaian.

40
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,760
Why don't you look for Xu Xi again?

41
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,160
If she doesn't come back, don't come back.

42
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,280
Mom, she really doesn't want to come back.

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
What else do you want?

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,560
You want me to apologize to her

45
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
to apologize to her.

46
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
No, mom.

47
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,680
Don't you think what you said that day

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,840
you said that day?

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,200
How am I?

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,880
I just want a grandchild.

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,600
It's her duty to marry you.

52
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,760
Yes, Mom.

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,240
I'm going to work.

54
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,360
Take care.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,880
What?

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,480
I can tell.

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,640
It's great that you're fine.

58
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,480
Wenxi. Mom.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,880
What's wrong with Wenxi?

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,320
Ask her.

61
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,320
Wenxi, what's wrong?

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,440
Honey.

63
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,800
Don't worry.

64
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm not in a hurry. Don't be afraid.

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,800
I'm pregnant.

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm pregnant.

67
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,600
Look.

68
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,120
Really pregnant

69
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,400
When did that happen?

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,760
You didn't tell me.

71
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
I just found out too.

72
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,440
Ms. Chen, you've been pregnant for two months.

73
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,680
Can I abort the doctor?

74
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,320
You're not allowed to have an abortion.

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,680
Once you have an abortion,

76
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,120
you may not be able to get pregnant again.

77
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,440
Ya Lu, Mr. Zhao, I'm not going tonight.

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm going home. Thank you for sending him off.

79
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,920
Kaian.

80
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
I didn't want to trouble you at this time,

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,040
But I thought about it for a long time.

82
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
You have the right to know.

83
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,120
What do you mean?

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,280
Yours.

85
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
Chen Yalu.

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,680
You always surpass my expectations.

87
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,080
I didn't expect that either.

88
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,520
Did you plan this?

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
Who do you think I am?

90
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,760
In your eyes,

91
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,960
am I that kind of woman

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
to get promoted?

93
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
Have I ever forced you

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,320
Did I force you to do anything?

95
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
I went to the hospital because I was sick.

96
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,000
I just found out.

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Don't hesitate.

98
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,080
It's no big deal. Just hit him.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
Are you serious?

100
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,120
What else?

101
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,680
It's not fair

102
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,880
is not fair to this child.

103
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,880
Yale, I'll make it up to you.

104
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,720
I will.

105
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,520
I'm the one who negotiated

106
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,000
of the company.

107
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,720
With my current capability,

108
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,120
how will you compensate me?

109
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,040
I'll discuss with Xu Xi

110
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
I'll give you some of the company's shares.

111
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,040
You can consider it.

112
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,720
If I don't want it, you'll be worried.

113
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,840
You always feel like you owe me, right?

114
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,520
No, Ah Ro, that's not what I meant.

115
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,320
Okay, I know everything I need to know.

116
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,240
Since it's holiday,

117
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,760
Xu Xi asked me out this afternoon.

118
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,720
Yale.

119
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,240
What about Xu Xi?

120
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,560
Don't worry. I won't tell her.

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,280
I'm more afraid of losing her than you.

122
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,040
Wenxi.

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
What are you thinking?

124
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,680
I think I should go back.

125
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,360
Don't go back. Leave your bad mother-in-law alone.

126
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
and force you to divorce.

127
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,000
That's too much.

128
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
You don't know how many times I met her.

129
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,840
She always badmouthed you and said bad things about you.

130
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
If it weren't for Kaian's sake,

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,560
I would have given her a speech.

132
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,640
But this time,

133
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm pregnant.

134
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,080
What?

135
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,600
I was going to get a divorce.

136
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,720
It's good to get pregnant suddenly.

137
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,280
But when I think

138
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,480
what if it's a daughter?

139
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,680
I can't keep giving birth.

140
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,159
This is really difficult.

141
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,200
Should we divorce or not?

142
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,400
Will you accept it or stand up?

143
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Have you read too much Shakespeare recently?

144
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,680
I mean,

145
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,040
no matter what decision you make,

146
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,680
I will support you.

147
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
It's good to have you.

148
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,360
What are you wiping?

149
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,200
Go watch TV

150
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,200
Mom, what is this?

151
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
I made bird's nest for you.

152
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Drink it.

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you, Mom.

154
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,160
Yale.

155
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,600
Look at his attitude.

156
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,760
It's a 180-degree change.

157
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,920
Now I'm afraid of falling

158
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,240
I'm afraid it'll melt in my mouth.

159
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,760
He wouldn't let me kiss Kaian.

160
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
and forced us to sleep in separate rooms.

161
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
I can't do it tomorrow. I have to go for the checkup tomorrow.

162
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,840
Okay.

163
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,200
Bye.

164
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Honey.

165
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,400
I made our mom suffer.

166
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
She snored.

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,480
I miss you so much.

168
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
Hurry up.

169
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,880
Can you do it?

170
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,360
Yes.

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,760
Leave it here.

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,600
Anything else?

173
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,800
Come with me to the hospital.

174
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,080
I want to beat him up.

175
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,400
Actor table.

176
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,000
