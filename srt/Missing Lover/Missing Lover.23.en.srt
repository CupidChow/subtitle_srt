3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,520
Kaian, you're back.

4
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,200
Whose child is it?

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,440
What child?

6
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,840
Tell me, whose child is it?

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,960
You killed Xu Xi.

8
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,560
and my mother.

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,240
You ruined my family.

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
You despicable man.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,760
Shameless.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,400
You should be the one to die.

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,640
Enough, Liu Kaian.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,520
Do you think I want to?

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,000
I did it for you.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,000
For your stupid company.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
I'll trade my body for your performance.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,720
What's wrong with raising a child?

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,920
This is equivalent exchange.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,840
How shameless

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,440
to say that.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,039
Now,

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,840
Take your bastard

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,160
Get lost!

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,240
I feel sorry for Xu Xi.

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,960
How could I fall in love with a man like you?

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm even more ridiculous.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,240
How could I steal you from her?

29
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,400
Fight!

30
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,520
It's better if you kill me.

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,720
It doesn't matter anymore.

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,199
Get lost.

33
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,840
I can't find you.

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,000
Let me see you.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,360
What's wrong?

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,920
Where's Yale?

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,840
I told her to get lost.

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,960
What?

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm sorry to Xu Xi.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,079
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,440
It's too late now.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
Kaian.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,320
You have your mother,

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,160
and my daughter.

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,840
and your company.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,200
Don't think like that.

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
I have my company.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
and my mom.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,160
Kiki.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,360
I beg you, do me a favor.

51
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,160
What is it?

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
I like you.

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,000
I know you like me too.

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,920
When we get married,

55
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,960
your brother will help me.

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,640
Then the company will be saved.

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
So you married me

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,760
for the company.

59
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,280
If the company saved me, I can make money.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
I can buy you a lot of things.

61
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,760
Trust me.

62
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,600
I will give you the best.

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,640
You don't love me at all.

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,880
You just want your company.

65
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,840
I love you.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,160
But...

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,520
Look at me now.

68
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm like a stray dog.

69
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,280
How can I love you?

70
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,400
In your heart,

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm just a stepping stone.

72
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,720
No.

73
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,960
Kiki, how about this?

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,320
I'll propose to you.

75
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
Marry me, please marry me.

76
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,560
Liu Kaian.

77
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,640
You really let me down.

78
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
This is your nature.

79
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,640
Nothing you say is true.

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,760
Don't go.

81
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,640
Don't go. Don't go. Let me go. What are you doing?

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,120
I like you. What are you doing?

83
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Liu Kaian.

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,440
Liu Kaian, are you out of your mind?

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,440
Help me.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,280
Are you crazy?

87
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,400
Liu Kaian, let go of me! Let go of me!

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,360
Let go!

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
You bastard!

90
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,600
Kiki.

91
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,320
I was wrong.

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
Ah.

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,400
Kiki.

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
So

95
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,240
this is how you give up on a man.

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,880
What else can you do besides being sarcastic?

97
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,560
I'm grateful to Liu Kaian.

98
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,080
You don't want such a good wife.

99
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,240
for free.

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,960
If you mention him again, I'll cripple you.

101
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
Okay, I won't.

102
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Okay.

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Let's go.

104
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,360
I have the check ready.

105
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,560
I'll go by myself.

106
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,720
This is between us.

107
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,720
Whether it's good or bad,

108
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,040
no matter it's good or bad.

109
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,920
But...

110
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,920
Ji Jiang,

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,840
You've helped me too much.

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,920
Let me face it myself this time.

113
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,200
Don't worry.

114
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,200
I won't be hurt by him again.

115
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,600
Miss Kiki.

116
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,160
Thank you for coming today.

117
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,240
My wife, Xu Xi.

118
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,640
is confirmed dead.

119
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,400
As her husband,

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,880
I must hold a farewell ceremony for her.

121
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,800
Liu Kaian.

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,640
Today is the acquisition contract signing day.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
Who are you disgusting?

124
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Miss Kiki.

125
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,760
Watch your language.

126
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,200
After all,

127
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,360
the dead should be the priority.

128
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,480
Xu Xi is dead.

129
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,920
She's really dead at this moment.

130
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,480
But it doesn't hinder us from signing the contract.

131
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,040
Yes.

132
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,640
You have to wait

133
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,200
after I finish the funeral.

134
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,480
Sure.

135
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,840
I can wait.

136
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,440
Maybe a day

137
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,960
Maybe a year.

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,200
My love with my wife is very deep.

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,280
Maybe this will be a lifetime.

140
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Then you have to wait.

141
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,640
You love her so much.

142
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
yet you want to use her death to play dirty.

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,920
Liu Kaian, do you have any limits?

144
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,159
But she's dead.

145
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,240
What can I do?

146
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
What if Xu Xi is still alive?

147
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,520
Okay.

148
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,640
If she's alive,

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,560
let her stand here and sign it.

150
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,480
Not only that.

151
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I'll even give you the company, okay?

152
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,720
I'll sign it for her.
