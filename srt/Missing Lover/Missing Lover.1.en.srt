00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,680
Miss Kiki,

2
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,160
thank you for coming today.

3
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,120
My wife, Xu Xi, has been confirmed dead.

4
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,840
As her husband,

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,680
I must hold a farewell ceremony for her.

6
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,560
Liu Kai'an,

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,000
today is the day to sign the acquisition contract.

8
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,640
Who are you trying to disgust with this act?

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
Please mind your words.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,680
After all,

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,580
we should show respect for the deceased.

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,800
Xu Xi is dead.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,130
At this moment, she's really dead.

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,080
However, it doesn't prevent us from signing the contract.

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,920
Indeed.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,729
You'll at least wait for me to finish the funeral, won't you?

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
What if Xu Xi is still alive?

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,080
Well, okay.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,120
if she's alive,

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,120
have her stand here and sign it.

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,479
Not just sign,

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,920
I'll even give you the whole company, okay?

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,759
Then I'll sign on her behalf.

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,850
Don't forget what we agreed on.

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,640
I'll be going now.

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,400
The company's profits for the first half of the year have exceeded expectations,

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,320
especially in the home goods department

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
and clothing categories

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
where profits have doubled.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
So I've decided

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,720
to promote Chen Yalu to Deputy General Manager of the company.

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,120
Okay.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Yalu,

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,329
why don't you share your plans with everyone?

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,400
Thank you, Mr. Liu and colleagues, for your recognition.

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
The mother and baby sector

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
has always been a gap in the industry.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
The potential is immeasurable.

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,240
My idea is as follows:

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,920
starting from next quarter,

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,020
How is it going?

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,480
What sin have I committed?

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,480
Why is it so difficult for me to have a grandson?

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,160
Mom, Kai'an and I have been trying our best.

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,720
Trying?

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,370
Even trying should have some results.

47
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,079
Xixi, it's been five years already.

48
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,880
You can't give birth to a son.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,840
You've ended our family line.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,680
How can I face Kai'an's father?

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,560
Mom,

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
having a child also requires the right conditions.

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,000
It needs the right time, place, and circumstances.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,600
Your worrying doesn't help.

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,560
You think I'm nagging, don't you?

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,920
You can't give birth to a son,

57
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,400
and I'm not even allowed to say a word about it?

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,120
How comfortable you are.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,920
You don't even have to work.

60
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,320
My son is supporting you.

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
You're the young madam of the house.

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,760
Mom, I'll have a child for you, I will.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,530
Mommy, play with me for a while.

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,000
Yiyi,

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
good baby.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,320
If you could give me a grandson,

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,880
I'd worship you like an ancestor.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,640
My dear wife, I'm begging you.

69
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,360
Please bring it to the company for me.

70
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Okay, okay, okay.

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,159
Alright, I'll hang up now.

72
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,400
Still cuddling with your wife during work hours, huh?

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,480
My big boss Liu.

74
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,360
Don't talk nonsense.

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,020
I forgot the contract at home.

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,760
Thanks for the promotion.

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
You earned it. You deserve it.

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,080
Sister Xixi,

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,760
long time no see.

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Yeah, how's work been lately?

81
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,120
It's going well.

82
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,280
Get back to work.

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
You've really grown into your executive temperament.

84
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,560
General Manager Chen, you're quite imposing.

85
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
How else would I keep them in line?

86
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't you think so, boss's wife?

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,880
Oh, come on.

88
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,160
Seeing you act all serious makes me want to laugh.

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,320
Keep your voice down.

90
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,080
Honey.

91
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,650
Darling.

92
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,300
You must be exhausted.

93
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm asking for two hours off for Yalu.

94
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Oh, okay.

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,120
You're the one who got Kai'an to promote me, right?

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,840
Even though we're best friends,

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,280
you can't be so blatant

98
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,340
about favoring me.

99
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,120
Be careful, or I'll become the target of jealousy.

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,760
Well, who told my bestie to be beautiful and kind-hearted,

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,490
not to mention capable at work?

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
Oh, stop it.

103
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,560
I envy you.

104
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,440
You married Kai'an right after graduation.

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,400
All you need to do is stay at home, support your husband, and raise the kids.

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,360
Unlike me,

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,520
I have to hustle for everything myself. It's exhausting.

108
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,450
Every family has its own problems.

109
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
My mother-in-law,

110
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,300
she's started her big moves again recently.

111
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,680
Kai'an's mother is at it again?

112
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
You bet.

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,600
She's pressuring us every day to have a grandchild.

114
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,080
It's not something I can solve on my own, you know?

115
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Kai'an is so exhausted from work every day.

116
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,840
As soon as he gets home and hits the pillow, you can't even wake him up.

117
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,570
Forget about our marital life,

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,130
now even touching his hand feels like I'm taking advantage.

119
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
It can't be that bad, can it?

120
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,640
Kai'an seems fine to me.

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,360
Only the user knows.

122
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,640
Right, about your mother-in-law,

123
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
don't always indulge her.

124
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,010
You need to be firm when necessary.

125
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,220
Besides, you and Kai'an started the company together.

126
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,600
Why should she always give you attitude?

127
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,280
I don't want to put Kai'an in a difficult position between us.

128
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,120
I thought,

129
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,360
I'll just endure it.

130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Yours looks tastier than mine.

131
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
Aren't they all the same?

132
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Here, here, here. You always want to take what's mine.

133
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,620
I've found the person.

134
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
Kneel down.

135
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,840
Mom, what's this?

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,930
Kneel down, kneel down.

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,920
Come on, repeat after me.

138
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,410
Oh, great deity,

139
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,200
bless Xu Xi to conceive a son.

140
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,240
Mom,

141
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,740
isn't this feudal superstition?

142
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,290
Shut up and repeat after me.

143
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,360
Mom, my ball rolled over there.

144
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,680
You little brat.

145
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
Mom.

146
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,720
What are you doing?

147
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,080
Yiyi is still young.

148
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,800
You two are really bad luck.

149
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm destined to never have a grandson.

150
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,450
What are you saying?

151
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,840
Even if you want a grandson so badly,

152
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Yiyi is still your granddaughter.

153
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,770
How can you say such things?

154
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,210
Xu Xi.

155
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,000
How dare you talk to Mom like that?

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,240
How did I talk?

157
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,120
All these years, for the sake of having a grandson,

158
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
what has this family been turned into?

159
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,360
Can we still live a normal life?

160
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
Xu Xi, shut up.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,720
Liu Kai'an.

162
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,440
This is how your wife talks to your mother.

163
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,920
Xu Xi, apologize to Mom right now.

164
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,560
Liu Kai'an.

165
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,960
No need to apologize.

166
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,240
Xu Xi.

167
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Our Liu family married you, we don't owe you anything.

168
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,680
If you're not willing to have children,

169
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,140
I'll find someone who can, and you can leave.

170
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,919
Mom, why are you talking about this?

171
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,770
Don't be angry, please don't be angry.

172
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,799
Chen Yalu has only been with the company for half a year,

173
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,480
and she's already snatched the company's two hottest accounts.

174
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
That's quite a skill.

175
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,679
Indeed.

176
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,880
No matter how good your performance is, you're still working for the boss's wife, aren't you?

177
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,880
Thank you.

178
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,360
You look so cool playing basketball. Can you teach me?

179
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,920
Sure.

180
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,120
It's a deal then.

181
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,840
Okay.

182
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,330
Hey, classmate,

183
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,560
we have a basketball game tomorrow.

184
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,620
