00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,080

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,040
BAMORO 9ABOBOANVL7ION9E

3
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
I think

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,320
I still think

5
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,600
it's too early for you to tell Chen Yalu.

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,800
The arrow is on the string. I have to shoot.

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,000
But to be honest,

8
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,879
I was a bit impulsive.

9
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,600
It's okay.

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,680
Anyway, Liu Kaian has taken the bait.

11
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
It's not a big problem.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,720
As long as we give out a little bit of small profits,

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,880
I believe

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,600
he will continue to burn money.

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,800
What's wrong?

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,480
I can't stand it.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,880
The company is in a mess because of them.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,320
Isn't that a good thing?

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,800
The messier they are,

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,920
the more likely we'll have a chance to meet.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,160
Stab him to death.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,039
But I started this company together.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,280
It hurts my heart.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
You don't want it?

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,720
Don't torture it.

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,520
Don't worry. Kaixi will get it soon.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,759
Taking over the company is just one step.

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
What else do you want?

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
A man who betrays his family

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,000
who betrayed his family and his wife,

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,160
should have his karma.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,600
Kiki, I'm so happy today.

33
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,160
You saved the company, which means you saved me.

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,400
Don't thank me.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I know, men

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,880
career comes first.

37
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,480
Kaixi is my hope.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
After all,

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,720
Is it created with Xu Xi after all?

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,960
He can't forget his ex-wife.

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,079
and single-minded, right?

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,400
No, Chen Yalu.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,160
Why are you talking about this today?

44
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,640
Kiki saved our company.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,120
She's our savior and our precious.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
You should thank him.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,400
Fine. How should I thank you?

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,040
I'll kneel down to show my sincerity.

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,040
Chen Yalu.

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Are you kneeling or not?

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,480
I'll leave you two alone.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,080
Kiki.

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,280
The contract is a success today.

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,920
Let's celebrate tonight.

55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,160
I have plans tonight. Next time.

56
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,400
Okay.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,960
Be careful.

58
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
Chen Yalu.

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
What's wrong with you?

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,400
Do you think Jaroe really loves Liu Kaian?

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,880
Not necessarily.

62
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,160
She loves herself.

63
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,400
It's not that she can't win.

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,160
but she can't afford to lose.

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
Once you have obsession,

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
people tend to go astray.

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,600
I have obsession too.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,400
That's why I'm here.

69
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,800
I didn't let you run away.

70
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,120
Women are emotional animals. I understand.

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,440
You know women so well?

72
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,200
I studied female psychology.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,400
What am I thinking now?

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,600
What do you mean?

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,720
I know nothing about you.

76
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,120
But I really believed

77
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,160
Because of love.

78
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,400
Go away.

79
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
You should thank me.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
For what?

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,079
Thank me for not being angry in public

82
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,200
and embarrassed you.

83
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,920
You're back.

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Mom.

85
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,200
I prepared a table of good dishes

86
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,880
to celebrate your successful signing.

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,760
Thank you, mom.

88
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,640
Yes.

89
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,960
We're celebrating the contract.

90
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,680
We might have a banquet next time.

91
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,040
Can you stop talking?

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,800
What do you mean?

93
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,760
Nothing.

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,800
Why are you here?

95
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,360
She asked me out.

96
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,120
It's hard to express her kindness.

97
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,280
I know

98
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
you're here to piss me off.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,720
You're half done.

100
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,880
I'm angry.

101
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,040
But after thinking about it,

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,640
I didn't want you to be too proud.

103
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,320
So I calmed down.

104
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,080
If you break down at one touch,

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,640
I think it's boring.

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,480
But your method is too low.

107
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,400
It doesn't matter if it works.

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,200
As long as it works.

109
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,840
That's true.

110
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,080
But I'm more confident than you.

111
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,560
I like to be in a daze on the balcony.

112
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,840
Sometimes I think

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,480
if I can stay in a corner

114
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,880
in a corner

115
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,920
and enjoy the happiness and romance quietly.

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,440
That would be great.

117
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
Men prefer the wide sky.

118
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
I won't be with you all the time.

119
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,480
That's right.

120
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,200
God has given men the vast world.

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,920
But as long as the woman he loves is waiting for him,

122
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,520
he will come back.

123
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,200
Oh, right.

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,280
do you think

125
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,520
watching everything?

126
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,000
and watching the man he loves

127
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,960
and everything that happened here.

128
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,200
What do you mean?

129
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
Why are you nervous?

130
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,280
Are you scared of Xu Xi?

131
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,400

132
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,520

133
