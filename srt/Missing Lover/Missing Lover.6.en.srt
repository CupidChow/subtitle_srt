00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,720
Why is the vomiting reaction so strong?

4
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,720
I don't know.

5
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,040
Kaian, is there something wrong with the child?

6
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,960
No.

7
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,000
If it doesn't work, go to the hospital for prenatal check-up tomorrow.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,880
Don't worry.

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,520
It's mainly obvious now.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,720
I'm afraid I can't hide it in the company.

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,640
Didn't my mom ask you to go home and take care of your baby?

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,600
You're not going.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,920
Xu Xi used to live in that house.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,039
I'm not going.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,520
What do you want to do?

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,120
Why don't we buy a new house?

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,760
Kaian.

18
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,280
I think we can buy this small apartment.

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,840
I like it. It can save money for you.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,840
It's safer if you don't buy it.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,039
Where should I live if I don't buy it?

22
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,400
I live in the current house.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,120
So many rooms.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Ah Lu.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,640
We are in an important period of pregnancy protection.

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,320
We have to be careful about everything.

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,000
The formaldehyde in the new house is too high.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,039
It's not suitable for you and my grandson for years.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,960
Yes, mom is right.

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,479
Xu Xi lived in that house.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Besides, your son didn't marry me.

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,400
How can I live there?

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,520
I don't care.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,639
Don't worry.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,480
I will take good care of you.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,720
As long as you agree to move in,

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Don't worry. You won't see anything of Xu Xi.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,079
Well...

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,920
Yalu, I think our mom is right.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
How about this? We listen to her.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,200
When the child grows up,

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,920
we can

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,320
to a bigger house.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,440
Okay?

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,520
It's a deal.

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,040
It's a deal, right, mom?

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,600
I'll buy it when I'm born.

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
When the baby is born, buy it right away.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,720
Okay mom

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
Okay.

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,520
And as you said, clean the house.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,920
Absolutely clean.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,280
It must be clean.

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,480
Okay?

55
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,680
How do you feel?

56
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,200
Are you feeling better?

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,360
Who are you?

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,800
I’ve told you several times. My name is Ji Jiang.

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,720
Your brain is in a short circuit.

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,800
Don't think about anything.

61
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,480
Listen to me.

62
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,520
In life,

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
in life.

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,640
For example, I never wanted to be a hero.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,720
In the end, I saved a beauty by accident.

66
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,120
So,

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,400
what happened later?

68
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,600
If you want to know,

69
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
let's make a deal.

70
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,400
no matter what you see,

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,600
you have to endure it.

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,880
That's impossible.

73
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,600
Kaian won't leave me alone.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not true.

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,279
It's not true.

76
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm going to find them.

77
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
That's enough. With your current body,

78
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,480
You can't even stand. Forget it.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,200
I want to go.

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,280
Take me there.

81
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,000
Please.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
Ji Jiang.

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,880
Slow down. Don't drag my grandson.

Liu Kaian.

85
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,280
You did a good job.

86
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Mom, what brings you here?

87
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,280
Mother-in-law, you're here. Come in.

89
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,400
You and Wenxi are best friends.

90

Look at what you've done.

91
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,480
Think about it.

92
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Don't you feel sorry for Wenxi?

Auntie.

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,520
This is a bit complicated.

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,360
It's hard to explain.

96
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,000
Please understand.

97
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
I understand.

98
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,720
How dare you ask me to understand?

99
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,440
Mom.

100
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,600
Get lost!

101
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,640
Don't call me mom.

102
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,720
Let's go, Yi Yi.

104

Do you deserve it?

105

Let's go, Yi Yi.

106
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,280
Wait.

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,080
With your current condition,

108
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,160
it's useless to go there.

109
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
Let's go.

110
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,360
How is it?

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,120
Are you satisfied?

112
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,880
That's it.

113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
No matter how much I clean, Xu Xi used to live here.

114
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,360
That's enough.

115
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,800
If you didn't insist on letting me stay here,

116
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
I wouldn't have come.

117
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,760
I got scolded by someone before I came in.

118
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,000
How unlucky.

119
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,080
Yale, I'll cook whatever you want.

120
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm fine with anything.

121
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,040
Thank you, Mom.

122
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
I didn't get excited

123
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,600
when my dream came true.

124
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,880
You can stay here for the time being.

126
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,040
and saved me.

127
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,600
That's not important.

128
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,720
