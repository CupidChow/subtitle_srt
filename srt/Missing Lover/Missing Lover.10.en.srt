3
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,480
Mr. Liu.

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,400
Why are you here?

5
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,560
Miss Kiki.

6
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,160
Mr. Liu, you have such a good memory.

7
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,600
You still remember my name.

8
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,760
I was impressed when you came that day.

9
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,320
But why didn't you come to work after that?

10
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,680
Unfortunately,

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,080
I received a rejected email from your company.

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,000
I didn't refuse.

13
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,800
Maybe the underlings made a mistake.

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Yihang.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,120
I'll pay for

17
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,039
for tonight.

18
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,840
Okay, Kiki.

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,680
No need.

20
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,400
How can you let a girl pay the bill?

21
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,960
Kiki, I'll be embarrassed.

22
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,480
You're welcome, Mr Liu.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,680
This bar is mine.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,840
Yours?

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,480
Anyway,

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
we won't see each other again.

27
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,960
Just take it as my treat.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,160
Take your time.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Miss Kiki.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,600
I wonder if you have time

31
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,560
to have a drink with me.

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
Mr. Liu, are you drinking to drown your sorrow?

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Almost.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,640
Let me think.

35
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,240
There are only two things

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
There are only two things.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
One is your career being obstructed,

38
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,280
and family bond.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,079
Mr. Liu seems to have

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
Miss Kiki.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,079
You seem to know how to read faces.

42
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,280
Of course.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
It's all on your face.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Okay.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,520
What else can you see?

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,120
Why did you stop?

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
What's there to say?

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,040
Do you want me to guess

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,120
Mr. Chen of your company

50
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,480
is not the original wife?

51
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,840
Kiki.

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,680
Although your resume is blank,

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,079
your experience in life

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,160
is much older than you.

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
How can you open a bar if you don't have much experience?

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,360
Yes.

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,240
I wish all women were like you.

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,480
Humans are different.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,480
Whether a woman can become your bond

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,880
You have the initiative.

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,360
It's just a matter of whether you want it or not.

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,520
Here's to you.

63
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
Chen Yalu.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,480
Don't worry.

65
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,640
She has thought of many things.

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,880
She just won't say it.

67
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,880
Enough, stop talking.

68
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,680
Look for it. Do you think we can hide a servant here?

69
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,480
Then why don't you go home?

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Why?

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,960
Keep arguing with you.

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm tired even if you're not tired.

73
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,240
Don't blame everything on me.

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,520
I told you, but you didn't listen.

75
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,360
What's the point of saying this now?

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,160
I'll earn back the money.

77
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,720
Now I only beg you

78
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,200
give me some time.

79
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,840
Please give me a sense of security.

80
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm confused right now.

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,080
I don't want to talk about anything.

82
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,440
Let me rest.

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,720
Okay, I'll go.

84
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,760
Who told you I was here?

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,800
I don't know. It's a strange number.

86
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
Did you send someone to follow me?

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,360
I didn't. Please don't frame me.

88
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,840
Mr. Huang,

89
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,160
Although we used to be competitors,

90
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,560
I sincerely hope

91
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,520
I hope you can consider our cooperation.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,240
Really?

93
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm very interested.

94
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,520
Let me introduce

95
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,160
our cooperation.

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,200
Kaixi

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,040
can build these two live streaming base

98
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,840
into a private streaming base.

99
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
The so-called private broadcasting base

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,320
is to show their specialties.

101
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,240
and let them make it live in the live stream room.

102
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,480
We hope this base

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
invest about 100 million.

104
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,560
We have 20 million.

105
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,760
So I hope you can invest

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,240
into this.
