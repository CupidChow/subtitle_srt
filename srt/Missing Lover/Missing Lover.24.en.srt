Xu Xi.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,360
You're a human, a ghost.

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,360
I let you down.

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,440
I'm still alive.

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,920
Ah Lu is right.

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,240
You pretended to be Kiki

10
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,520
to get close to me.

11
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,840
You came back to take revenge on me.

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,080
Revenge?

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,760
Do you think you deserve it?

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,880
I'm here to get my things back.

15

Sign it.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,200
Honey.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,479
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,759
Please forgive me.

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,240
Well,

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,479
Chen Yalu.

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,560
I've kicked her out.

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,440
I've been waiting for you.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,600
I've always loved you.

24
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,320
Give me another chance.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,440
Let's be together again, okay?

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,640
What time is it now?

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,039
Is it fun to say that?

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,720
It's too late.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
Not at all.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,039
Let's start over.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,960
Then the company will be saved.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,240
Besides, Yi Yi can't live without his mother.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,600
She can't live without her dad.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,360
You know you're Yi Yi's father?

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,560
I thought you forgot.

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,200
I have a way to save the company.

37
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,160
Death can be a tool for you to cheat.

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,840
You only want to use me when you're alive.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,760
I'm your pawn.

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,079
No, no, honey.

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,079
Listen to me.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
It's not like that. Let me explain.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,079
Enough.

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,120
Liu Kaian.

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,240
All the grudges

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
between us

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,800
all ended

48
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,320
is over.

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,240
These two incense sticks

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
One.

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,800
It's a memorial service for our dead marriage.

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,920
A pillar.

53
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,240
It's a memorial service for our unborn child.

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,880
I grew up

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,240
without a father's love.

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,320
I will never allow my Yi

57
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,840
to repeat my mistake.

58
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,560
This check

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
is enough to buy

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,120
in the company.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,640
I hope you can

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,920
a good father from now on.

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
Bye.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,320
How did I see this basketball player

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,200
when I was in school?

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,960
I couldn't walk.

67
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,520
Maybe at that time,

68
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,440
men who play basketball are the most handsome.

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,880
Is yours good?

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,839
Give me a sip.

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,240
Drink your own.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Actually,

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,120
It's not good to steal something.

74
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
By the way,

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,480
Is everything done?

76
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,840
I have

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
I got everything back.

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,640
If you can't,

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,640
is not worth it.

80
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,560
What do you think?

81
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,840
You're a mother now.

82
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,840
What are you going to do next?

83
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,960
Leave here.

84
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,120
Find a place where no one knows me.

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,440
and start over.

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,280
That's all.

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,840
I should go.
