00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,080
A DI DE or 9A B OD AN VL 71 ON 9E.

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,040
BAMOR9ABOBABOANVL7ION9E

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,400
Come with me to the hospital.

4
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,680
I want to go to the hospital

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,480
Today?

6
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,880
Can't we do it another day?

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,560
Why?

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,400
The hospital is scheduled for today.

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,960
Come with me.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,440
[But today, I...]

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,360
Liu Kaian.

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,880
This is your child after all.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,840
You have to send her off.

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,800
Yale, I'll wait for you here.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,840
Go in by yourself later.

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,680
Liu Kaian.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,800
Aren't you willing to pay for this?

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,440
It's over.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
It's all over.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,480
You won't feel guilty anymore.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,120
Yale, I'm begging you.

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,840
I'll wait for you here, okay?

23
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,400
How about this? I'll give you a month off.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
Have a good rest for a month.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,800
Anyway,

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,680
this is your child.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,600
He is a life.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,160
Before he came to this world,

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,960
before he came to this world.

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,840
Can't you give him a ride?

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm the one who's suffering the most.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,720
It's my first time too.

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm scared.

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,880
Is it so hard to let you stay with me?

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,280
Besides,

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,000
Wenxi.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
Why are you here?

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,760
No, he's not from Kaian.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,920
I just asked him to keep me company, right?

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,160
Honey, listen to me.

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm here with Ah Lu.

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,680
miscarriage is very harmful to the patient's body.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,640
She may not be able to get pregnant again.

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,880
My grandson is gone.

45
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,880
Auntie.

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,040
Hey, Kaian.

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,680
What's going on?

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Why did she suddenly have a miscarriage?

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,680
Mom, something happened.

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,920
What happened?

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,920
Wenxi.

52
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,560
Xi Xi.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,680
Kaian.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,600
Did you set this up?

55
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,920
I didn't expect this to happen.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you want Xu Xi to see

57
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
What are you doing?

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,520
What did we do to you?

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
You didn't do me wrong.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,520
I didn't do anything wrong to you.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
I just think Xu Xi doesn't deserve you.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,440
You should belong to me.

63
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,680
Women are like this sometimes.

64
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,680
Once they fall in love, they go crazy.

65
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't love you at all.

66
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Even if Xu Xi can't get pregnant again,

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,240
it's not your turn.

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,760
Liu Kaian.

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,000
My grandson is gone.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,720
our Liu family is going to lose their family.

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
I'm sorry to his father.

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,040
and my family.

73
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,680
Aunt, don't cry.

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,519
I feel bad too.

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,960
I wish I could give birth to your grandson.

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,640
Yale.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,120
It's already like this.

78
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,400
Stop teasing me.

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,600
Aunt, I'm not kidding.

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm serious.

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,360
Yale.

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
What did you do with Kaian today?

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,320
Nothing.

84
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
Auntie, I'm not feeling well. I'm leaving.

85
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,640
Tell me the truth.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Tell me.

87
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,160
Auntie.

88
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,560
Mom, Xu Xi has been discharged.

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
She's recovering well.

90
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
She just doesn't want to go home.

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,920
to her mother.

92
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,320
I didn't ask you that.

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,200
Let me ask you.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,800
Whose child is Chen Yalu's?

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,760
Mom.

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,720
Who told you that?

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,040
Let me ask you, whose child is Chen Yalu's.

98
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,600
It was an accident.

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,840
I wanted a grandchild.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
But you did this.

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,840
I'll be criticized.

102
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,000
Why did I have a son like you?

103
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,440
Mom, I took Chen Yalu to the hospital that day

104
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,720
to beat the child.

105
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,200
That's why I met Xu Xi.

106
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
What have I done wrong?

107
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,240
Are you sure Chen Yalu's child is yours?

108
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,880
What do you mean?

109
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,280
Chen Yalu's child has to stay.

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,320
What are you going to do with Xu Xi?

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,720
Why?

112
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
There's no reason.

113
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,440
It happened naturally.

114
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,200
It's easier said than done.

115
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,000
It's like you're still stealing something this time.

116
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm used to it.

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,320
I can't change it now.

118
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,320
As for Kaian,

119
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,120
Let's split it.

120
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,640
I don't mind having you.

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,880
Chen Yalu.

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,000
How despicable

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
to say that?

124
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,280
You were betrayed by the man you love and your best friend.

125
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,880
I understand your sadness.

126
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,120
You

127
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,720
have always been like a perfect art.

128
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,520
like a perfect art.

129
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,920
I envy you.

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,840
You're jealous of me.

131
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,080
That's why you're jealous of everything about me.

132
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,600
You don't have to pretend to be pitiful.

133
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
You're my best friend

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,480
because you have a good background.

135
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,520
After all,

136
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,000
White Swan

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,920
needs an ugly duckling like me

138
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,840
can match its nobility.

139
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,600
In your heart,

140
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,680
in your heart?

141
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,600
I liked Kaian first.

142
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,240
Speaking of snatching, I think you snatched mine.

143
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,520
Yes, you liked Kaian first.

144
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,240
But you quit on your own.

145
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
That's right.

146
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,600
So you've been holding back all these years.

147
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,520
You never treated me sincerely.

148
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,480
I never treated you as my best friend.

149
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,520
Yes.

150
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,520
I quit first.

151
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,640
But now, I'm capable and capable.

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,440
Everything I get

153
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,320
is based on my own ability.

154
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,640
including Kaian.

155
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
Your child is gone.

156
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,720
But my baby is here.

157
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,039
My baby is gone.

158
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,920
My baby is gone.

159
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,120
you two are the culprit.

160
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,080
Don't worry. I won't divorce you.

161
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
Your child can only be an illegitimate child.

162
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,960
You and your child

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,560
hide in the dark corner for the rest of your life.

164
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,360
and never see the light.

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,600
Wenxi.

166
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Wenxi.

167
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,480
Just in time.

168
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,200
the person involved is here.

169
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Honey.

170
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
Listen to me.

171
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,680
No.

172
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,320
Honey, don't listen to her nonsense.

173
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,200
Just give me one chance.

174
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,480
Our daughter is still young.

175
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,880
When you made a mistake,

176
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,400
when you made a mistake?

177
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,440
I was just impulsive.

178
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,240
Can I change it?

179
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,280
This...

180
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,240
How can I change it?

181
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Shut up!

182
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,880
Honey.

183
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,920
I don't want anything now.

184
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
I just want us to go home together.

185
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
Let's live a good life.

186
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
Please forgive me.

187
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
What about our baby?

188
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,400
You...

189
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,520
How about this?

190
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,800
I'll help you.
