BAMOR9ABOBOANVL7ION9E

3
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,880
You asked me to come here

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,280
Are you trying to push me down from here?

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,360
Who are you?

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,200
How should I answer this question?

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,400
Or what answer do you want to hear?

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
I'll just tell you.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,280
Tell me your purpose, maybe

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,240
I can let you go.

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,160
Judging from your tone,

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,320
I think you have something on me.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,760
Is it in this bag?

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,560
Leave Liu Kaian.

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,480
and never show up again.

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,240
Okay.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,000
I can disappear with Kaian.

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,479
You forged your identity in this bag.

19
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,720
in this bag.

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,680
You and Ji Jiang

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,880
are not Junteng's people.

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,479
You can't defeat me.

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,320
Xu Xi can't. Neither can you.

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,479
How dare you mention Xu Xi?

25
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,840
Do you think you can live a carefree life

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,960
with your dirty tricks?

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,240
Aren't you afraid of karma?

28
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,640
So what?

29
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,480
I have something on you. What can you do to me?

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,800
Chen Yalu.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,919
Living in this world every day

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,000
Aren't you tired?

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Leave Liu Kaian.

34
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,079
or you'll be doomed.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
You can show

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,560
to Liu Kaian.

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,440
If a person lies too much,

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
no one will believe me even if I tell the truth.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,440
But you've been lying.

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm going to the office this afternoon.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,960
If you're interested, expose me in person.

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,079
Mr. Liu, you really know how to do business.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
How dare you fake the contract?

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,440
Mr. Ji, calm down.

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,640
What happened?

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,760
If Kiki hadn't reminded me,

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
I wouldn't have known.

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,640
Xu Xi.

49
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,280
Your ex-wife

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,440
is the second largest shareholder of Kaixi Group.

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,240
She didn't sign the contract.

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
without her signature?

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,440
Do you know how risky this place is?

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,600
Liu Kaian.

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,920
Why didn't you tell me

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,440
Xu Xi has shares of the company?

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,160
Kiki, President Ji, let me explain.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,280
Xu Xi...

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,120
Also,

60
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,920
we agreed

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,400
We have

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,960
in the company account.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,320
Now, we have no money.

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Mr. Liu.

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,000
You really let

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,800
my trust in you.

67
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,640
Do you have any difficulties?

68
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Here's the thing.

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,200
The company's money

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
on the live streaming base.

71
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
I hope

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,240
we can land the project

73
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,640
the project can land as soon as possible.

74
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
The accounts are fabricated.

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,280
To be honest,

76
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,160
We won't work together.

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,640
But to be honest,

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,440
you'll pull me down.

79
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,520
How arrogant.

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,600
Liu Kaian.

81
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
I said you're stupid, but you didn't listen.

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
See for yourself.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,760
These two

84
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
have nothing to do with Junteng Group.

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,240
Who are you?

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,240
Let me tell you.

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
Let me introduce.

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
This is Junteng Group.

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,000
No need to introduce.

90
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,240
Let me tell you.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,360
He and her

92
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,960
has nothing to do

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,440
has nothing to do with my company.

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,880
What did I do to offend you?

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,960
You took my money in my name

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,080
in my name.

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,440
and get yourself involved.

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
Are you crazy?

99
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,440
Who are you to tell me what to do?

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,159
Because I'm your brother.

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,160
You're my only sister.

102
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,440
I don't want to see you.

103
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Stop!

104
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,680
Kiki.

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,600
Stop him.

106
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,280
You two

107
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,680
That's his sister.

108
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,640
Recently,

109
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,040
I accidentally

110
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,040
I made a few small goals.

111
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,560
I know it's hard for you.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,080
It's okay. Tell me.

113
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,600
I can help you anytime.

114
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,720
Don't worry. I'll let you know if you need help.

115
