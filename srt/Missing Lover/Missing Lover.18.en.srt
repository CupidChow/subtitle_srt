BAMORO 9ABOBOANVL7ION9E

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,320
I heard from Ah Lu that

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,280
she saw Xu Xi's ghost again.

5
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,480
What does that mean?

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,480
It's scary.

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,760
She's crazy and unreasonable.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,680
She's just worried that the world will be in chaos.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,920
Don't say that.

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,680
I think she's just emotionally unstable.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
She's under a lot of pressure.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
You should understand her.

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,680
I understand her.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
Who understands me?

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,360
Actually, I understand.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,920
what women fear most is being insecure.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,960
Don't mention Xu Xi in front of her.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,960
I...

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,640
try not to show up in front of her.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,560
It's not Kiki.

21
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,240
There's nothing between us.

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,280
Why do you care about what others think?

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,680
But what if

24
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,479
I really like you?

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
I...

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,080
I almost forgot the business.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,240
Mr. Ji told me something happened, right?

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,080
To be honest,

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,680
the base has been suspended.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,560
I’m worried every day.

31
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,120
The company is a mess

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
The house is a mess too.

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,120
Yes.

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,520
A man who wants to succeed

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
is afraid of family disagreement.

36
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm sorry. I'm not saying you won't succeed.

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,759
I mean...

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
You're right.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Here's 2 million won.

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,880
Listen to me first.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,480
Although this is just a little bit of money,

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,079
at least it can relieve the pain.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
President Ji

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,120
is trying to help you.

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,760
Kaian.

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,880
Let's put aside our feelings first.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,120
I help you

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,760
because I value your strength

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
and your potential.

50
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,360
When everything is over,

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,480
you'll make a great progress.

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,160
Trust me.

53
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,480
No, no.

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,880
I can't take the money.

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,760
You wish.

56
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,440
I lent you the money.

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,680
I'll pay you back double when you make money.

58
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,520
Are you a loan shark?

59
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,840
I'll spare your life.

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
Do you really think

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm afraid of you?

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,720
The most important thing is to move.

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,760
Don't stop.

64
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,320
Okay, go ahead.

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,120
Xie.

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,880
Here is 2 million.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,320
You know how to use it.

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,320
I know.

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,640
Where did you get the 2 million?

70
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,680
It's none of your business.

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm here to tell you

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,720
stay away from that Kiki.

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,840
Are you done?

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,920
I've thought about it these days.

75
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,320
Every time Kiki appears from the interview,

76
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,040
seems to be planned.

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
As soon as something haunted happened,

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,520
she appeared by my side with Xu Xi's voice.

79
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,120
Don't you think it's strange?

80
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,040
Don't be paranoid.

81
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
I know Kiki's voice better than you.

82
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,920
Of course, you must know her better than me.

83
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,399
But don't forget that Xu Xi learned to dub.

84
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,040
She's just missing.

85
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,200
No one has found out

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
She came back for revenge.

87
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,000
She wants to destroy us.

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,280
If she wants to destroy me,

89
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,760
she just needs to shut down the company.

90
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,080
as long as the company goes bankrupt.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,840
Why did she help me contact Junteng?

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,720
Why did she lend me money?

93
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,320
Have you really never been cheated?

94
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
You wouldn't fall for it if I didn't give you something.

95
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,560
I know her.

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,880
Trust me.

97
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,120
You must know.

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,240
That's what you did back then.

99
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,600
Liu Kaian.

100
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
You're not only a jerk, but also a moron.

101
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm sure

102
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
she will eat you up.

103
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Chen Yalu.

104
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,320
Don't affect me with your nerves.

105
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
Kiki is right.

106
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,520
The backyard is unstable.

107
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,200
Men are like dogs.

108
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,080
I will find out who she is.

109
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,840
I want you to kneel down and apologize.

110
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,560
I wish you success.

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,200
Get out. I don't want to see you.

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,840
I just want to take a look. What are you looking at?

115
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,720
What were you doing earlier?

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,080
Now you see her as your granddaughter.

117
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
I won't let you see it. Leave.

118
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,320
Let me have a look.

119
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,480

I'll leave.

Are you okay?

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,640
Your legs are already weak.

131
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,560
Why are you fighting with her?

132
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,200
