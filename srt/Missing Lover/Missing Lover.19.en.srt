1
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,080
A DI DE or 9A B OD AN VL 71 ON 9E.

2
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,040
BAMORO 9ABOANVL7ION9E

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:50,960
Kiki.

4
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,600
You haven't visited me for a long time.

5
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,240
I've been too busy these days.

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,360
I didn't have time to visit you.

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,760
How have you been?

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Don't mention it.

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,680
This house is a mess now

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,600
We used to be noisy

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,720
Now we're ignoring each other.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,600
If it weren't for my grandson,

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,200
I would have gone back to my hometown.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,720
Maybe it's my fault

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,200
because of me.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,080
Or I won't come again.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,640
Kiki, don't think like that.

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,400
Are you here to see me?

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,320
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Kiki is here to see me, so what?

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,800
I advise you

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,560
Don't bring such an unidentified person

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,600
to your home.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,960
You might get abducted too.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,039
Yale.

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
You can say that about me.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,280
But you can't say that about auntie.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,600
She's an elder after all.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,720
You two are united.

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,759
I've used this trick before.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,200
I advise you to disappear immediately.

32
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm leaving.

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm here.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
I'll see who dares to kick you out.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,360
Ignore her. My son will be back soon.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
Are you going to set them up?

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Yale.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,200
Kaian and I are not as dirty as you think.

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,199
You're the one being petty.

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,600
You feel uncomfortable watching others live well, right?

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,640
You think you're great

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,880
you think you are great.

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,200
Listen, no one

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,800
can take away my things.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Stay away from Liu Kaian.

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,680
What did you say?

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,720
What did I say?

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,680
you have to ask her.

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,200
Why don't you ask your son?

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,400
What's wrong with my son?

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
My son is fine.

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Yes.

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,320
Your son is fine, just like you.

54
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,920
He doesn't know what's right and what's wrong.

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,120
Let me tell you. I have a grandson.

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,520
I have the final say in this family.

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
I'm the hostess.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,320
Auntie!

59
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,680
Auntie.

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,680
Are you feeling better?

61
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,640
You scared us.

62
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,680
Let her go.

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,600
Get out.

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,800
Mom, don't be angry.

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't be angry.

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,480
Mom, what happened? Tell me.

67
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
She...

68
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,480
She pissed me off.

69
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Are you satisfied now?

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,800
Stop pretending. I know you did it on purpose.

71
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,000
What do you want?

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,280
There are things that don't have to be so clear.

73
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
They only trust me now.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
You can do whatever you want.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,520
Don't get cocky.

76
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,560
Because I won't let you.

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,680
Chen Yalu!

78
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,079
Don't go too far.

79
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
She didn't mean it.

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,840
It's none of your business.

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Didn't you hear what my mom said?

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,240
The elevator is over there.

83
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,040
Let's go.

84
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,880
Kaian.

85
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
I was there all the way.

86
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
Yale really didn't mean it.

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,240
She wants me to leave.

88
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
She's just protecting me.

89
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,200
Say no more.

90
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
My mom is my limit.

91
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
No one can touch her.

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
Let's not see each other again.

93
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,920
Kiki.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
I know what you're thinking.

95
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,040
I'm already helping you urge President Ji.

96
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Okay, I got it.

97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,800
Someone is looking into us.

98
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Chen Yalu?

99
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,600
We have to hurry up.

100
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,480
But recently, I think Kaian

101
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,400
Kaian.

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,040
Are you kidding me?

103
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,560
Are you softhearted?

104
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,760
Did I say anything?

105
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't act like you know me well.

106
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
You think you're smart.

107
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,120
You should thank me for being smart

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,880
for saving us a lot of trouble.

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,720
Chen Yalu was cornered.

110
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,600
Think about what will happen

111
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
what will she do next?

112
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,320
If Chen Yalu really investigated us,

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,920
her purpose is to expose us.

114
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,320
And

115
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,000
and take back the position in Liu Kai'an's heart.

116
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,080
She doesn't care about Liu Kaian.

117
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,400
She approached Liu Kaian because she was jealous of me.

118
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,320
and wanted Kaixi's shares.

119
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
Let's think about it.

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,920
This person may be Chen Yalu's LL.

121
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,600
If that's the case,

122
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,320
your Kaian's hair

123
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,800
is a little green.

124
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,080
Think about Chen Yalu's child.

125
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,400
How about this?

126
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,560
Let's do something

127
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Add one more piece for him.

128
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,280
Forget it.

129
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,920
I won't get involved in such disgusting things.

130
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,760
How did you switch

131
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
and softness?

132
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,560
with softness.

133
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,720
Kaian, where are you going?

134
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,200
Don't go!

135
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,960
Let go!

136
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,280
It wasn't Kaian. I didn't mean it.

137
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,200
Yes, it's Kiki's fault.

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,640
If it weren't for her,

139
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
this wouldn't have happened.

140
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,760
Yes, it's always someone else's fault.

141
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,080
You won't make mistakes, right?

142
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
No, I was wrong.

143
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,840
I know I was wrong.

144
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,080
Don't leave me, okay?

145
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,680
I'll apologize to our mom.

146
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,800
I'll kneel down.

147
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,360
As long as you can forgive me,

148
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,800
you know my limits.

149
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,800
Why don't you let me go today?

150
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,400
How about

151
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,480
get lost now?

152
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,560
I'll leave.

153
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,120
I'll take my son with me.

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm afraid your mother will be more upset.

155
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,720
It won't do you any good

156
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,960
to offend me.

157
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Don't forget how Xu Xi died.

158
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,480
If you push me too hard,

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,760
don't threaten me with your son.

160
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,480
Don't threaten me with Xu Xi.

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,280
You...

162
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,200
don't deserve to mention Xu Xi.

163
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,640
Liu Kaian.

164
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,320
We'll die together.

165
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,159
