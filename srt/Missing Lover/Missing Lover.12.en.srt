Hello, Mr. Chen.

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,120
Miss Kiki, I'll keep my dignity.

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080
Don't intervene in others' lives.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,600

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,560
Let me introduce myself.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,440
I'm the senior investment manager of Junteng Capital.

Kiki.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,640
I've been interested in Kaixi Entertainment for a long time.

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,440
I went for an interview

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,640
to test

20
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,000
Unfortunately, I didn't win your favor.

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,759
But I'm glad.

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,440
At least you are very strict in handling people.

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,160
It's so lively today.

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,479
Kiki.

25
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,640
Is this Mr. Liu and Mr. Chen

26
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,080
Mr. Liu and Mr. Chen?

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,720
Hmm.

28
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,840
This is the senior investor consultant of Junteng Capital,

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
and deputy general manager, Mr. Ji Jiang.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
Hello, President Ji.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,760
Mr. Chen, do you still think

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,440
with good intentions?

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,199
Miss Kiki, I'm really sorry.

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,759
I was too impulsive just now.

35
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,920
I apologize.

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,120
I'm not that...

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,640
"Ma" means interests.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
I won't give up

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,040
I won't give up even if I'm being chased.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,640
President Ji, Miss Kiki.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,640
So you really want to vote for Kaixi?

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Mr. Liu, to be honest,

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,800
If it weren't for Kiki's recommendation,

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,600
I don't know much about your company.

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Here's the thing.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,920
President Ji, Miss Kiki.

47
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,440
Today, let me introduce Kaixi.

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,600

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,200
Mr. Liu, today is the weekend.

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,640
Let's not talk about work.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Can we have a drink here?

52
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,920
Sure. Please.

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
President Ji, Miss Kiki, please support us.

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,200
Here.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,360
Yale, don't you want a title?

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,520
I'll give you all the shares and houses.

57
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,400
I told you

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,560
I, Liu Kaian,

59
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
a petty person.

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,480
It's just a matter of time.

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,320
Kaian, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
I was too sensitive.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,440
When are they coming to the office?

64
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,960
Tomorrow.

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,640
Yale, you should come tomorrow and dress up.

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
I'll definitely beat Kiki.

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,520
I haven't seen you so happy for a long time.

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,640
We don't hold a wedding.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,120
It's just a gathering of relatives and friends.

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,520
and let everyone see their new wife.

71
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,880
Chun Xiang, I have something to say.

72
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,400
What are you doing?

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,760
I haven't found my daughter-in-law yet.

74
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Another one.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,160
I'm going to poke you.

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm not going. That's it.

77
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,560
Hey.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,840
Mr. Ji, you can invest in it first.

79
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,040
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

80
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,000
This is our initial cooperation.

81
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
I always follow the rules.

82
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,240
I’ll get some money soon.

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,960
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

84
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,200
You're welcome.

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,519
You should thank Kiki.

86
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,160
I've never seen her

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,520
such a person.

88
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
I do value

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
Kaixi's potential and ability.

90
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,000
I really admire Miss Kiki.

91
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,600
She knows more about Kaixi than me.

92
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,840
Of course. Otherwise,

93
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
become a senior investment manager?

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,159
President Ji, Miss Kiki,

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,240
I've prepared a feast.

96
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,400
Please do me the honor.

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,520
Mr. Liu, here's the thing.

98
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,000
We have a rule.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we can't get too close to our partners.

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,600
However,

101
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Kiki can go.

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,640
Then I'll do as you say.

103
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
Have some tea.

104
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,560
Thank you.

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm so full

106
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Your cooking is amazing.

107
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,000
No, it's just some home-cooked dishes.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
My name is Kaian, a big hotel.

109

110

It's the best treat.

111

I don't know.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
Anyway, I'm happy that you can eat well.

113
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
Just call me Kiki from now on.

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,160
You too.

115
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
Don't be so polite. Just call me by my real name.

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Okay, you can call us by our name too.

117
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Since we're friends, don't be so distant.

118
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,280
Be closer.

119
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Yes, it's better to be closer.

120
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,080
I'll cut some fruits.

121
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay.

122
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,320
Thank you.

123
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,159
Kaian, when I came to your house,

124
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,640
I know why you are so excellent.

127

You told me that men's ideals

128
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,720
That's all.

129
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm satisfied anyway.

130

He never talked to me.

132
