3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
You're here.

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,960
Aunt asked me to get something for her.

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,120
It's all ready.

6
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,920
Are you okay?

7
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,920
I'm fine.

8
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,800
Lost.

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,720
I feel relieved.

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,720
I lost.

11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm tired too.

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,800
Are you here to avenge Xu Xi

13
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,160
or do you really love Liu Kaian?

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,120
Both.

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
What about you?

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,440
At least I don't love him anymore.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,720
He is not a good husband

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,080
nor a good lover.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
Sometimes,

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,800
I'm not even a man.

21
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,880
What about Xu Xi?

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Xu Xi.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,120
Xu Xi.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,520
She is a good woman

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,479
and a good friend.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,160
But I was jealous of her excellence.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
But she doesn't know

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,000
She always spoiled me.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,400
I always took her things when I was in school.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,400
steal her new clothes and new phones.

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,920
and her milk tea.

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,400
Once I asked her

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,360
if I steal your man one day,

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,720
will you spoil me too?

35
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
Guess what she said.

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
It's yours.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
I don't want a man who can be taken away from me.

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,320
You already knew

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
you already knew

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm your brother's friend.

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,360
Even Liu Kaian doesn't know

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,760
You have such a big brother.

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,280
You've hidden it well.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
What's wrong with you and your brother?

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
Fight when we meet.

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,360
I'm Lu Qing.

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,680
When I was very young,

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,200
my dad left us with my brother.

49
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,000
I took after my mom's surname and changed my name to Xu Xi.

50
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,520
When my dad passed away,

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,320
he called me brother, no matter what,

52
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,880
take care of me and my mom.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
But I hate my dad.

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,160
I hated him for abandoning us.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,200
So I don't want to see my brother.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Me too.

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Cheers.

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
How much do you want?

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
5 million.

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,480
5 million

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,960
Not much.

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
But...

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
how are you going to pay me back?

64
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
I want it for your son.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
Why?

66
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,120
If you don't believe me,

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,760
if you don't believe me.

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,520
Don't forget our promise.

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm leaving.

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,640
If Liu Kaian doesn't give you pocket money,

71
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,120
I can give it to you.

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,640
Yale.

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,960
I've been through so much.

74
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,159
Do you think

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
you can threaten me?

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,520
But the child is yours.

77
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,960
I came to see you at the right time.

78
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,120
Let me tell you again.

79
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
I've been through too much.

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,400
I've calculated the time.

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,720
I've died 80 times.

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,520
How about this?

83
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,440
I'll give you 500,000.

84
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
Don't come to me again.

85
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,080
Zhao,

86
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,680
Since you turn your back on me,

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,240
don't blame me for being caught.

88
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,760
Okay, I got it.

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,920
Really?

90
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,920
Mr. Zhao.

91
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,040
I know you and Mr. Lu are best friends.

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,760
I have no choice

93
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,040
to ask for your help.

94
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Mr. Liu.

95
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,840
You still owe me money.

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,920
I can't help you this time.

97
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,320
Besides, what can I get?

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,840
Mr. Zhao, I helped you before.

99
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,520
You can't turn your back on me.

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,920
Besides, I've always remembered your kindness.

101
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,880
Please do her a favor.

102
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,080
What do you two want?

103
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,280
One wants my help,

104
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,640
and the other threatened me with the child.

105
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
One is red-faced and the other is white-faced.

106
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,960
Do you think I'm an idiot?

107
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Kid.

108
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
What child?

109
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,920
I know it's hard for you.

110
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
I don't want the money you owe me.

111
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,159
I've done my best.

112
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
As for whether Chen Yalu's child

113
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,159
is your son,

114
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,880
You guys deal with it yourselves.

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,320
