00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,040
Honey.

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,240
Wake up!

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,880
Don't scare me.

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,640
Honey, wake up.

7
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,680
Xu Xi...

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,640
Kaian.

9
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,280
It was an accident.

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,480
Calm down.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
Calm down.

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,400
Yes.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,480
Call an ambulance.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,360
Call the police.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
No.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,840
Kaian.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Don't call the police.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,000
It'll be hard to explain if the police come.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,920
Chen Yalu, what time is it?

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,280
Are you crazy?

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,720
You're the crazy one.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If anything happens to you, I'll become an orphan.

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,759
Who will take care of your mom?

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
The company is waiting for you to eat.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,400
Listen to me.

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,440
We've never been here.

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,200
Let's go. No one will know.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,160
Let's go.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,000
Listen to me.

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,600
Go!

31
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,520
Mom.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,920
Yi Yi, grandma is here. Don't cry.

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,120
What's wrong with the baby?

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,640
It's okay

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,600
Mommy will be back soon.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,840
Good girl, Yi Yi.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,880
Let's go. As long as we don't tell them,

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,000
no one knows we've been here.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,639
This has nothing to do with us.

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,080
I have to go back.

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,160
Liu Kaian, are you crazy?

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,200
You can't go back.

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,560
I can't leave Xu Xi.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,600
You'll go to jail.

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,360
Come back.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,400
120?

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,520
Someone fainted.

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,960
Where is she?

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Wenxi.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
Wenxi.

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
She must be swept away by the tide.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,200
What are you doing?

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Instead of explaining clearly,

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,120
than make it obvious.

55
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Listen to me. Calm down.

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,240
No one saw her today.

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,400
Do as I say tomorrow.

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
You must emphasize that after she had a miscarriage,

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,480
after abortion.

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
and tendency to commit suicide.

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,000
Mrs. Chen, don't worry.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,320
Wenxi, she'll be fine.

63
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,160
She's not usually like this.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,640
She gave me a message and left.

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,320
He didn't answer my calls.

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,200
I was in a hurry.

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Kaian.

68
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
Kaian.

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,320
Mom.

70
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,520
Let me ask you.

71
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,079
Did you two have a fight?

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
No.

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,080
No. How could she be like this?

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
Mom, don't worry.

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,760
I'll definitely get Wenxi back.

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
Mrs. Chen, it's okay.

77
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
It's okay.

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,600
The patient's brain is severely damaged.

79
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,399
He can't wake up for a while.

80
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,880
or never wake up.

81
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,480
I see.

82
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,600
Look at the two at the back.

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,560
You help them too.

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,480
Move over there.

85
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,280
About Xu Xi,

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Let bygones be bygones.

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,720
Stop being dispirited.

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,720
There's something important in the company.

89
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,520
Everyone is waiting for your decision.

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,720
Go back to the company tomorrow.

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,280
The market has changed recently.

92
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,440
We should be more sensitive. Besides,

93
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,160
Mr Chen, I think he ate something bad yesterday.

94
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,480
Let's continue.

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,520
