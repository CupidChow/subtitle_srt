Let's go.

172
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,460
Check it out.

173
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,000
(A villager of Hexi Village, Zhu Ping)
Check it out.

174
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,100
(A villager of Hexi Village, Zhu Ping)

175
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,120
Thank you for saving me.

176
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,240
Otherwise, I might get beaten up again.

177
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Don't you remember me?

178
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,320
Me?

179
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:06,920
Well,

180
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,280
it was in that bush.

181
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,680
Two people from two villages met

182
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,480
and fought.

183
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,840
And you whispered to me

184
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,120
that they were going to fight.

185
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,760
Did you get

186
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,480
this cut on your head from then?

187
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,320
Thank you for what you did.

188
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

189
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,560
We're even now.

190
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
I have to go now.

191
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,400
It's getting dark.

192
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,560
Where are you going?

193
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,680
Are you not afraid?

194
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,560
Afraid?

195
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,880
Compared to you humans...

196
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,920
I mean,

197
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,680
the brutal people

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
in your village

199
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,280
are scarier.

200
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,280
That's why I escaped.

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,600
I don't know what

202
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,520
they're fighting about every day.

203
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,600
And your village.

204
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
You can't even finish the river water.

205
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,400
Why not share it together?

206
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,240
What's there to argue about?

207
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,960
You are quite interesting.

208
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
Unlike a human being.

209
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,920
Is that a compliment?

210
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,920
My name is Zhu Ping.

211
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,840
What's your name?

212
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,440
My name?

213
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,280
I...

214
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
I'm hungry.
