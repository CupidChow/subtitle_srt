and has no choice.

97

98

they'll all die.

Zhu Ping.

100

Zhu Ping.

101

I knew you would come.

It's me, little fox.

104

I am Zhu Ping.

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,880
I knew something is off
about this village.

106
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
So there is an evil spirit.

107

Don't tarnish Zhu Ping.

Although I don't look like one,

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,440
I like

a nice kid with a pure heart.

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920

your friends well, too.

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,440
See for yourself.

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,240
You and that little fox

118
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,720
are quite attached.

119
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,200
Did you let him go on purpose?

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,400
Elder Qu.

121
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,960
You are the leader.

122
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,000
Please convince everyone

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,800
to let him go.

124
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
Why are you protecting

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,360
a demon?

126
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,600
He is my friend.

127
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,840
Nonsense.

128
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
You two are different.

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,200
How can you possibly be friends?

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,040
Demons are greedy and despicable.

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
They have ulterior motives.

132
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,720
Not all demons are like that.

133
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,200
Are you sure about that?

134
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,440
How many demons have you seen?

135
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
What do you think

136
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
of a demon like me

137
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,600
who feeds on hostility?

138
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
Do you know

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
how long it took me

140
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,160
to start a fight

141
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,080

through that little fox.

I also found you in the village.

isn't going to live much longer either.

149

I happen to be looking
for a suitable host.

150
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,520
Now you've come to me.

How dare you?

152

Can't bear to do it?

What do you want to let Zhu Ping go?

Your skin is pure

and you have strong demonic power.

I like you better.
