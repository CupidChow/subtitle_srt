The fox must have caused trouble.

I kill you.

What took you so long?

I fell asleep waiting for you.

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,960
I went to kill the chicken.

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,200
See clearly.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,440
They are enjoying drinking

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,200
and eating chicken.

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
You'll spoil the fun

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,640
by making a scene here.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,040
What a good liquor.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,880
It's not as amazing

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
as your wheat bread,

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,200
but it's the best

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,280
I could find.

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
I stole it from
the village chief's house.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,960
I put up with it for a whole day.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,600
Stealing is wrong.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,960
Drumstick.

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,200
Yummy.

37
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,600
This is a purebred grouse.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,440
I almost turned into

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,640
my original form trying to catch it.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,640
What?

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,360
I almost got caught.

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
This liquor is so strong.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,280
My tongue feels numb.

00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,680
Stay alert, everyone!

46
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,840
Don't let the people of
Hedong Village raise a ruckus.

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,920
- Hurry.
- Master Shen.

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,920
I just saw

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,040
Zhu Ping and a kid

50
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,880
from Hedong Village

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,000
eating chicken by the river.

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
How dare he eats on our territory?

53
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,240
I will give him a good lesson.

54
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,860
Okay.

55
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,320
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,000
My tea.

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,200
What is tea?

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,240
This is the tea I made.

59
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,400
Would you like some?

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
I think this would

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,080
taste great in liquor.

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Stop it.

63
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,480
Liquor and tea are two different things.

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,920
They cannot be mixed together.

65
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,680
We are different, too.

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
I mean, we're from
two different villages,

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
but we can still be friends.

68
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,720
Who cares?

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,040
As long as we are happy.

70
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,760
You are right.

71
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,040
Here.

72
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,680
Here's to our future.

73
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
May it be bright and prosperous.

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,080
I'm not as civilised as you are.

75
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,680
May we have limitless food,

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
liquor

77
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,880
and the village chief's chickens.

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,680
I vow not to lose my faith.

79
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,520
Okay.

80
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Cheers.

81
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,640
Be careful!

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Calm down.

83
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,200
It's him.

84
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,360
Don't hurt him.

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,200
He is my friend.

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,880
Get out of the way.

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,320
Friend?

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,160
You traitor.

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,840
If you don't scram,

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,840
I'll kill you too.

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,880
He's not a bad guy.

92
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,600
Trust me.

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,320
He did not take part in the river raid.

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,600
He is from Hedong Village.

95
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Anyone who dares to
trespass on our land

96
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,480
should die.

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,040
Cut the talk.

98
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,520
Brat, take this!

99
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
Let's go.

100
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,480
Demon!

101
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,800
Run.

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,960
Why did you stop me?

103
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,320
Busybody.

104
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,680
You were ready to use your power.

105
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,840
Even if I didn't step in,
you would have.

106
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,880
Very funny.

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
You made it up.

108
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,360
See?

109
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,360
I told you.

110
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,600
The fox won't hurt humans.

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,920
It's too early to say.

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,240
Listen.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,920
Demons are just evil

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,920
and have no sincerity.

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,680
I think we lost them.

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,000
Several people

117
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,240
died in this cottage before.

118
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,000
Usually, no one dares to come.

119
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
We are safe for now.

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,440
You are badly hurt.

121
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,440
I have an ancestral remedy

122
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
that will help you heal.

123
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,040
However,

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
it can't be seen by outsiders.

125
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,680
So

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,640
you'll have to close your eyes

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,680
while I heal your wound.

128
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,000
What ancestral remedy?

129
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,200
Why so mysterious?

130
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,920
You are

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,200
not going to

132
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,240
piss on my hand, are you?

133
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,080
Shut up.

134
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Shut your eyes.

135
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,680
Done.

136
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,280
Are you a deity?

137
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,480
How did you do it?

138
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,360
Silly.

139
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm not a deity.

140
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,840
You're a bit of a nutcase.

141
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:41,840
How are you going to

142
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,880
return to your village?

143
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,040
Those guys

144
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,000
all think you're a traitor.

145
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,600
How else will you get along?

146
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,880
They often

147
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,760
use violence.

148
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,600
I never wanted to get along with them.

149
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,800
How about this?

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,200
I'll make up a story for you.

151
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,720
Tell them

152
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
I am a demon.

153
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
And that you were

154
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,680
compelled to stay with me.

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,960
Let's not

156
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,320
see each other again.

157
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,960
That is

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,480
a scary thing to hear.

159
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,960
I'm not sure about it.

160
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Once I've used this secret remedy,

161
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,480
I really

162
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
can't see you anymore.

163
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,960
To be frank,

164
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
I'm afraid

165
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,800
you'll come after my secret remedy.

166
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,560
Bye.

167
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,800
Hu Shen.

168
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,440
Go back in.

169
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,280
Are we

170
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
really not going to
see each other anymore?

171
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,040
Well,

172
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,560
I haven't had enough of the liquor

173
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
from your village chief's house.

174
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,480
Don't act like a girl.

175
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,280
We've only had a few drinks.

176
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,840
You don't even know who I am.

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,040
Maybe you'll hate me

178
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,520
when you get to know me better.

179
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,680
I know who you are.

180
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,360
You are my friend.

181
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,400
I will

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
never hate you.

183
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
One day,

184
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,080
we will meet again.

185
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
When I see you again,

186
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
I'll bring wheat bread and tea.

187
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
And you'll bring chicken and liquor.

188
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,160
(I, a fox,)

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,680
(used my inner power to heal)

190
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,680
(your deep wound)

191
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,400
(and it will be difficult to maintain
human form in the short term.)

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
(When you see me again,)

193
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,800
(you won't recognise me
either, you idiot.)

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,440
(However,)

195
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
(I will recognise you.)

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,720
What are you doing?

197
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Let me go.

198
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,520
Chief.

199
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,880
The kid from Hedong Village

200
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,800
is too wicked.

201
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,440
Just now when we went to catch him,

202
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,680
my hook

203
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,560
was hanging in the air.

204
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,000
I couldn't move it.

205
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,780
Something is indeed odd
in Hedong Village.

206
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,060
(Hexi Village's sage, Qu Jiang)

207
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,600
(Hexi Village's sage, Qu Jiang)
The people in their village

208
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,720
(Hexi Village's sage, Qu Jiang)
are all bad.

209
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,060
(Hexi Village's sage, Qu Jiang)

210
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,520
Exactly.

211
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:51,920
Elder Qu.

212
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,240
You're our leader.

213
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,400
Tell us your thoughts

214
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,640
on how to deal with Zhu Ping.

215
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,480
I spotted him

216
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,880
as soon as he sneaked

217
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,920
into the village.

218
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
How dare you come back, you traitor!

219
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
He's not a bad guy.

220
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,360
Trust me.

221
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,200
Nonsense.

222
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Look.

223
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,120
Master Shen injured me
with an arrow before.

224
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,480
That kid healed me.

225
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,880
Elder Qu.

226
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,040
Everyone listens to you.

227
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,840
Say something.

228
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,720
Why did you guys

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,440
hurt your own people?

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
Show me.

231
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,680
Demon.

232
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,120
