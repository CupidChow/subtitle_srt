Vintners nowadays are so desperate.

64

before you opened this bar?

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,480
You keep talking about demons.

70
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,280
This is a harmonious society.

71
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,680
No rumours.

72
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,800
No superstition.

73
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,920
Do you know why

74
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,320
this place is called the Demon Tavern?

75
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,960
I read a book before.

76
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,800
There was a line in it

77
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,760
that I particularly liked.

78
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
A demon

79
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,520
is a creature who seeks but cannot find.

80
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,240
If you don't believe me,
look behind you.

81
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,440
Observe carefully.

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,200
Nonsense.

83
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,240

84
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,840

85
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,040
This is...

86
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,320
Am I having

87
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,400
bogus liquor?

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,880
See?

89
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,200
Am I having bogus liquor?

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,120
What did you say?

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,880
I'm talking about you.

92
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,040
You are making no sense.

93
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Demons?

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,240
Seek but not find?

95
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,960
What about me?

96
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
What kind of demon am I?

97
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
You?

98
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,280
You are too paranoid

99
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
to be a demon

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,400
and you are too temperamental

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
to be human.

102
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,920
So you are now

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
half-human and half-demon.

104
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,000
In short,

105
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:18,959
human-demon.

110
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
I heard that the owner

111
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,280
can make a drink

112
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
that brings people into a dream.

113
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,280
I want the kind

114
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,520
that makes me dive into a sweet dream.

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,720
It's not always a sweet dream.

116
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,000
You have to be careful.

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,920
Don't dream of

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,160
a nightmare with

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,040
all those creepy demons.

120
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
That's horrifying.

121
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,080
And I don't think

122
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
it's a good idea to drink

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,360
with your eyes condition.

124
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,280
I had poor eyesight since I was a child.

125
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,320
The other eye is almost blind, too.

126
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,640
It doesn't matter to me.

127
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
But I have a friend

128
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,360
I haven't seen in 12 years.

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,520
If possible,

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
I would like to see him in my dream.

131
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,760
Leave it to me.

132
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,560
Why do you take on

133
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,480
all kinds of work?

134
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,680
However, you need to

135
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,240
make this liquor with me.

136
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,640
What is your impression of him?

137
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
He is about my age.

138
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,160
He's a very gentle person.

139
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
He would always send me

140
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
wheat breads and tea from his village.

141
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm drooling just thinking about it.

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,760
We are both very busy.

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,520
We haven't seen each other for years.

144
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,560
I often think of him,

145
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,320
but there's always

146
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,240
something missing in the memory.

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
What are you doing?

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,080
Not bad.

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,560
You picked such a fine liquor.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
Rich and mellow.

151
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,800
Hey.

152
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,000
I picked this liquor first.

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,200
Take your hands off.

154
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,280
This liquor is very fruity.

155
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
You should not add too many

156
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,200
additional ingredients.

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,880
I know what I'm doing.

158
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,080
I sense that

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,680
you guys are very good friends.

160
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,200
- Impossible.
- Impossible.

161
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,680
What is that?

162
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,720
Hallucinogen?

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know you lost your job after
losing your sense of taste,

164
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,800
but don't come ruining my business,

165
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,560
okay?

166
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,760
You know what?

167
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,880
You are so annoying.

168
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,280
What exactly is this?

Why don't you try it?

171
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,520
Why?

172
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,440
Too chicken to drink?

173
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,800
Nonsense.

174
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,440
Fine.

175
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,480
Let's drink together.

176
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,720
Cheers.

177
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,960
Come on.

178
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,160
It's thundering.

(No, I have to run.)

184
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,480
(You have no way to run.)

185
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,360
(You don't have to be so serious.)

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,920
(Please.)

187
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,320
(Take it easy.)

(in the middle of a thunderstorm.)

192
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
(I'm just saying.)

193
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,600
(It doesn't really have to be this bad.)

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,280
(What is this?)

195
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,400
(He's dead.)

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,520
(Whatever.)

197

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,700
(Hu Shen)

202
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,920
(Hu Shen?)

203
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Fortunately, he just died recently.

204
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,280
There is still
the smell of a human body.

205
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,400
With this body,

206
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,480
there's nothing

207
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,320
God can do about me for now.

208
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,960
How about me? What will I do with you?

209
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,880
Master.

210
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,680
Why are you still chasing me?

211
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm just a little fox.

212
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
I'm not evil.

213
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,280
You are a demon.

214
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,400
All demons in this world

215
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,400
are evil.

216
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,040
So they must die.
