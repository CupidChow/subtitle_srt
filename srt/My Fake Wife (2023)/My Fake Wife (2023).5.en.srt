2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,080
You don't need to manage
this corporation anymore.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,000
You old man.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,480
You should have retired long ago.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,400
Grandpa, why weren't you careful?

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,760
Without you,

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,920
what will happen to Leng Corp?

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,000
Shut up, stop your nonsense.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,080
Zhixing.

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Doctor, how is my grandpa?

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,560
His life is not in danger at the moment.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
But it depends on his fate

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,680
when he can wake up.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,760
This will was signed by Grandpa.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Once any mishaps happens to him,

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,720
this will immediately takes effect.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,080
For the sake of Grandpa's
harmony in brotherhood,

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,000
I've endured you up until today.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,920
Since you don't want the easy way out,

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,200
then don't blame me
for being discourteous.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,720
Hello?

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,400
What did you say?

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,840
There is a problem with that land?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
We have to move
the ancestral graves of two villages.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,760
I don't care about ancestral graves!

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,440
If they don't move it,

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,520
then dig them out.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,840
Zhixing. Zhixing.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
You're finally back.

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,160
Did something happen?

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,720
Was that plot of land where Gao Village is?

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,560
My mother's grave is there.

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
That Leng Jiaxuan went mad
and wants to dig up the graves.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,480
How did you know?

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,800
My father called me just now

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
and asked me to think of something.

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,520
Don't panic, Miaomiao.

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,620
I'll take you there and have a look.

39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,620
Okay.

40
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,560
I want to pay my respects to my mother too.

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
Your mother must be very beautiful.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,760
Yes.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,760
My mother was very pretty.

44
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,800
But she was sent to the mental hospital

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,520
when I was very young.

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,200
I'll show you a photo of her.

47
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,160
This photo was taken during
the only time she visited me.

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,120
Then six years ago,

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,960
she died in a car accident.

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,680
Uncle Chen,

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,720
why?

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
Why would they discharge

53
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,760
a mentally ill patient and let her drive

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,720
to harm others?

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
Zhixing, what's wrong? Zhixing.

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,200
Drop her off.

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,280
Stop the car.

58
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,280
Get out of the car.

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,680
Send someone to take Miaomiao
back to college.

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,240
Of course.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,240
Luo Tian,

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,720
prepare to breach the contract

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,000
on the project at Gao Village.

64
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,720
Boss, why?

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
If we breach the contract now,

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,800
we have to compensate double the penalty.

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,520
Besides, didn't you say

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,240
this project

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,720
is trap made for Leng Jiaxuan?

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,760
That land is at risk of subsidence.

71
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,600
Besides, I cannot allow him
to touch the grave of Miaomiao's mother.

72
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Are you really sure?

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Just do it.

74
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,140
(What happened? Can you explain?)

75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
(Xia Miaomiao, I'm sorry.)

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
(Your mother killed my parents.)

77
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
(It's over between us.)

78
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,800
(Once I hear your voice,)

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
(I can't help but wish to be with you.)

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,320
Miaomiao.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,440
Miaomiao.

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
I heard Leng Zhixing wants to divorce you.

83
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,120
I'll go teach that guy a lesson.

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,830
Forget it.

85
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,680
Don't ruin your relationship
because of me.

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
My cousin

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,680
started to have a terrible temper

88
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,160
after his parents died and he became lame.

89
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,400
He always puts on a straight face.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
But Gandpa likes him.

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,480
Grandpa pities him.

92
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
If only that mental hospital

93
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
didn't let that patient out

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,520
to drive and hit his parents,

95
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,720
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,600
Did you say Leng Zhixing's parents

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
were killed by a mental patient
in an accident?

98
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,400
Yeah.

99
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080

Jiangcheng Mental Hospital.
