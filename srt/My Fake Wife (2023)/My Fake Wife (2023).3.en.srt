=Episode 3=

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,760
Ouch!

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,040
Who told you to sleep here?

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,680
(No good deed goes unpunished indeed.)

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,280
I must have slept through
the entire night, didn't I?

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,480
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm not used to
sleeping with another person.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,720
Give me your hand.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,280
You have severe insomnia.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,680
I'll help you treat it from now on.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,240
This medicine bag
must have worked last night.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,160
I'll make a few more, okay?

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,240
Today is Grandpa's birthday.
We're going to the house.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,680
Must I go?

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,920
Yes.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,760
You must be Jingxi.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,160
Zhixing has turned 30 this year

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,560
and finally has a family.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,800
Come here.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,200
Let me take a look at you.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,800
Jingxi.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,280
Jingxi.

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,880
Come with me.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,920
This document details the 5% equity
of the Leng family.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,080
All daughters-in-law of the
Leng family get a share.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,760
(Equity Transfer Agreement)
Sign this.

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,280
I'm sorry, Grandpa. I lied.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,320
I'm not Xia Jingxi.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm the Xia family's adopted daughter,

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,360
my name is Xia Miaomiao.

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,640
Preposterous!
I knew you didn't look like her.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,920
How could you take marriage for a game?

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,040
Grandpa, don't be angry.

34
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,000
Grandpa!

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,640
Happy birthday.

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,240
Who did this?

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
Who scammed us of this marriage?

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,600
It's her fault.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,800
She is an ingrate.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,040
We adopted her out of kindness,

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,640
but she confused us so she could marry

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,560
into the Leng family.

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
She even stole Jingxi's place.

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,880
I didn't. Dad.

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,160
Zhixing, you must believe me.

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,000
Zhixing, we didn't mean to substitute her.

47
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,360
Blame it on this dreadful girl
for this trouble.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,440
Don't call me that.

49
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,560
Did you think everyone is blind

50
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,000
like you?

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,200
Grandpa,

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,400
look at this video.

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,720
(My Jingxi is so smart,)

54
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
(you even fooled me.)

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm your woman.

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,080
How could I marry that cripple?

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,080
You rascal, how could you
do something like this?

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,880
Grandpa, Xia Miaomiao
has already married into the family.

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,480
It's too late now.

60
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,640
Besides, you've always been biased
towards Leng Zhixing for 28 years.

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,440
What else can I do?

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
You...

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,400
Chairman Leng.

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,440
Grandpa!

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,800
Call an ambulance.

66
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,680
Grandpa's condition looks far from good.

67
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,640
I'll treat him first.

68
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,440
What are you doing?

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,440
Wait.

70
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,600
Leng Zhixing, are you going
to leave Grandpa in her hands?

71
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,360
Xia family won't be responsible for this.

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,800
If you caused his death with your skills,

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
don't ever tell anyone
you're from the Xia family.

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
I know you perform well academically,

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
but you're still young.

76
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,720
Don't try to show off.

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,120
Don't cause any more troubles.

78
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Shut up, all of you.

79
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,960
I'll take responsibility.

80
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,280
Miaomiao, I trust you.

81
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,440
Who gave first aid just now?

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,120
I did.

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,000
Miss, you did very well.

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
The old man's life is not in danger.

85
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,920
Your judgment was precise.
I'm sure you'll have a bright future.

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Someone got blind luck.

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,760
Who got blind? Who got lucky?

88
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,840
Get out.

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
Grandpa, please calm down. I'll leave.

90
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,560
Grandpa.

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,640
You shielded her.

92
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,080
You shielded her, you get out too!

93
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,720
Fine, let's not talk about this.

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,040
Zhixing,

95
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,880
your eldest brother died too soon.

96
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
The future of Leng Corp
rests on you and Jiaxuan.

97
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,320
Whoever can reach

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,840
a cooperation with Dihao Corporation,

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,320
he will become Leng Corp's president.

100
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
I hope you won't disappoint me.

101
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
I know.

102
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,640
Their president Mo Sinian

103
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,760
is very mysterious.

104
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,440
Maybe he got disfigured.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,760
That's why he always wears a mask.

106
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,000
I've never met him before.

107
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,800
He has a CEO under him, Luo Tian.

108
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,280
You may contact him.

109
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,720
Don't worry and rest, Grandpa.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,720
Just leave Dihao Corporation's deal to me.

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,720
Miaomiao,

112
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,280
I'll send you back to college.

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
Thank you, Zhixing.

114
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,440
Miaomiao, call me
if anything happens in college.

115
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
I know, Zhixing.

116
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I'll go inside now.

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,800
Okay.

118
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Miaomiao?

119
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,280
Miaomiao.

120
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,200
Where have you been?

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,520
Yuhang,

122
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,480
we can't be together.

123
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,840
Miaomiao, I'll wait for you

124
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
until you agree.

125
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,880
But I'm already married.

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Impossible. Impossible!

127
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
I married the second son
of the Leng family.

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
You married my cousin?

129
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,600
Leng Zhixing

130
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,560
is your cousin?

131
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,880
I'll take you away.

132
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,000
I cannot let you waste your youth.

133
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,440
We'll go far away.

134
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,160
Stop it.

135
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,920
I like him, not you.

136
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Xia Miaomiao,

137
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,200
you're so shameless.

138
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,160
Don't pester my Yuhang
as soon as you come back.

139
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,480
Get away from me.

140
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,480
I...

141
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,680
Miaomiao.

142
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,600
