2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,480
Miaomiao, Zhixing.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,400
You're here.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,280
Hey, did you invite President Mo?

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,440
He isn't free today.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,240
Xia Miaomiao,

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,920
you're as shameless as your mother.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,280
You two steal others' husband.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,920
I'm the woman
Leng Zhixing wanted to marry.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,720
Shut up.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,960
Nonsense.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,720
Take her away.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,040
How could you slap my daughter?

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,760
- You would protect this illegitimate child.
- Who are you calling illegitimate?

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,840
Illegitimate, illegitimate.
Xia Zhengnan's illegitimate child!

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,040
That's what you are!

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,120
Go away.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,960
What is this?

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,440
You won't admit it?

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,760
She is yours and Gao Xiaolan's
biological daughter.

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,480
That's why you're so biased, am I right?

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,280
Is she telling the truth?

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,480
Yes or no?

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,120
It's not true.

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,360
Xia Miaomiao is your half-sister.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,840
She is Xia Zhengnan's
illegitimate daughter.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,600
That's impossible.

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,440
Why else do you think
Xia Miaomiao's mother

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,360
would die?

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,440
Six years ago, Xia Zhengnan and I
planned the car accident

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,040
to protect his reputation and properties.

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,960
He killed to silence her.

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,800
So, Xia Jingxi,

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,520
you are not destined to get Xia Corp.

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
You're on your own.

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,360
Impossible.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Xia Miaomiao.

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Xia Zhengnan.

39
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,560
Explain it to me.

40
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,840
Miaomiao, let me explain.

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,560
This matter is actually...

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,120
What a show.

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
Xia Zhengnan,

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,040
aren't you hypocritical?

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
For your own reputation,

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,400
you wouldn't even acknowledge
your own daughter!

47
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
You, you, you...

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,480
And you're hosting a charity dinner?

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
How ridiculous.

50
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,840
Who are you?

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,040
Oh, it's you.

52
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,620
So?

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,160
Do you remember now?

54
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,680
Aren't you dead?

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,680
How are you still alive?

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Are you scared?

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,480
You look just like your mother.

58
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
You've seen her?

59
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
Six years ago,

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
he gave me a large sum of money

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
to spoil the car's brake pads

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,080
and get your mother in the car.

63
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,320
And then...

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,640
Boom!

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,440
In both cars,

66
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,600
were the dead and injured.

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,880
Xia Zhengnan

68
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,620
was the mastermind behind this.

69
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,720
He is spouting nonsense,
don't believe him.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He is crazy.

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,240
But you abandoned me after the deed.

72
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,320
You even

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,480
got someone to kill me.

74
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,400
You burned my house

75
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,840
into ashes.

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,600
My wife and children

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
died in the fire.

78
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,560
I...

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
I turned into this monster.

80
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Xia Zhengnan,

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
you deserve to die.

82
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,400
Zhixing, are you okay?

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,720
I'm fine.

84
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,880
A life for a life.

85
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,400
I will surrender myself to the police now.

86
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,720
Dad!

87
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,160
Zhengnan.

88
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Call an ambulance.

89
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,520
Hurry, call an ambulance.

90
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,080
Dad.

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,400
Miaomiao,

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,680
your father is dying

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
and has transferred to the general ward.

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
He wants to see you one last time.

95
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,200
I don't have a father.

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
Leave. I don't want to see him.

97
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,040
Miaomiao.

98
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,840
Go to him.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You want me to go?

100
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480
I'm afraid you will regret it

101
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
if you don't go.

102
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,880
Miaomiao,

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,840
I let your mother down.

104
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,880
I let you down.

105
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,440
There is no one else here.

106
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,920
You don't need to be pretentious.

107
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,200
When one is at death's door,

108
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,360
his words are true.

109
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,920
I won't beg you to forgive me.

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,680
I only beg you

111
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,440
to save Xia Corp

112
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080
and save Jingxi.
