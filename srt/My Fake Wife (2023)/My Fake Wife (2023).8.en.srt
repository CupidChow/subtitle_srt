=Episode 8=

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,160
Miaomiao,

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,400
the professor said
you'll be the representative

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,960
to reveal the project team with the person
in charge of Leng Medical.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,120
Come and get ready with me.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,400
(Zhixing.)

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,480
Okay.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,440
That's for seducing Yuhang.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,880
This is the hotel kitchen's
dedicated ice room.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,160
Just stay inside and chill out.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,080
Du Siyu.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,720
Open this door, Du Siyu.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,840
Let's go.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,240
Du Siyu, open the door.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,800
Where is Miaomiao?

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,680
Didn't she go backstage to find you?

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,560
Do you realize this is the Du's property?

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,680
I...

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,000
Hello, Luo Tian.

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,360
Check the surveillance cameras, now.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Boss, she is at the ice room.

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,400
Remember to put on your mask.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,690
The truth about your legs'
full recovery cannot be exposed.

24
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,800
Sorry, sir.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,040
We don't have rooms available.

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,080
Hurry.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,000
Miss Du said

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,320
we cannot allow this woman into the hotel.

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,240
Look, I'm begging you.

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,200
Get a room card now.

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,120
If you delay another second,

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,080
both the miss

33
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,320
and Du family will be ruined.

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,120
Boss.

35
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,640
Don't let them in.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,320
Luo Tian, I leave the rest to you.

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,400
You know what to do, right?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,600
Don't worry.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
Who told you to let her in?

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,200
Didn't you hear what I said?

41
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,160
Miss Du,

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,560
the one who just entered is
Dihao Corporation's president, Mr. Mo.

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,320
He isn't someone we can offend.

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,060
I don't care if he is from Yinghao
or Dihao Corporation.

45
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,600
My words are the rules here.

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,160
Miss Du.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,160
Out of my way.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,080
Stop there.

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,880
Move!

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,400
Dad.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,040
Dad!

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,040
Disgraceful!

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,520
Have you learned nothing at all?

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,960
My sincere apologies, Mr. Luo.

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,840
I've been negligent.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,490
I will discipline my daughter
when we get home.

57
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,520
Please forgive her.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,320
It's you, Chairman Du.

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,600
Not anyone

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,960
can risk humiliating Dihao Corporation.

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,280
You!

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
Dad!

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480
I'm sorry, Dad.

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,320
Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!

65
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,840
Miaomiao.

66
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,680
Zhixing.

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,120
I knew you will come rescue me.

68
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,120
I already found out

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,200
that it was my mother
who hit your parents.

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,320
You saved me again this time.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,920
You are right in leaving me.

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
No.

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
I can't leave you anymore.

74
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,760
I can't do it.

75
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,600
Leng Zhixing, it's not going
to work out between us.

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,400
No, I can't do it.

77
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,160
Every time I hear you
come and go with Lin Yuhang,

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,840
I get so jealous I could go crazy.

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,080
What did you say?

80
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,720
Miaomiao,

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
I don't care whose daughter you are.

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,560
The past resentment is behind us now.

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,560
You are my woman.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,920
I won't let you go again.
