2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,930
- What did he say?
- To see you and Chairman Leng.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,780
Evacuate everyone at once.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Go, hurry.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,060
Leng Jiaxuan, what are you doing?

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,660
Uncle Chen, get the car now.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,200
Young Master, you cannot go.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,360
Leng Jiaxuan's target is me.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,980
I cannot make everyone else pay for it.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:41,680
Go.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,080
Let go. Let me go.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,200
Catching you is just the same
as catching Leng Zhixing.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,560
Get in.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,920
Jiaxuan.

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,360
Don't come here.
There's a bomb in the car.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,880
Jiaxuan, calm down.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,840
- What will Grandpa do?
- Don't mention him!

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,500
This is all because he is biased.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,700
If it weren't for him,

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,380
I would've been the chairman
of Leng Corporation.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
You all forced me to do this.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,980
You all forced me!

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,040
Run.

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,180
We'll settle our score

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,400
just between us.

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
Don't harm the innocents.

27
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,580
Don't you like pretending to be a cripple?

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,040
Men, beat him up.

29
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,200
Cripple his legs.

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,200
No.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,840
Zhixing.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,800
No.

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,020
You...

34
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,660
Zhixing.

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,180
Miaomiao, I'm fine.

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,340
Leng Zhixing,

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,800
you made me lose everything.

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,840
The company.

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,180
My woman.

40
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,440
Look at me.

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,180
I look like a homeless dog now.

42
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,620
Since you won't let me have it easy,

43
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,240
then we'll both have it the hard way.

44
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,240
If I die,

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,480
we die together.

46
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,060
No.

47
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,980
You can't.

48
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,240
Zhixing.

49
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,700
(Who let you in?)

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,640
(Get out.)

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,200
(So, he is Leng Zhixing.)

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,580
(From now on, you're my wife.)

53
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,140
What are you doing?

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,440
What are you doing?

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,180
What are you planning?

56
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,840
Fine, Leng Zhixing.

57
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,360
Let's die together!

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,980
Madam.

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,040
It's almost noon, have something to eat.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,500
Where is Zhixing?

61
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,580
Young Master Zhixing

62
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,280
might never come back.

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,340
Zhixing.

64
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,360
Zhixing.

65
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,740
I'm going to look for him.

66
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,080
Miaomiao,

67
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,320
you're pregnant, so don't move about.

68
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,360
What did you just say?

69
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,900
Check your own pulse.

70
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,620
Uncle Chen,

71
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,880
come to the hospital with me.

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
(Zhixing.)

73
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,940
(Our baby and I)

74
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,740
(will wait for your return.)

75
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:18,100
(One year later)

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,360
(Zhixing, you're finally back.)

77
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,740
(Grandpa, our child, and I are well.)

78
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,060
(Xia Jingxi pretended to be crazy
to avoid punishment)

79
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,260
(but she was exposed.)

80
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,220
(Zhixing, I'm so happy you're back.)

81
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,100
(Zhixing.)
