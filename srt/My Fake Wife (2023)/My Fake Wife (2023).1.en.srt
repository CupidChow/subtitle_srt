1
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,440
Leng Jiaxuan.

2
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,100
Why?

3
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,460
=My Fake Wife=
=Episode 1=

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,480
Miaomiao,

5
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,560
I'm letting you have this good marriage.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,180
You had better be grateful to me.

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,360
Xia Jingxi,

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,180
don't you love Leng Jiaxuan?

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,320
Why do you want me to marry him?

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,560
You're marrying the second son,

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,600
Leng Zhixing.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,620
Remember, you don't need to attend college
from tomorrow onwards.

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,420
Don't waste our years of effort
in raising an orphan like you.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,020
Oh, I forgot to mention.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,220
The second son
of the Leng family is a cripple.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,840
He cannot perform in bed.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,480
I believe he has a terrible temper too.

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,060
Miaomiao, I hope you will

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,020
take good care of him.

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,120
Dad, do you really want me to marry
the second son of the Leng family?

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,100
Miaomiao,

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,980
our Xia Corp is in trouble now.

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,580
We can only be saved

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,840
if you marry him.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,980
Oh, don't cry. Don't cry.

26
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,760
We won't marry.

27
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,660
We'll just let Xia Corp go bankrupt.

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,240
We'll explain to the Leng family now.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,560
Dad.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,380
We're not marrying. Come.

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,280
Dad.

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,620
I'll marry him.

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,620
Miaomiao,

34
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,480
you must never let Young Master Zhixing

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,240
find out that you are a substitute bride.

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,500
Otherwise, our Xia Corp will...

37
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,220
Come on, hurry up.

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,460
Oh? The cripple didn't come for the bride?

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,340
The Leng family doesn't want
to embarrass him after all.

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,180
From now onward,
you're called Xia Miaomiao.

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,820
This is your new home.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,440
(Daddy.)

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,200
(This is the last thing
I do for you.)

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,140
Young Master Zhixing is in the bedroom.

45
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,840
(Where is he?)

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,120
Ah!

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,520
(So he is)

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,000
(Leng Zhixing.)

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,960
(Leng Jiaxuan,
I'll make you lose everything,)

50
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,660
(including the woman you love.)

51
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,900
Xia Jingxi, who let you in? Get out.

52
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,780
Come over here.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,840
Do you want the entire Xia Corp
to go down with you?

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
Isn't it easy for you to serve men?

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,820
So?

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,180
(For Daddy,)

57
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,180
(I must endure and take care of him.)

58
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,020
Ah!

59
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,980
Are you that impatient?

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,540
Don't you know that by marrying me

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,780
you will live as a widow for life?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,900
No.

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,000
I just want to take care of you.

64
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,800
Oh?

65
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,220
Xia Jingxi,

66
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,100
doesn't Leng Jiaxuan love you very much?

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,200
Why else would I marry you?

68
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,900
From today onward,

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,780
you will sleep there.

70
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,000
(I cannot let him know
I'm a substitute bride.)

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,920
Why can that cripple steal my woman?

72
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,500
You're so unfair, Grandpa.

73
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,480
Jingxi, I regret it so much.

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,480
I regret I didn't kill him
in the accident back then.

75
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,320
I want all of you to pay!

76
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,020
Jiaxuan,

77
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,360
you'll have to wait so we can hide this

78
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,620
from your grandpa.

79
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
I'll come find you some time later.

80
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,420
Zhixing,

81
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,580
you've become like this

82
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,220
and you used Grandpa to steal my woman.

83
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
The scores we need to settle between us

84
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,640
are really piling up.

85
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,880
What's wrong?

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,780
Do you regret

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,900
not killing me six years ago?

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,760
Anyone can say that without evidence.

89
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,040
Don't be so pleased with yourself.

90
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,960
So what if you married Jingxi?

91
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,440
This woman has been with me
since she was 18.

92
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,760
All of her belongs to me.

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,060
You look at my woman

94
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,380
but you can do nothing else.

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,040
You must feel desperate, right?

96
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,460
Speaking of that,

97
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
I must really thank you, Jiaxuan,

98
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,480
for training her so well.

99
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,200
You see,

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,320
not only does she
take good care of my body,

101
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,220
