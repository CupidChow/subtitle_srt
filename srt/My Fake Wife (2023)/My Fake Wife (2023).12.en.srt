2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,120
Zhixing.

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,180
You're hurt.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,420
I'm fine.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,140
We need stop the bleeding and bandage it.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,640
You lost so much blood.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,640
Why were you so desperate?

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,020
Don't you know I'll get worried?

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,520
I'm fine.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,740
Don't worry about me.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,180
Luckily, I got back in time.

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,620
Miaomiao,

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,720
how did you know it was the ingredients?

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,460
I'm a member of Leng Corporation's
research team.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,460
Leng Medical's beauty products

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,700
mainly focused on health and being all-natural
which we've always endorsed.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,100
But the level of preservatives
in this product exceeded the limit

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,680
and could even be considered poisonous.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,140
I never expected Leng Jiaxuan
to go to such lengths for personal gains.

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,280
We cannot allow Leng Jiaxuan

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,040
to commit another crime.

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,960
We must hurry.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,840
How are you doing?

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,320
- Luo Tian?
- I'll take you to the hospital.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,700
Why are you here?

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,440
You were in danger,

27
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,580
President Mo sent me here.

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,420
Then, shall we go?

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,620
Okay.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,500
Thank you, doctor.

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,580
(Clinic 01)

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,600
Miaomiao,

33
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,920
wait for me.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,060
Okay.

35
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,040
Grandpa, I'm here to visit you.

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,760
I will protect the Leng Corp

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,380
in the next board of directors' reelection.

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,360
Gao Xiaolan?

39
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,980
You know my mother?

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,720
Director Wang?

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,360
No, no. I'm not.

42
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,040
Director Wang,

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,500
shall we find a spot to chat?

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,080
Miaomiao, he was the director of
the mental hospital where your mother was.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
I believe many things
will come to light soon.

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,120
Director Wang,

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,560
do you still remember
Gao Xiaolan's accident

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,040
six years ago?

49
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,640
I don't really remember.

50
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,880
Is that so?

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
A mentally ill person
escaped your supervision

52
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,980
and killed others by a car accident.

53
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,640
Are you sure you don't recall anything?

54
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,600
Then I'll help you remember.

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,880
Why did a large sum of money

56
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,620
get transferred into your bank account

57
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,620
from an offshore bank

58
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,020
right after the accident?

59
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,980
Do you remember now, Director Wang?

60
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,840
I remember now.

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,300
Fourteen years ago,

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,600
when Gao Xiaolan first
entered the mental hospital,

63
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,840
(Reception)
there was no mental abnormality.

64
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,880
Let me out.

65
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,840
I'm not sick. Let me out.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,700
After being locked up for a long time,

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,520
she started to become depressed

68
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,040
and hallucinate.

69
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,100
Oh, right.

70
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,420
There was one time,

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,260
she managed to escape.

72
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,740
Her body was bruised
when she got sent back.

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,600
Someone dumped her at the entrance.

74
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,340
It looked like she got beaten up.

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,140
The year I turned 18,

76
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,620
my mother visited me.

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,220
That must be it.

78
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,440
How did she get into the car accident?

79
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,820
On the day of the accident,

80
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,420
she didn't escape on her own.

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,460
A man came to pick her up.

82
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,780
After that day,

83
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,440
all the caregivers and doctors
who took care of her,

84
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,820
including myself,

85
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,600
were given a large sum of money

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,320
to leave Jianghai.

87
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,360
Who took her away?

88
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,020
Who gave you the money?

89
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,040
Who killed my mother?
