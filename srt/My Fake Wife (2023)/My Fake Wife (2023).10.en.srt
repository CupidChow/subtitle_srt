2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,480
That's enough.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,720
She is my older sister.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,160
I can't be too mean to her.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,520
Miaomiao,

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,760
you're really my good girl.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,760
You really got HE.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,640
You've done a great service

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,440
for Xia Corp.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,920
The truth is,

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,200
I've always looked forward to
you joining Xia Corp.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,560
Really?

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,640
Why haven't you mentioned it before?

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,600
I wanted to respect your decision.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,000
Weren't you studying
traditional Chinese medicine?

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,480
(If I hadn't known about
your hypocrisy and pretentiousness,)

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,000
(I would've almost believed you.)

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,600
Right, Miaomiao.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,140
In two days,

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,520
I plan to host a charity dinner of Xia Corp.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,800
On that day,

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,720
you'll bring Zhixing

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,680
to attend together.

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,840
As for President Mo,

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,640
I'll need you

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,960
to help us

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,800
extend an invitation to him.

28
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,240
Okay.

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,040
I don't care.

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,440
You have to take back HE.

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,320
That's my favorite brand.

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,920
Aren't you the president of Leng Corp?

33
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,800
Stop it.

34
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,840
That old man isn't dead yet.

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,480
Only by becoming the chairman

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,240
can we really hold all authority.

37
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,280
If you want HE,

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,120
we'll need a large sum of money.

39
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,520
We will need to work together on this.

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,080
Your father has a very special fund.

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,600
Go find out about it.

42
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,400
If we can get even a small portion of it,

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,480
we can get back HE tomorrow.

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,040
Special fund?

45
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,320
I think I know.

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
My Jingxi is simply amazing.

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,120
Zhixing.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,960
They fell for it.

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,960
There is a sum here
that gets remitted annually

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
into Liu Xiaoshan's private bank account.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,280
The amount isn't small

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,240
and it began six years ago.

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,440
Luo Tian,

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,960
check this account.

55
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,680
After so long,

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
we finally got some clues.

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,800
Good work, honey.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,080
Boss, I found Liu Xiaoshan.

59
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,720
Miaomiao,

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm going on a business trip today.

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Will you be okay on your own?

62
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,360
Then you had better come home early.

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,760
What?

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,900
Check it.

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,800
Who investigated Liu Xiaoshan?

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,400
If needs be,

67
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
kill them.

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,360
Xia Zhengnan,

69
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,560
you're heartless.

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
Don't blame me for this payback.

71
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,840
Wait here, I'll go after him.

72
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
He got away.
