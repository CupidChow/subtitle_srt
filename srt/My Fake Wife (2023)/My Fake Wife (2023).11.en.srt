2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,810
President Xia, terrible news.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,610
Severe allergy reactions have occurred at

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,180
numerous beauty salons under the company.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,980
Some clients even got disfigured.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,140
Please take a look.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,420
Right now, a lot of clients

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,220
are reporting us
for using inferior products.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,180
Find out what the problem is.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,540
Do everything

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,770
to appease

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,860
and compensate.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,340
Go.

14
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,580
Yes, I'll go right away.

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,220
Wait.

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,570
I'll come with you.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,890
Xia Miaomiao,

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,860
you had this coming.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,350
Contact all major news media.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,780
The headlines I want to see tomorrow is

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,340
"Calls to remove Xia Miaomiao
from the position of CEO

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,540
due to lack of ability
resulting in mismanagement and disfigurement."

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,940
(The number you dialed
is currently unanswered...)

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,240
(Please try again later.)

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,550
(In Jianghai City, the incompetence
of the new president)

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,700
(of Xia Corporation Xia Miaomiao)

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,410
(has led to serious mismanagement)

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,350
(and the use of inferior products
resulted in dire consequences.)

29
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,970
(How will Xia Corporation
handle this incident?)

30
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,510
(Stay tuned for updates.)

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,510
Hello?

32
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,910
Luo Tian, we're going back
to Jianghai immediately.

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,650
Boss, I just fell asleep.

34
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,350
Can't this wait until tomorrow?

35
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,050
It's an emergency. Come over now.

36
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,620
What's up, boss?

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,950
Did something happen to Miss Xia?

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,030
We're leaving now.

39
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,190
Boss, look at the weather outside.

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,540
The typhoon is blowing.

41
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,890
How? All flights are canceled.

42
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,920
We'll drive back.

43
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:09,970
But...

44
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,830
I'll drive back.

45
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,130
Fine.

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,180
You can't drive.

47
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,010
I'll drive.

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,370
Bring me the list of ingredients.

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,770
I finally found the cause.

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,700
Calm down, put down the knife.

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,930
- Get your boss here.
- Put down the knife.

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,770
Calm down and put down the knife.

53
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,400
(Where is the security?
How did he get inside?)

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,070
Hurry.

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,090
Sir.

56
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,980
Are you the boss?

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,310
I am.

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,580
My daughter spent so much money

59
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,500
on your beauty treatments.

60
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,030
Not only you didn't make her beautiful,

61
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,930
you even disfigured her
with inferior products.

62
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,940
She is only 20 years old.

63
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,040
How can she get married later?

64
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,390
You unscrupulous merchants!

65
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,870
I want you all to pay!

66
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,890
A perfectly fine girl

67
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,060
turned ugly because of her.

68
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
I must say,

69
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,660
people like her

70
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,420
deserve to die.

71
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,070
Sir,

72
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,620
calm down.

73
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,170
I found out the truth about this matter.

74
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,660
The problem occurred because

75
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,490
our products got switched
with inferior counterfeits.

76
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
The one who switched them

77
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,750
is Leng Corporation.

78
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,820
This young lady

79
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,500
is the wife of
the Leng Corporation's president.

80
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,770
She used you.

81
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,990
It's true.

82
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,190
Think about it.

83
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,110
Didn't she instigate you

84
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,330
to make trouble here

85
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,160
by saying our products have problems?

86
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,430
It was you! It was you!

87
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,950
No, no, no.

88
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,670
It wasn't me.

89
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,370
Don't believe her.

90
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,210
Did she also tell you

91
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,460
that she is the wife
of Leng Corporation's president

92
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,530
and that Leng Medical has a way
to cure your daughter?

93
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,370
I am the wife of
Leng Corporation's president.

94
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,070
Leng Corp has the best
medical equipment in the world.

95
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,620
Your daughter can be cured.

96
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,090
Are you really the wife of
Leng Corporation's president?

97
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,610
Of course.

98
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,810
Don't worry and go.

99
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,910
I will have the security
transferred away then.

100
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm not the wife of the president.

101
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,460
She is!

102
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,100
Leng Zhixing comes
to pick her up every day.

103
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,460
I don't care who you are.

104
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,940
If no one takes responsibility,
then all of you will die!

105
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,130
I am Leng Zhixing.

106
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,460
I will take responsibility.
