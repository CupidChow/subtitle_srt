2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,840
Save Xia Corp

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,600
and save Jingxi.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,120
She is going mad

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,120
for Leng Zhixing.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,120
I was wrong.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,960
We spoiled her too much
since she was a child.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,040
That's the reason

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,240
she acts so willfully.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,000
If you want to blame,

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,840
then blame me.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,680
Up until now,

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,560
all you think about
is Jingxi and Xia Corp.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,240
What about me?

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,520
I know

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,040
you're capable and independent.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,440
Leng Zhixing,

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
he loves you

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,720
more than he loves himself.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
There is nothing I worry

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,480
except for Jingxi.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,880
All the money

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,300
from Xia Foundation

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,640
are inside the safe all these years.

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,760
This is one of the keys.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,240
I had someone sent it here.

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,720
If I don't give it to you,
I might not have another chance to.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,280
Keep this.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,760
The other key

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,800
is with Leng Jiaxuan.

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,520
You must get it back.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,800
Take these money

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,240
and help those

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,720
who are really in need.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,920
I promise.

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,040
Jingxi.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,720
You're here.

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,720
Dad.

39
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,360
You girls

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,840
must take care.

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,760
Okay.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,600
Apologize to Zhixing

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,000
in my stead.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,520
Can you call me "Dad" again?

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,920
Dad.

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,280
Dad.

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,840
Dad.

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,160
Dad.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,440
Boss,

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,560
Xia Jingxi wants to meet Mo Sinian.

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
She is finally here.

52
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
President Mo,

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
let's get straight to the point.

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,440
I know you like Xia Miaomiao.

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
I can help you

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,000
get her.

57
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,200
Why?

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,920
That's because I want Leng Zhixing.

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
Don't you think

60
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm richer than Leng Zhixing?

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,160
It's a pity what happened to your face.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,320
Do you know that
Leng Zhixing's legs aren't lame?

63
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,840
Only I am worthy to be his wife.

64
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,920
Aren't you rather confident, Miss Xia?

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Speak.

66
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,920
How do you want to cooperate?

67
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,880
Come to this place tomorrow.

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,840
I will send her

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
straight to your bed.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,480
Pleasure to work with you.

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,680
Miaomiao,

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,240
you're working so late into the night.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,280
I promised Dad to save Xia Corp.

74
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,280
Dad is gone.

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,800
Xia Corp is in your hands now.

76
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,200
I stewed this chicken soup.

77
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,360
Try it.

78
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,640
Oh.

79
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,520
It smells good.

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,480
Drink more.

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:07,960
Okay.

82
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
It tastes good.

83
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,200
It's late and you're tired.

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll be leaving first.

85
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,320
Don't forget to rest.

86
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,560
