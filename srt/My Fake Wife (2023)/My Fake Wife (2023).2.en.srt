00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,420
(Medical Textbook)

3
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,720
Young Master, you're back.

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,840
Drop the pretentious act.

5
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,080
I didn't expect my wife

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,720
is someone with
much emotional experience.

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,940
Since eighteen years old.

8
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,820
Young Master, I didn't.

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,390
Don't call for me.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,380
Get out.

11
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,720
(He is a weirdo to begin with.)

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,560
(Why should I cry?)

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,360
(Where can I go now?)

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,740
Stop, don't run.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,360
Where is he?

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,480
Let's split up, go.

17
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,620
Thank you.

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,040
My apologies. If you're hurt,

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,180
you may claim compensation from me.

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,900
(He is the famous and mysterious Mo Sinian.)

21
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,680
(Why do I have a feeling)

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,060
(he resembles Leng Zhixing?)

23
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,220
(Except for his legs.)

24
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,280
Uncle Chen, go pick up the madam.

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,020
Boss, you're finally back.

26
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,180
Why didn't you bring me along
to investigate Leng Jiaxuan?

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,060
Here is Dihao Corporation's
financial report.

28
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,460
Thank you for managing Dihao Corporation
in my stead for the past six years.

29
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,280
Oh, right.

30
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,340
Boss, your wife

31
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,060
is having fun with Leng Jiaxuan
at a bar right now.

32
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,820
What did you say?

33
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,940
It's true. Watch my videos
if you don't believe me.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
Once that cripple finds out

35
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,420
he married a fake,

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,100
would he die from anger?

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm your woman.

38
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,700
How could I marry that cripple?

39
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,940
My Jingxi is so smart,

40
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,300
you even fooled me.

41
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,300
Leng Zhixing,

42
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,740
serves you right.

43
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,700
Go and check

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,740
who is the woman I married.

45
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,460
You're smiling? You actually smiled!

46
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,980
Hurry up.

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,300
Okay.

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,620
Madam, this way.

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,600
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

50
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,700
Hello, Boss.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,320
I found it.

52
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,080
She is the adopted daughter
of the Xia family, Xia Miaomiao.

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,380
I've sent you the information.

54
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,660
Take a look.

55
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,180
Okay, got it.

56
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,180
Sophomore at Jiangcheng College of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xia Miaomiao.

57
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,660
You'll sleep over there tonight.

58
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,940
It's getting late.

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,060
Go to bed.

60
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,680
(Why is he suddenly so kind?)

61
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,860
Dad...

62
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,220
Mom...

63
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,300
