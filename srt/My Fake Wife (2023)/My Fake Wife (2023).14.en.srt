2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,220
Grandpa,

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,680
you're awake.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,720
Zhixing, I'm fine for now.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,880
I just can't move.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,160
I have no way

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,680
to go over there and support you.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,800
We cannot alert our enemies.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,320
Okay.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,080
Go forth confidently.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,600
Don't hold anything back.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,120
Okay.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,560
Jiaxuan,

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,760
just accept it.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,080
Director Wang, how is it?

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,120
Have you recalled

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,160
who picked up Gao Xiaolan that day?

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,320
The man

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
who fights Young Master Zhixing
for the chairman position

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,320
is the one who gave me money.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,120
Come, Director Wang.
I'll take you through the backdoor.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,680
Okay.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,040
Miaomiao, thank you very much.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,720
It's thanks to your daily
acupuncture and physiotherapy

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,600
that my weary old body

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
recovered so quickly.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,760
It's what I should do.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,480
Zhixing, you found a wonderful wife.

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,080
Now, I wish for nothing more than

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,760
to see a great-grandchild from you two.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
Then, I'll be perfectly content.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
Grandpa.

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,300
Jiaxuan, how did it go?

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,360
It's over.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,800
It's all over.

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,200
Chairman Leng, you're awake.

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,040
That's him.

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,300
It's all thanks to Miaomiao.

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,920
You've raised a good daughter.

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,640
Miaomiao is still young.

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,160
Please take care of her, Zhixing.

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Miaomiao is my wife.

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
Of course, I'll look after her.

44
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,600
He was the one who picked up Gao Xiaolan.

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,320
You rascal.

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,920
Go surrender yourself.

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,400
(Jingxi,)

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,900
(if it weren't for
your grandfather's position,)

49
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,480
(did you think your father will marry me)

50
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,480
(and treat us well?)

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,620
(Chairman Leng.)

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Hello, boss.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,440
It's just as you expected.

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,600
Miaomiao, the result is the same as
when I investigated as Mo Sinian.

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,840
Leng Jiaxuan and your father

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,280
planned the accident six years ago.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Zhixing,

58
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,560
I know you are Mo Sinian.

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,240
I only have you now.

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,280
How are you doing?

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
Why are you here?

62
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,040
Miaomiao.
I'll protect you from now on.

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,680
Okay.

64
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,840
Dad, I don't care.

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,800
I want to switch places with Xia Miaomiao.

66
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,120
Why should she take my place?

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,760
I'm the one Leng Zhixing wanted to marry.

68
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,900
The marriage certificate
has my name on it.

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,160
Zhengnan.

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,880
Jingxi is the real wife
of the Leng Corp's chairman.

71
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
Why don't you talk to Leng Zhixing

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,200
and have Xia Miaomiao returned?

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,120
You two wanted Xia Miaomiao
to become the substitute bride then.

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Didn't you have a hand in it?

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,160
Didn't you also think Leng Jiaxuan

76
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,800
can become the real chairman of Leng Corp?

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,600
How would I know he is useless?

78
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,680
Mom, you always taught me

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,160
to get a high status

80
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
just like Grandfather did,

81
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,360
so we can live a good life.

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,760
You said so.

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,200
You have to help me.

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm the real wife
of Leng Corp's chairman.

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,720
I know.

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
I will make you the wife
of Leng Corp's chairman.

87
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,400
Okay?

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,320
Go take a rest.

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
I'll persuade your father.

90
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
(I will become
the true owner of Leng Corp.)

91
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,760
Come with me.

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
What are you doing?

93
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
You said you love me.

94
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,200
I have plenty of money overseas.
Come, we'll get married.

95
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,800
Let go.

96
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,240
You got kicked out of Leng Corp.
Why should I marry you?

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Zhixing,

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
I drank too much.

100
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,040
Come here.

101
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,920
He just became the chairman

102
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
and you're already
throwing yourself at him?

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,750
I want to be the wife
of Leng Corp's chairman.

104
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,480
Can you do that?

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:45,960
You...

106
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Zhixing.

107
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,480
Someone is following us.

108
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,760
Let her.

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,280
Xia Miaomiao.

110
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,160
You don't deserve this.

111
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,210
I picked some vegetables
from the garden today.

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
You can try it later.

113
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,160
You're getting more capable, honey.

114
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,200

must be me!
