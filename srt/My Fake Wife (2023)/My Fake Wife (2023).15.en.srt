2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,320
(Xia Jingxi)
(Heartbroken.)

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,720
(Got to accept this betrayal.)

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,360
(When disappointment reaches this stage,)

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,160
(I can no longer feel the pain.)

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,840
(What do you think they see in her?)

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,840
(That Leng Zhixing must be blind.)

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,040
(Jingxi is so wonderful.)

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,880
(I pity Jingxi)

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,320
(for having a sister like this.)

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,560
(She isn't just two-timing him.)

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,600
(Help our pitiful Jingxi.)

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,840
So, that's how she climbed to the top.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,520
I can't even tell.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,000
(Xia Jingxi.)

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,800
Are you crazy?

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,680
Watch carefully.

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,720
That was my doing.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,120
Xia Jingxi,

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,560
I was going to leave you some dignity

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,680
but it looks like you don't want it.

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,440
(Growing old, hand-in-hand @XiaMiaomiao)
Leng Corp's chairman openly declared his love.

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
My God!

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,040
He is so handsome.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,360
Aren't his legs lame?

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
Has he recovered?

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,160
So, Xia Jingxi was
the one stirring up trouble.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,360
President Xia, you're incredible.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,680
We really admire you.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,720
Go back to work.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
I let you manage the PR department

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,000
and you misused it like this.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
Shameful!

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,880
Get out of Xia Corp now.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,640
Shameful?

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,720
Your reputation is all you care about.

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,320
I am your daughter.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,280
Xia Miaomiao is just adopted.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Get out!

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,680
Hello?

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,620
Is it Xia Zhengnan?

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,620
Isn't it time

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,520
to settle the score between us?

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,720
What do you want?

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,120
Your key

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
and Xia Jingxi.

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,520
Send her and the key to me

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,480
and I'll shut up.

49
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,520
Otherwise,

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,720
the evidence I have

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,360
will reach Leng Zhixing

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,720
and Xia Miaomiao soon.

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,520
Leng Jiaxuan,

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,240
don't force my hand.

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,920
Stop your nonsense.

56
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,080
I'll countdown from three.

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,920
Three.

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:06,840
Two.

59
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,360
Where do we meet?

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,360
I'll send you the location.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
Okay.

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,120
The boss said to clean everything up.

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,200
Hide all these.

64
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,560
Once you see him, get rid of him.

65
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,320
How dare you, Xia Zhengnan.

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,800
You sent someone to kill me.

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,280
You're heartless.

68
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't blame me for this payback.

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,880
Xia Miaomiao, I will take back
everything that is mine.

70
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,360
Are you having a hard time without me?

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,760
Let me go.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,240
After years of relationship,

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
you have no choice

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,880
but to join hands with me.

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,320
The position of Leng Corp
chairman's wife aside,

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,280
you won't even get a share

77
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
in Xia Corp.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
What do you mean?

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,360
That's because I know a secret

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,320
that no one knows.

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,760
Impossible.

82
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,840
