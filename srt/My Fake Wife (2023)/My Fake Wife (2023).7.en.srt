00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,020
=My Fake Wife=
=Episode 7=

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,760
I want to work in Xia Corp.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,020
What do you think?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,580
No.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,080
What good are you

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,660
to Xia Corp as a fresh graduate?

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,160
This isn't a joke.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,960
Miaomiao can start from the very bottom.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,900
(I will work you to the bone.)

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,060
When I married into the Leng family,

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,220
the Leng family
acquired 15% of Xia Corp's shares

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,140
to rescue it from a financial crisis.

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,920
Now I want to be the CEO of Xia Corp.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,700
What do you think?

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,800
Impossible!

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,960
Why should an adopted daughter
get to manage Xia Corp?

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,060
Dad, the CEO

18
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,160
can only be me.

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,260
Zhengnan,

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,260
Jingxi is the future wife
of the real Leng Corp's chairman.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,320
Be quiet.

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,900
Xia Miaomiao,

23
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,720
you're just a novice graduate.

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,660
How capable can you be?

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
It's not up to you to decide
whether I'm capable or not.

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,520
Alright, stop fighting.

27
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,100
Regarding the latest luxury brand HE,

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,200
our Xia Corp

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,260
must secure this brand collaboration.

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,340
You are both dear to me.

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,540
Why don't we let actions
speak for themselves?

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,460
Okay.

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,680
Don't overestimate yourself.

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,120
HE is Leng Corp's ally

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,880
and Leng Zhixing is about to divorce you.

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,720
What is this?

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,620
Distributor for HE in Asia-Pacific.

38
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,260
This is your breakup fee.

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,260
Take back your money.

40
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,060
I don't want it.

41
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,020
(Distributor for HE in Asia-Pacific.)

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,060
Have you heard?

43
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,040
Leng Zhixing from Leng Medical Foundation
is coming to the alumni meeting.

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,640
Is he awarding students
who join the project team?

45
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,480
(Zhixing,)

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,920
(I know I'm being shameless
for accepting the breakup fee,)

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,820
(but for old time's sake,)

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,320
(please help me one more time.)

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
Yuhang. Yuhang!

50
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,260
I sent you so many messages.

51
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,380
Why haven't you replied?

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,460
Hey.

53
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you still like Xia Miaomiao?

54
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,220
This is none of your business.

55
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,020
Du Siyu,

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,660
I hope you will not waste your time on me.

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,420
I...

58
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,340
Xia Miaomiao,

59
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,140
you left school for so long

60
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,200
and you joined

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,160
Leng Medical research project team
as soon as you return.

62
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,500
Your seduction skills worked well indeed.

63
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,820
Yuhang,

64
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm going to the restroom.

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,380
Hey.

66
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,920
Miaomiao doesn't need to rely on a man
to join the project team.

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,160
Please don't start any rumors.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,740
Yuhang.

69
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,820
Xia Miaomiao,

70
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,540
it's all your fault!

71
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,900
I'm warning you, Xia Miaomiao.

72
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,460
Stay away from Yuhang.

73
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,300
You married a man
who doesn't belong to you

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,620
and you still want to seduce Yuhang.

75
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,860
What gives you the right?

76
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,480
- You!
- I don't know what right I have,

77
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,160
but I know one thing very clearly.

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,040
Whether I'm married or not,

79
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,660
Lin Yuhang will never love you.

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,780
And

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880
I'm warning you too.

82
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,040
Stop calling him a man
who doesn't belong to me

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
or you will get what's coming.

84
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,000
Stop there!

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
Xia Miaomiao, you...

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,880
You shamelessly got together

87
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,100
with a man who doesn't belong to you

88
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,200
and you still want to climb higher?

89
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,060
Lin Yuhang

90
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,080
is still a relative of the Leng family.

91
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,800
If Yuhang's mother knows you're married

92
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
and still fool around with her son,

93
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,380
do you think she will let you off?

94
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
We'll just have to wait and see.

95
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,060
Xia Miaomiao, you...

96
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
Boss.

97
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,540
Miss Xia and Lin Yuhang

98
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,020
joined the alumni meeting today.

99
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,180
However, the chosen location

100
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,700
is the Du family's holiday resort.

101
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,220
Du Siyu

102
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,780
is the daughter of the Du family.

103
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,860
Siyu,

104
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,460
I can see why you say

105
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,660
only Yuhang can be your perfect match.

106
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,600
Yeah. I wonder what tactic Xia Miaomiao used

107
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,240
to hold onto Yuhang.

108
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,340
It makes me so mad.

109
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,360
From now on,

110
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,160
we're like sisters and best friends.

111
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,940
Cheers.
