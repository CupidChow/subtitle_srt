2
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,000
What is this?

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,800
I knew you came to me
to get the HE contract.

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,440
How did you know?

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,840
I know Leng Jiaxuan and Xia Jingxi
are also looking for the person in charge of HE.

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,360
Zhixing,

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
your legs are clearly fine.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Why pretend to be lame?

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,600
I'm sorry, Miaomiao.

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,080
I'm doing this to blind Leng Jiaxuan.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,520
I know.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,360
That's why I want to join Xia Corp
and become the CEO

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,800
to find out the truth

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,400
and expose his hypocritical side.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,640
I'll help you with
anything you want to do.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,880
Thank you, Zhixing.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,960
Hello, President Leng and President Xia.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,720
Our president said she will be late.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,040
Please wait right here for a moment.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,920
Looks like you really put in the effort

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,240
to win HE over.

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,600
With this set of quality HE knockoffs on you,

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
you actually look quite the part.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,440
Knockoffs?

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,520
I'm afraid you need to have your eyes checked.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,400
I am the CEO of Xia Fashion Corporation.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,240
Why wouldn't I know about HE?

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,680
I know all their designs
like the back of my hand.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,680
Your piece

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,320
is a global limited edition
designer piece.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,080
They say the chief designer for HE, Wei De,

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,440
did not plan on mass-producing it

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,880
and only made one piece by hand.

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,920
Don't tell me,

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,440
Wei De gave it you as a gift.

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,280
That's right.

37
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,720
Wei De gave it to me.

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,920
For Miaomiao,

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,080
a piece of clothes is nothing.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Jingxi,

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,960
why are you angry at Zhixing?

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
He is just a cripple.

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,920
He can only use methods like this
to please women.

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,480
When we get HE,

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,280
you can have as many as you want.

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,840
You're right.

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
Let's get ready at the conference room.

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,520
Let's go.

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,400
Hello, everyone.

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
I am the global chief designer
for HE, Wei De.

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,680
I am pleased
to welcome everyone here today

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,840
to the HE Asia Pacific
brand collaboration proposal meeting.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,480
As everyone knows,

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,440
Leng Corporation has
a very close relationship with HE.

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,280
Since Grandpa left
Leng Corporation to me,

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,920
HE will surely do my grandpa this favor.

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,960
Why would you look for trouble?

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,840
I am also especially honored
to be here today

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
as a representative of HE Corporation

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,920
to witness the inauguration of
the president for the Asia Pacific region.

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,880
- I didn't hear about this inauguration.
- Who is it?

62
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,140
Looks like the new president is going
to announce the collaboration.

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,160
Next,

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,560
let us welcome the president
for the HE Asia Pacific,

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
Miss Xia Miaomiao.

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,440
Impossible.

67
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,480
You're not qualified!

68
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,520
Everyone,

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,560
this is my appointment letter.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,240
You may all take a look.

71
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
You are Xia Jingxi
from Xia Corporation, right?

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,880
If you're not here with a proposal,

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,080
you may leave now.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,480
If you're here for a cooperation,

75
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,800
please sit down.

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,120
This is HE,

77
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
not Xia Corp.

78
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Leng Zhixing,

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
just you wait.

80
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,300
(President's Office)

81
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,640
Throw out her things.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
Go.

83
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,920
What are you doing?

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
Who told you to touch my things?

85
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,680
And you.

86
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
Get out!

87
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,920
Drag her out.

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,800
Jingxi,

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
don't you know to accept your loss?

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,600
Not accepting it?

91
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,520
Go find Daddy.

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,080
Fine, just you wait.

93
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,160
Dad.

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
Why is Xia Miaomiao taking my position?

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,840
If I hear another word from you,
get out of Xia Corp.
