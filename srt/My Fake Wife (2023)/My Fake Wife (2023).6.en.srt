=My Fake Wife=
=Episode 6=

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,820
Did you say Leng Zhixing's parents

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,780
were killed by a mental patient
in an accident?

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,720
Yeah.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,340
By a crazy woman from
Jiangcheng Mental Hospital.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,060
Drop her off. Stop the car.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,300
(I have to ask Dad.)

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,480
Yuhang,

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,580
I need to go.

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,360
Miaomiao.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,920
You made a fortune on that land.

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,620
Are you keeping it all?

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,640
If I don't have Miaomiao,

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,940
Leng Zhixing wouldn't have slipped.

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,300
Mo Sinian wouldn't breach
the contract so willingly.

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,620
Let me go.
Miaomiao, hurry and save me.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,760
(Take this USB flash drive.)

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,480
(You know what to do, right?)

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,750
What are you doing?

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm using your laptop

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,320
to look for documents.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,600
Sounds like your daughter
is very valuable.

23
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,120
But

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,540
you don't lack money, do you?

25
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,440
After so many years,

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,480
you haven't given me a cent
from all the money you pocketed

27
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,080
from Xia Charitable Foundation.

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,940
Don't speak nonsense.

29
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,260
You also can't wash your hands off
Gao Xiaolan's accident six years ago.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,480
Your misdeeds at the Charitable Foundation

31
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,780
are all clear as day on my side.

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,020
Should I...

33
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,880
What do you want?

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,540
Use your money to
help me secure the position

35
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,880
as the chairman of Leng Corporation.

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,780
When that time comes,

37
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,240
you will become my father-in-law.

38
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,620
As the saying goes,

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,860
every miller draws water
to his own mill, right?

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,920
(No, this can't be true.)

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,660
(Daddy,)

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,940
(so it was you and Leng Jiaxuan)

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,060
(who planned my mother's death.)

44
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,740
(From the beginning to the end,)

45
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,400
(you were just using me.)

46
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,040
(Zhixing,)

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,940
(you broke up with me)

48
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,660
(because my mother
caused the death of your parents.)

49
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,760
(I'm so sorry.)

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,920
(I know it's over between us,)

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,280
(but I will find)

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,820
(the truth from six years ago for you)

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,380
(and make them pay for it.)

54
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,240
Mo Sinian,

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,380
can we meet again?

56
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,160
Miaomiao?

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,260
Mr. Mo,

58
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,340
I would like your help.

59
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,720
You know

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,020
that I can never refuse you.

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,100
I want to be the CEO
in Xia Corporation.

62
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,760
I can help you take down
the entire Xia Corporation.

63
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,520
How is that?

64
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,880
Alright.

65
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,180
Deal.

66
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,680
A pleasure to work with you.

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,380
Miaomiao is back. Come here.

68
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,580
Sit.

69
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,240
Dad.

70
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,200
You're just in time for dinner.

71
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,360
She is now

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,500
Mo Sinian's favorite person.

73
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,640
How can she stomach
the food at our Xia household?

74
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,120
Miaomiao, heed my advice.

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,600
Even though your husband

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
is unable to perform marital duties,

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Leng family is nonetheless a famed family.

78
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,140
Right now, with the way

79
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,560
you are associated with Mo Sinian,

80
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,980
assuming you don't care about Xia family,

81
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,300
you should consider
Leng family's reputation.

82
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,280
Leng Zhixing is going to divorce her soon.

83
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,140
Don't you know yet?

84
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,340
Is that true, Miaomiao?

85
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,940
Do you wish it to be true

86
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,160
or false?

87
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,620
I do hope you and Zhixing

88
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,740
can grow old together

89
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,540
and stay blissfully married.

90
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,760
Miaomiao is so pitiful.

91
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,260
You married a cripple

92
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,280
and then a disfigured Mo Sinian showed up.

93
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,060
I feel sorry for you.

94
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,160
So what if he has money?

95
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,780
Uh...

96
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,440
Your mother has prepared the dishes.

97
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,380
Let's have dinner.

98
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,160
In fact, if Miaomiao

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,000
and Mo Sinian

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,860
can foster a good working relationship,

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
it'll benefit Xia family too.

102
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,300
Okay. Come, let's eat.

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,440
This dish tastes good.

104
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,900
Miaomiao, have this.

105
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,840
Eat more. You too.

106
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,300
Right, Dad.

107
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,640
That year,

108
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,860
how did my mother get into an accident?

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,540
I don't know.

110
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,340
She...

111
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,580
After she got out of

112
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,380
the mental hospital that year,

113
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,660
she drove

114
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
and hit someone.

115
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Did you visit her when you adopted me
into the Xia family?

116
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,020
I didn't.

117
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,300
But every year, I sent people

118
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,240
to the mental hospital

119
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,920
to pay her fees.

120
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,140
I even arranged for specialists
to look after her.

121
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,560
Did you visit her after that?

122
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,160
No.

123
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,920
Miaomiao,
are you feeling alright?

124
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,120
It's nothing.

125
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,560
I paid my respect to her

126
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,900
when I went back to Gao Village.

127
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,080
It just suddenly occurred to me.

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,780
I'm about to graduate.

129
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,300
I want to work in Xia Corp.

130
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,100
