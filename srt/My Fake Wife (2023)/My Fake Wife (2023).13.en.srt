2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,920
There were three persons.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,360
Don't be upset, Miaomiao.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,800
Zhixing,

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,720
thank you for your heroic act

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,820
that pacified the matter at Leng Medical.

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,140
To repay you,

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,500
you can stay at home

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,660
from tomorrow onward

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,260
to recuperate your injured legs.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,540
Don't worry.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,980
Apart from your minuscule
dividend payouts,

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,480
I will give you pocket money

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,060
as your brother.

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,640
I'm loyal, right?

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,380
Oh, yes.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,700
I can also

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,040
provide for Miaomiao.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,060
I'll offer you an advice.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,660
Don't get too overconfident.

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,080
Miaomiao, let's go.

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,800
You don't deserve
to take part in Leng Corp's

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,160
shareholders' general meeting.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,100
Wait until you married Jiaxuan

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,600
before you get involved with Leng Corp.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Miaomiao, let's go.

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,200
Jiaxuan,

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
can we get married after tomorrow?

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,040
We'll see how you perform.

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,240
After the incident where my brother
used inferior ingredients in production,

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,320
the price of Leng Corporation's
shares has plummeted.

32
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,000
Luckily, I was there

33
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,600
to solve this matter.

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,740
Oh?

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,680
Zhixing,

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,500
if only you weren't blinded by greed,

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,440
then Leng Corp wouldn't have
suffered such a huge loss.

38
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,440
If I hadn't blocked the media in time

39
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,980
and personally pacified the victim,

40
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,320
I'm afraid

41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,960
you might already be in jail.

42
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,160
Young Master Jiaxuan
is indeed more reliable.

43
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,400
Everyone may watch this video

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,540
and see who saved the day.

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,660
I don't care who you are.

46
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,960
If no one takes responsibility,
then all of you will die!

47
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,420
I am Leng Zhixing.
I will take responsibility.

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,780
Who should be the one in jail?

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,200
Leng Medical has always been
managed under your name.

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,300
So,

51
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,860
you must have authorized the switch.

52
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,620
Do you dare

53
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,540
confront your scapegoat in jail?

54
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,200
This is no longer important.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,380
Everyone, don't forget

56
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,500
who brought you profits

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,580
through that land deal at Gao Village?

58
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,200
Yes.

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,920
Let's thank President Leng.

60
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,040
This time,

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,700
we need a leader

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,200
who can truly lead Leng Corp

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,160
toward success.

64
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,380
Next, we will vote between
Young Master Zhixing

65
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,800
and Young Master Jiaxuan.

66
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,660
(Leng Corporation's Chairman Election)
(Leng Jiaxuan  Leng Zhixing)

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,160
The result is evident.

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,660
Leng Jiaxuan, 19 votes.

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,780
Leng Zhixing, 3 votes.

70
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,180
Congratulations, Leng Jiaxuan,

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,600
on your election as
Leng Corporation's Chairman.

72
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,220
Wait. Grandpa is the company's
biggest shareholder.

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,600
He hasn't voted.

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,680
Although Grandpa cannot
exercise his shareholder rights,

75
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,000
I have the authority to his voting rights

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,600
as the president

77
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,200
that he personally appointed.

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,680
This vote will go to...

79
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,520
You rascal.

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,020
I'll talk to you back home.

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
Grandpa?

82
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,520
I hereby announce

83
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,860
Leng Jiaxuan is relieved of his post
as Leng Corp's CEO.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,260
From now on,

85
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,680
he is not allowed to be involved
in any businesses under Leng Corp.

86
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,220
My successor is Leng Zhixing.

87
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,400
He will be the chairman

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,560
and the president.

89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,260
Grandpa.

90
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,940
I will protect Leng Corp for you.

91
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,420
I know you always want
us brothers to be in harmony,

92
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,720
but Jiaxuan has become cruel

93
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,580
in order to get Leng Corp.

94
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,540
He secretly switched ingredients
to harm others.

95
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,100
I suspect he is behind

96
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,100
your fall and my parents' death.

97
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,960
If I get concrete evidence,

98
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,120
I hope you can forgive me.
