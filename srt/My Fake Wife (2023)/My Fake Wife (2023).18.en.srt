2
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,880
Xia Miaomiao,

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,170
I've done my utmost for you.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,660
Go have fun with Mo Sinian tonight.

5
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,650
You're awake.

6
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,750
Why are you here?

7
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,620
Don't be nervous.

8
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,770
Don't come over here.

9
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,860
Didn't we have fun the last time?

10
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,690
Don't come over here.

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,690
Let me go.

12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,940
Don't come over here.

13
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,110
Let me go.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,750
(My dear sister,)

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,900
(enjoy your night.)

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,310
Xia Jingxi wants to see you.

17
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,510
I refuse.

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,020
Young Master Zhixing refuses to see you.

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,430
Give this to him.

20
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,940
He will see me.

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,420
I knew you will see me.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,290
A gentleman prefers death to humiliation.

23
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,340
How could the esteemed
president of Leng Corp

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,820
stand such outright humiliation?

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,650
Where are they?

26
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,860
Speak.

27
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,670
How about we cooperate?

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,390
Speak.

29
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,500
I can help you take revenge.

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,780
Leng Corp alone isn't enough

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,150
to fight Dihao Corporation.

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,420
Why should I trust you?

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,350
I have the key to my father's safe.

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,570
Inside are all the money

35
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,750
from the foundation over the years.

36
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,550
I can help you find Leng Jiaxuan

37
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,980
to get the other key back.

38
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,510
And

39
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,230
I can also get you

40
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,130
the evidence that they planned
your parents' death.

41
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,150
How's that?

42
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,830
What are your conditions?

43
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,180
I want to get married to you

44
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,860
and become the real wife
of Leng Corp's chairman.

45
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,590
Zhixing,

46
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,070
I love you.

47
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,500
If we can get the money
from the foundation,

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
we can go anywhere together.

49
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,450
Xia Miaomiao has betrayed you.

50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,870
Only I am worthy of you.

51
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,190
Fine.

52
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,590
I agree.

53
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,870
Then I shall

54
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,540
take care of you tonight.

55
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,710
Jingxi,

56
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,500
not tonight.

57
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,350
My leg is injured.

58
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,470
Why don't you massage my leg?

59
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,810
Sure.

60
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,900
Thank you.

61
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,610
Your leg is injured,

62
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,060
so I should be looking after you.

63
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,410
Uncle Chen,

64
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,150
prepare a room for Jingxi.

65
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,070
She will be staying here for a while.

66
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,700
Of course.

67
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,010
Zhixing, let me explain.

68
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,490
It's not what you think at all.

69
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,300
I was unfaithful
because someone drugged me.

70
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,350
Go away.

71
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,450
Zhixing.

72
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,100
Zhixing,

73
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,340
can I upload this photo?

74
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,650
Do whatever you like.

75
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,130
Leng Zhixing, you scoundrel!

76
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,630
Zhixing.

77
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,710
Is this how you treat Miaomiao?

78
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,950
Are you okay?

79
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,350
It's a man's nature.

80
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,900
You understand, right?

81
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,340
Besides, can't you also tell?

82
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,390
The older sister is gentler
and more interesting in comparison.

83
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,190
Xia Miaomiao

84
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,580
cries all the time.

85
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,710
Besides,

86
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,460
the marriage certificate

87
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,380
already has mine and Jingxi's name on it.

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,740
Leng Zhixing,

89
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,990
don't regret this.

90
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,220
Zhixing, are you hurt?

91
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,710
Zhixing,

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,780
was everything you said true?

93
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,020
Do you really think my name is
on the marriage certificate

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,060
and want to marry me?

95
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,740
Shall we prepare for the wedding?

96
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,140
I've waited so long.

97
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,790
I don't want to keep on waiting anymore.

98
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,980
Okay, as you wish.

99
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,820
(Leng Zhixing from Leng Corporation)

100
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,100
(is days away from marrying Xia Jingxi,)

101
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,540
(the daughter from Xia Corporation.)

102
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,110
Don't even think about it.

103
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,380
Miaomiao.

104
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,970
This is my wedding invitation.

105
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,700
