2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,010
Miaomiao, give that to me.

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,970
I'll help you.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,100
It's fine, I can do it.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,640
Let's go.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,980
What are you doing?

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,770
Even if you're my cousin,

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,980
I cannot watch Miaomiao
live as a widow for you.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,370
It's no trouble if you want to join

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,500
Leng Medical project team.

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,370
It's none of your business.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,940
I will join the project team

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,670
on my own ability.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,050
Yuhang?

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,510
I'll complete the rest myself.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,550
It's just a foreign language.

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,390
I lived abroad for so many years,

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,770
how could I be worse than Lin Yuhang?

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,620
Just go to bed.

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,030
(What the hell?)

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,820
Boss.

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,130
This is the proposal from Leng Jiaxuan on
the cooperative development with Dihao Corporation.

23
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,720
Take a look.

24
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,310
Other than the values
I couldn't rectify in time,

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,600
the rest are exactly the same as mine.

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,200
Give the project to Leng Jiaxuan.

27
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,480
What? Why?

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,690
We'll beat him at his game.

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,170
Congratulations,

30
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,070
(Gao Village Land Auction)
Leng Jiaxuan from Leng Corporation

31
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,660
for winning the right
to develop this plot of land.

32
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,370
Miaomiao.

33
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,080
Pack up tonight.

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Come with me on a trip tomorrow.

35
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,340
Okay, sure.

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,720
Disgraceful!

37
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,340
Did you think I wouldn't know

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,590
that you stole Zhixing's plan

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,580
and won the cooperation with Dihao Corporation?

40
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,600
For the sake of fairness,

41
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,310
this competition is nullified.

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,070
Why?

43
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,180
Obviously, I got the project
with Dihao Corporation first.

44
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,030
Why are you still biased
toward Leng Zhixing?

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,410
Hello?

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,410
Leng Zhixing will go on
a business trip tomorrow.

47
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,370
Get rid of him for me.

48
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,900
They're here. Go!

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,010
I'll hold them back.

50
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,050
Get in the car.

51
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,310
Good thing I came in time.

52
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,690
Otherwise, are you going
to protect Miaomiao like this?

53
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,320
I knew you would come.

54
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,620
Zhixing, are you okay?

55
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,710
Zhixing.

56
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,880
How are you feeling?

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,710
Zhixing!

58
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,380
To the hospital.

59
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,100
Doctor, how is he?

60
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,890
He is fine.

61
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,930
He might have

62
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,350
lost consciousness due to
his post-traumatic stress disorder.

63
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,020
He'll be fine after some rest.

64
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,460
Okay.

65
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,770
Dad, Mom.

66
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,400
Zhixing, you're awake.

67
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,610
I'm here.

68
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,800
Miaomiao.

69
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,300
Don't you like exciting atmosphere?

70
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,050
This vegetable garden
is my present for you.

71
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,430
You can plant vegetables.

72
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,220
Other tyrant bosses would
give fish ponds or luxury cars,

73
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,970
but you give a vegetable garden?

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,020
Do you like it?

75
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,770
Yeah.

76
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,490
Ouch, Grandpa.

77
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,780
What are you doing?

78
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,910
Scoundrel!

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,260
You infuriate me.

80
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,830
You sent people
to attack Zhixing, didn't you?

81
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,290
I never imagine

82
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,950
you can be so cruel.

83
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,330
You're a disgrace!

84
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,790
Grandpa,

85
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,250
I told you.

86
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,170
I didn't try to assassinate Zhixing.

87
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,630
I only fought him because of Jingxi.

88
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,300
Grandpa,

89
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,010
I always keep your words in mind:

90
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,090
harmony in brotherhood.

91
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,590
Do you think I'm blind and senile?

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,010
I can see it clearly.

93
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,180
I'm telling you.

94
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,930
From now on,

95
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,270
you don't need

96
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,270
to manage this corporation anymore.

97
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,100
Get out.

98
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,810
Out.

99
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Get out now.

100
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,420
Get out of here.
