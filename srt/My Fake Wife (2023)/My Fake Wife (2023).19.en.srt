=My Fake Wife=
=Episode 19=

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,320
Get out!

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
What's so great about Xia Corp?

4
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,600
Xia Jingxi.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,460
Are you in such a hurry

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,600
to sleep with him?

7
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,300
Jingxi,

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,660
we must find Leng Jiaxuan

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,600
before we get married.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,340
Otherwise, there will be no peace

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,740
at our wedding and the rest of our lives.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,540
What should we do?

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,720
When Leng Jiaxuan finds out
we're getting married,

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,140
he will come look for you.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,740
When he does, you only need

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,200
to get the key and the evidence from him.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,100
Then you don't have
to fear Mo Sinian again.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
You'll have to do this

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,400
for our future.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,580
Then you must protect me.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,880
Of course.

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,300
What are you doing?

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Nothing.

24
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,700
I just missed you.

25
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,500
Jingxi.

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,120
How sly, Xia Jingxi.

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,140
You tricked me.

28
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,440
Zhixing,

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,460
I'm back.

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,820
Here are the evidence and key.

31
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,880
Let's go overseas now
and withdraw the money.

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,820
I've called the police.

33
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,220
Xia Jingxi,

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,420
it's time to end our game.

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,540
What do you mean?

36
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,100
I will never marry you.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,240
I said before,

38
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,140
my wife and I

39
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,740
will grow old together, hand-in-hand.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,900
Leng Zhixing, are you even a man?

41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,320
You would be with her
even though she has an affair

42
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,540
with Mo Sinian all the time?

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,320
Jingxi, I forgot to tell you.

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
Leng Zhixing is also Mo Sinian.

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,720
Liars.

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,300
You're both lying.

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,020
Luo Tian.

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,340
Bring me Mo Sinian's mask.

49
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,140
This was just for show.

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,400
This isn't true.

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,260
I don't believe it!

52
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,800
So, everything was just a joke. A joke!

53
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
Miaomiao,

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,260
I actually didn't want

55
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,560
to involve you in this matter.

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,660
That large sum of money
from Xia Foundation

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,000
and the money
Leng Jiaxuan transferred overseas

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,840
must not be lost.

59
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,740
I had to get them back.

60
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,440
But I didn't want to worry you.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,260
I'm sorry about this.

62
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,320
Oh, you.

63
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,640
Medical isn't for you.

64
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,460
You should study acting.

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,340
You too.

66
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,940
Jingxi, why have you gone mad?

67
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,520
I'll take you to the doctor.

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,640
It's all my fault.

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,900
It's my fault.

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,740
I shouldn't have

71
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,340
made you fight blindly
for money and status.

72
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,440
I was wrong.

73
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
How did you end up like this?

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,360
Daddy.

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,640
Mommy, that's Daddy.

76
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,540
Darling, don't go there.

77
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,820
Don't go there.

78
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,260
(This lane is closed)

79
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,560
Terrible news.

80
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,500
Someone drove into the basement car park
with explosives.

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,820
