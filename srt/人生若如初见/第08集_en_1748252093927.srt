1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Usually, it becomes a big part of your mission.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,020
But that's always happening.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,040
Trust me.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,640
What does the creditʻʻis related to?

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,240
How are people like them?

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,320
Who are they?

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,480
I wait for that.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,300
Wait, no.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,580
You'd like to come join my mission.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,700
I'm at work.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,700
The first time I saw a picture of a man in a black suit, I was surprised.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,700
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,700
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,700
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

15
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,700
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

16
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,700
He was wearing a black suit.

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,700
He was wearing a black suit.

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,700
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

19
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,700
The First Episode

20
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,700
He is not talking?

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,340
How can you be so honest?

22
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,380
This way, Mr. Lao will be scared to death.

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,660
This kind of scared to death?

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,660
Tell him that he will be scared to death.

25
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
You should know how to act.

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,100
What's the point of talking to him?

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,300
Don't say that he is strong.

28
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,460
Speaking of revolutionaryism,

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,300
the people of the Shuming family are despicable.

30
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,580
Where did my document go?

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,180
What document?

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,100
Zou Rong Xiong's new work.

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Yes, yes, yes.

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700
Here.

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,700
I've read a part for you.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,700
There is only one part.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
The sweepers,

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,700
thousands of people,

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,700
are specialized in politics.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Retreat.

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Thousands of people,

42
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
are hardworking,

43
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,700
and have a good life.

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
For 260 years,

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,700
they have been suffering from the great humiliation.

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Thinking of the great huhu of China,

47
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
has ruined it all.

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,700
It was the emperor'swin��

49
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
who convinced the bloodshed.

50
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
Thevantage of defence is home feet.

51
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,700
The enemy has killed all of them.

52
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
With 33 hills on the front street,

53
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,700
myself so gentle,

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
and long generally so uniform,

55
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,700
to subdue myself.

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,700
Sh Чеค פัว Jaeh H�

57
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Wei Wei is here.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
The revolution is also

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
panicking.

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Where is she?

61
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm not going to give you a bath.

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
Look at you. She's teaching you.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
You think you can hear her?

64
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,700
Of course she can't hear you.

65
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,700
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
She's 73 years old.

67
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,700
She used to paint for her own age.

68
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
She's been drinking for a long time.

69
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
She's never seen anything.

70
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
I have something else. I'll change it for you.

71
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Mr. Wu, I'm from the next door.

72
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
I made this pork belly for Miss Shu Hong.

73
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,700
Would you like to try it?

74
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Thank you so much.

75
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
This is a thin piece of pork belly.

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
It's so delicious.

77
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
It's not over yet.

78
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
It's delicious.

79
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
I'll go and check it out.

80
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
You don't have to go back.

81
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
She's beautiful.

82
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Try it.

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Mr. Du.

84
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
You're dressed so beautifully.

85
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Where's your mother?

86
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
She went to the clinic to see her.

87
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Your plate.

88
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
The pork belly your mother made is delicious.

89
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
What's on your hand?

90
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
You want to see?

91
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Then take it for me.

92
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Put it on the floor.

93
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Let's go.

94
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Chinese painting.

95
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
The painting of the village.

96
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
It's really good.

97
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
My guardian must like it.

98
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Guardian?

99
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Where can I buy it?

100
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
It's too expensive. You don't need to spend this money.

101
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Give it to me.

102
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Take this.

103
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Pull it.

104
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Why are you dressed so beautifully today?

105
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Today is my big day.

106
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
I just said goodbye to the whole team.

107
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I've spent half a year in the dance.

108
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Really? Then should I pour you a drink?

109
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Like a loyal prince.

110
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,700
Don't you think it's strange?

111
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
It's strange. Why?

112
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
If I'm not wrong,

113
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700
you and Mr. Wu

114
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
should be the political流 king of the East.

115
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
You have eyes.

116
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,700
I don't think he has any deep sense.

117
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
He's just an ordinary scholar.

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,700
You don't need to protect me.

119
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
In the East, there are three kinds of resistance

120
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
for each Chinese.

121
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Don't talk about revolution.

122
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
To be honest, I didn't understand this word.

123
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Isn't it simple?

124
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
To be honest, revolution is changing the dynasty.

125
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Changing the dynasty?

126
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Yes.

127
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
In this way, the great heart doesn't call the great heart.

128
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
What should we call it?

129
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
We should call it the great name.

130
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
You have to ask Mr. Wu about this.

131
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
He didn't see me.

132
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Did he see you?

133
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Yes.

134
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
You are so polite.

135
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
You are so kind.

136
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
What should we do?

137
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
We should meet each other.

138
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
You are a military scholar.

139
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Isn't it?

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Yes.

141
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
We can't change the military.

142
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
I came here to learn the eight words.

143
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
To correct the situation.

144
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
To save the country.

145
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Mr. Wu.

146
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Are all men willing to be the father of this country?

147
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,700
In my opinion,

148
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
it's not certain who will save the country.

149
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Congratulations on your life.

150
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Thank you for your mother's delicious white meat.

151
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Welcome back.

152
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Mr. Lin Cang is so polite.

153
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
You came here yourself.

154
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
I am sorry to make you do this.

155
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Really?

156
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
Actually, I have never been to Japan.

157
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Look at this.

158
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
It's a big mess.

159
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Did you see the girl next door?

160
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
You mean Mrs. Wu?

161
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
Mrs. Wu?

162
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
She is the Chinese woman next door.

163
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Why can't I hear the weird noise in your mouth?

164
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Weird noise?

165
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Where is the weird noise?

166
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Why didn't I hear that

167
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
she is Mr. Wu's wife?

168
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
It doesn't look like her.

169
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
I have been to their house.

170
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
I live here.

171
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
The boss told me that

172
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
they are the same age.

173
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Why do you know so well?

174
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Because I have a son.

175
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
I am a good girl.

176
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Of course, I have to be more considerate.

177
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Don't talk to me.

178
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Son,

179
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I think you two stand together.

180
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Good job.

181
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Mother,

182
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I will tell you.

183
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
In the Middle East,

184
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
there are nine Chinese people

185
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
who are blind to their own fate.

186
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
No way.

187
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
You don't think about it.

188
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
These years, the government has

189
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
established the country.

190
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
It's a Japanese society.

191
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Your son is also a good person.

192
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
You can talk nonsense.

193
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
You want revolution.

194
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
You don't hide the government.

195
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
You don't hide the ancestors.

196
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
You are a fool.

197
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
I am telling you.

198
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
If you keep making me hear you talk nonsense,

199
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
I will tear your mouth.

200
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
I will kill you.

201
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Mother,

202
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
I am also reminding you.

203
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Don't try to be yourself.

204
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
You are a daughter-in-law.

205
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
First,

206
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
I can't let you be a daughter-in-law.

207
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Second,

208
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,700
you are more capable than your son.

209
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
I will find a daughter-in-law for you

210
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
and give you a son and a daughter-in-law.

211
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Can you do that?

212
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
That's good.

213
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Why are you wearing such a shirt today?

214
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
It's raining.

215
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
It's raining.

216
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
It's raining.

217
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
I am not afraid of it.

218
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Don't talk nonsense.

219
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Come on.

220
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Hurry up.

221
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Go.

222
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Our food is over.

223
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
We don't need to wash the dishes.

224
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
We are done.

225
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Let's go out and drink together.

226
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Okay.

227
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Don't drink.

228
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
You forgot to make me do something.

229
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Let's drink together.

230
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Okay.

231
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Let's go.

232
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
What are you looking at?

233
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Why are you not sleeping?

234
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
You haven't seen me for days.

235
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
You are looking at me.

236
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
You are a little bit sleepy.

237
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Where are you not going?

238
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
Look.

239
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Where are you going?

240
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
I will give you a reward.

241
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
What?

242
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
You are not going to make trouble.

243
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
What?

244
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
It's the end of the fifth birthday.

245
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
We are now a band.

246
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Why are you still here?

247
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
No one is laughing at us.

248
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,700
We are going to sleep.

249
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
They are gone.

250
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
You are gone too?

251
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
You are going to be gone too?

252
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Qian.

253
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
You are going to be gone too?

254
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
I am not going to be gone.

255
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
It's not possible.

256
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
It's not convenient to be gone.

257
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
You are going to be gone twice.

258
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Look.

259
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
You are not going to be gone?

260
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
You are not going to be gone.

261
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
It's all your fault.

262
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
The meat is in the pot.

263
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Isn't it?

264
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,700
I said, you two should have a better idea.

265
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
You should cut it.

266
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,700
I will not cut it anyway.

267
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
I will not cut it either.

268
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
I am talking about you.

269
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Qian.

270
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
Stop.

271
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Qian.

272
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
We are going to leave.

273
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
We are going to leave.

274
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
I am happy.

275
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I am really happy.

276
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
I am really happy.

277
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Yes.

278
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
I think so too.

279
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Of course.

280
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,700
We will respect your culture and habits.

281
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,700
We will respect your choice.

282
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,700
The new study is about to start.

283
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,700
I can't be sure if you can make a decision.

284
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,700
But there is one thing I can make a decision.

285
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,700
The new study is about to start.

286
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
The hair is short.

287
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
It has nothing to do with it.

288
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Yuzhou.

289
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
He is so good at acting.

290
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
I heard he is a Chinese.

291
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
He is our instructor.

292
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,700
I saw the class.

293
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
He is teaching magic.

294
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Magic?

295
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Shi Xin.

296
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
We need to know each other.

297
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
What do we know each other?

298
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
These kind of magic are called signaling.

299
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Why is it called signaling?

300
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Magical white horse.

301
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Mu Xia has aMingWang.

302
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
He is a children's spirit.

303
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
His arm feels very weak.

304
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
He is the teacher.

305
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
He always be rude.

306
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Wind consumption is bad.

307
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Wood in human body is still in the work.

309
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Can I play the休息 in the muscle for you so I canamb me?

310
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,920
Go more!

311
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,800
Mr. Yang, I have to say something important!

312
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,880
Mr. Wang, I did not joke!

313
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,040
How can he only brag about his riding a bike?

314
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,540
Then today he'll carry something to the remedy room,

315
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,120
finally Batata copies his gesture.

316
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Chen Ding, run!

317
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,400

321
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
I'm not sure.

322
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Hey, Mr. E.

323
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
There's a wounded man here.

324
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
His horse might have been injured.

325
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Take him to the front.

326
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Take him to the ambulance.

327
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
I'm not sure.

328
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
You're not that bad.

329
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm not sure.

330
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
The horse was injured when it was on the horse.

331
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
You said you broke the record of the school.

332
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,240
You hurt yourself again in the shortest time.

333
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
I didn't ride it.

334
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
I always hold the bike.

335
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
If I don't, I'll climb up.

336
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
You're so brave.

337
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Come on.

338
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Tu Feng, what are you doing?

339
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
It's our Qiyin's treatment.

340
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
The school has enough medicine.

341
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
It's useless.

342
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,240
I can let you go to the mall three days later.

343
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Really?

344
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Lift your legs.

345
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Be gentle.

346
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
We've been riding the Qiyin's secret rooms for over 200 years.

347
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,240
In the past, the old Taihan and Nuan Ha were all cured like this.

348
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,240
You're the only one who can't lift your legs.

349
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm going to put the medicine on your legs.

350
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
It's a little cold.

351
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
It hurts.

352
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Wait a minute.

353
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Ka Zhi, lie down and have a drink.

354
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Don't care about anything.

355
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Take it easy.

356
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Ren Jun, hold her.

357
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Don't let her move.

358
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
You guys help her.

359
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
You shut up.

360
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
You shut up.

361
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Don't call me.

362
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Don't call me.

363
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Don't call me.

364
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
It hurts.

365
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
It really doesn't.

366
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
It's just a little scary.

367
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Look at you.

368
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
You're a whore and a whore.

369
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

370
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
You don't even know how to walk.

371
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

372
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

373
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
I'm just a whore.

374
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

375
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

376
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
That's enough.

377
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
We still have one more trick.

378
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
A trick to the horse.

379
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
A trick?

380
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,240
You guys are so good at making secrets.

381
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Don't worry.

382
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
How about you?

383
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
There's a small thing.

384
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
You can't leave without me.

385
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

386
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
You can't leave without me.

387
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

388
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
You don't even know how to walk.

389
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

390
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
You're just a whore and a whore.

391
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
GO VII

392
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Let their nose

393
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,620
received a breath

394
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620
let their ears heard the singing

395
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,580
let their eyes

396
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,300
let their tongue be the blending of metal

397
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,360
let the chain of metal stand

398
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,740
the leg of metal

399
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,040
it's still poorly made

400
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Let the horse father become the treasure of the city

401
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Let them be in the heart of the day

402
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Always very persistent

403
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
What are you two doing?

404
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Why is the horse good?

405
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
You are so good

406
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Don't you feel pain? Can you get off the bed?

407
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Can you get off?

408
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
It's a little bit of pain

409
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Don't be greedy

410
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,040
You should get off the bed early tomorrow morning

411
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Did I look wrong?

412
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Yang Kai-zhi

413
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
It's me, the officer

414
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
I thought you were still in the house

415
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
No, I'm here

416
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
It's weird

417
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Is the horse good?

418
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Yes

419
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
There will be people coming soon

420
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,040
I heard that you are a demon

421
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,040
You are really a good man

422
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Officer, it's not a demon

423
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
It's our ancestors' magic

424
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,040
The ancestors inside are very magical

425
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
But what about now?

426
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
The second day

427
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Wufeng

428
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Don't be too sad

429
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
I'm crying

430
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
I didn't expect that the Japanese officer

431
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
would come here so suddenly

432
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
How can he not be sad?

433
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,040
He is very strong

434
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Look at the Japanese army

435
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Even the Crown Prince is not surprised

436
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
He is also fighting on the grass

437
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
But what about us?

438
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
You Japanese officers

439
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
are so timid

440
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Mother

441
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Did he say anything?

442
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Officer, is that what our ancestors said?

443
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Mother

444
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Did he say anything?

445
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
It's a bit hard to say

446
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
in other people's mouth

447
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
In Manchurian

448
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
We are fighting in the old Taihan

449
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,040
The top is very smart

450
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
The bottom is very stupid

451
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
So

452
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,040
We have achieved the 200 years of our country

453
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Didn't the singer say that?

454
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
The top is too smart

455
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
He doesn't want to go out and make money

456
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
The bottom is also smart

457
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
He doesn't want to go out and make money

458
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
That's it

459
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Now

460
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
The current Qing Dynasty

461
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
is also the top and bottom

462
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
They are all smart

463
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
How can they be strong?

464
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Son

465
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Don't feel wronged

466
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Let people scold you

467
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
If you want to go out

468
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
You have to admit it

469
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
I know it

470
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I have to be strong

471
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,040
I want to invite you and your husband

472
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,040
to a tea

473
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Yes

474
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Please stop at that shop

475
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Yes, thank you

476
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Mother, I have to buy some gifts

477
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
for the third son

478
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Thank you

479
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Thank you

480
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Hello

481
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Are you Chinese?

482
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Yes

483
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,040
These are all Chinese products

484
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
The most famous

485
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Hu Bi, Duan Yan, Huimeng, Xuan Ji

486
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Look at you

487
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Thank you

488
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
This is good

489
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
It's just a little bit more like a blessing

490
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
Is there a bigger blessing?

491
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Can you cover it?

492
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Of course

493
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
You can do it

494
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
You can cover it

495
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
That's good

496
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
You can add some more grapes

497
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
It's all in one place

498
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
In our shop

499
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Ziteng and grapes are always

500
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
on the same shelf

501
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
The purple flowers and grapes

502
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Not only the moon, they are also very appreciate

503
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Oh, I believe you

504
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
That girl hasn't returned yet?

505
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,040
That girl is taking a picture of Mr. Ju An

506
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Oh, I see

507
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
It's a signature

508
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
New version

509
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Is it grapes?

510
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
Yes

511
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
I see

512
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
You go there first

513
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
and call some orders

514
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Okay

515
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Thank you

516
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
I'm going

517
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Look at Mr. Chu Ren's business map

518
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Come here

519
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
The customer is stupid

520
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,040
It's bigger than this

521
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
More, more

522
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Yes

523
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
The beach is bigger

524
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
It's bigger

525
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
I see

526
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
It's a piece of cake

527
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
It's a piece of cake

528
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
It's good

529
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Wait

530
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Let's go

531
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
This is it

532
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Look at this

533
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
This is it

534
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
The grape and purple flower of the second-hand fashion

535
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Yes

536
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Oh my god

537
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
The second-hand fashion of the Cai Guang Qi

538
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
You have to go to the heaven

539
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
You must not draw

540
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
How much is it?

541
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
The owner just left

542
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
You have to give me a heart

543
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I brought you some good luck

544
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Be gentle

545
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Thank you

546
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
It's a little bitter

547
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
My dad is sour?

548
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Mom, I want to talk to you

549
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
I heard from your son

550
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
that he will not sell his blood

551
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
using the blood

552
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
He will not use the blood

553
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Will you sell me?

554
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Okay, I will do it

555
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
The land of the East mountain

556
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
is also in the West mountain

557
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
It will not be zero

558
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Why?

559
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Because

560
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
I arrived in the East

561
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
I can't catch the breath

562
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
This is also a land

563
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
and a god

564
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
I want to talk to you

565
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
I want to talk to you

566
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
My father is a teacher

567
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
He is a teacher

568
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
and I am a teacher

569
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
I am sorry

570
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
But

571
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
If the new country

572
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
has experienced a great loss

573
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
I think

574
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
the land of the East mountain

575
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
will be zero

576
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Please let me know

577
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
about the politics

578
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
That's right

579
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
I will go to the hospital

580
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
and take a shower

581
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Come

582
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
My son is very bitter

583
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Can you see it?

584
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
This is not allowed

585
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
My son, we can't eat

586
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
You listen to him

587
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
and talk to him

588
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Let's go

589
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
Is this a secret?

590
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Is there any mistake?

591
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
The master bought it

592
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
from the East mountain

593
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
If you ask

594
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Is it from the Chinese palace?

595
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Let me see

596
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
This is not a palace

597
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
This is a private house

598
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
The bracelet in the palace

599
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
is made of a net

600
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
It looks like a beautiful model

601
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
It is a good thing

602
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
It is a good thing

603
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
It is good

604
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
My son, tell them

605
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
This is a poem from the people

606
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
It is written in the book

607
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
It is written in the book

608
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
It is written in the book

609
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
It is written in the book

610
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
This is not

611
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
a brother's house

612
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
It is a house

613
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Well

614
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
I finally met the expert

615
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Yes

616
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
It was really good

617
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
not to be a Chinese palace

618
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Without Sao

619
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
I would not have been in a hurry

620
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Mr. Liu

621
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Please eat this

622
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
to your mother

623
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
This is what I made

624
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
This is delicious

625
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Mother

626
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Why are you so silent?

627
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
What are you talking about?

628
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
That bracelet

629
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
I recognized it

630
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
It is a palace

631
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
The palace's evidence

632
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
That is nonsense

633
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
I saw it

634
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
when I saw it

635
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
when I saw it

636
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
It is also

637
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
It is hard to get a bite

638
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
It is hard to get a bite

639
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
But you just said

640
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Is it fake?

641
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
I want to say it is true

642
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
We still have the face

643
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
to drink tea there

644
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
What is the same smell and smell

645
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
Can't recognize

646
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
Can't recognize this smell

647
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
Really big

648
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
It is slow and autumn

649
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
There is also a fish

650
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
I saw the wallet

651
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
I still have a boss

652
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
who is so kind to me

653
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
What do you eat?

654
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Eat, eat

655
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
Pour me some

656
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
So kind

657
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
Why are you looking at me like that?

658
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Your boss

659
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
Is it also a painter?

660
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
You are scolding me

661
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Maybe it is a Japanese royal garden

662
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Really?

663
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
I think

664
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
You said Hong really met a good boss

665
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
You should drink a little

666
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
You are so honest

667
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
You are so kind

668
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
You are so generous

669
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
But you have to spend a lot of money

670
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
What do you think?

671
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Really spicy

672
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Really spicy

673
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
I have a good news

674
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
for you

675
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
China's commercial bank is in charge of the bank

676
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
We changed a new method

677
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
According to the Japanese market

678
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
The market is full of people

679
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
It is the same

680
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,040
People

681
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
You have to understand me

682
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
I am the chairman of the business meeting

683
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
But in the commercial bank

684
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I am a chairman

685
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
I have to buy everything

686
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
I have to say

687
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,040
He is the big boss

688
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
He has 16 million dollars

689
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
I understand

690
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
But Sheng Xuanhuai has dozens of employees

691
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
But he is also a rich man

692
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
What to say

693
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
What do you need me for?

694
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Do you know

695
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
What?

696
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
The bank is damaged

697
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
It is not

698
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Sheng Hai didn't tell me

699
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
What he said to you

700
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
is the problem of the rich

701
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
The bank is in charge

702
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
What is the charge of the bank?

703
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
Now there is a limit

704
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
The Japanese

705
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
The bank is willing to invest

706
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
It's a good chance

707
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Sheng Kongbao just doesn't agree

708
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Zhou Konglin also owes him

709
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Don't be so arrogant

710
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
You have to live

711
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Right?

712
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,040
Of course

713
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Such a big thing

714
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Can't live

715
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Sheng Xuanhuai is right

716
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
The great China

717
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
Just our one dollar bank

718
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
Can't let the Japanese

719
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
In our eyes

720
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
It's all blown

721
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Welcome

722
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
I am Takeshita

723
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
Welcome to the bank

724
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
Please come in

725
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Please come in

726
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Please come in

727
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
President

728
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
I am the bank owner

729
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
President

730
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Is everything new?

731
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
We don't use the bank

732
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
to buy the work

733
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
If the customer

734
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
wants to buy the work

735
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Can you sell it?

736
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,040
How much

737
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
I can give you

738
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I wonder

739
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
President Kaeyama

740
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
How was it?

741
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I have a customer

742
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
I have a customer

743
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
who has the same hobby

744
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
as you

745
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
I don't have

746
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
If you want to give me money

747
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Please tell me

748
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
I don't have

749
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I don't have

750
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
I don't have

751
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
I don't have

752
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
Please tell me

753
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
As long as it's not a big deal

754
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
This is also

755
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
the first time I've ever seen it

756
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,040
But

757
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
This is a dangerous bridge

758
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
Please don't worry

759
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
President Kaeyama

760
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
In Japan's law

761
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
The peace of the other countries

762
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Which incurs the yogurt

763
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
is a multinational

764
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
project

765
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Please think about it

766
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
Dang,

767
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
