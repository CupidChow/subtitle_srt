1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,040
Cool framerate

2
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,040
The first time I saw a picture of a man in a black suit, I was surprised.

3
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

4
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

5
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

7
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

8
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

9
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

10
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

11
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

12
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,040
The first time I saw a picture of a man in a black suit, I was surprised.

13
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

14
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I was surprised that he was wearing a black suit.

16
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Are you okay?

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm fine.

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,080
Yes.

19
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
Eat it.

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,080
Eat.

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
Are you still my boss?

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
What do you promise?

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Like now, I'll eat alone with the royal family.

24
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
That's not the first time.

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Who else?

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Your mother.

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Isn't that so?

28
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
She often mentioned you in the Songzhu Hotel.

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Your mother said many things about you.

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Really?

31
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,960
It's all about the acting.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
It's interesting.

33
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Why did she mention you?

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
I don't know.

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Liang Xia, if you don't have the royal family's interests,

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
she's also a young girl.

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Young girl?

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
I'm just a young girl in your eyes.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,960
How do you want me to look at you?

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,960
What do you think I should look at you?

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Whatever you want.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,960
As long as you don't treat me as a young girl who is not respected in the royal family.

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
You still care about me?

44
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Let me tell you.

45
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Why did we come to Japan?

46
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,960
We came here to ask for the new Wanjiu Nationality, right?

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Your relative, Yang Yifan, just got on a plane in a meeting.

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Yes, we have a different understanding.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,960
But on the point of Wanjiu Nationality, we are the same.

50
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,960
You're so smart, Liang Xia.

51
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
You're not even smiling at all.

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
You're making fun of me.

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
No.

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm just thinking.

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Where will you be in ten years?

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
In the Jinlun Hall in Zijin City?

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,960
You're only interested in me ten years later.

58
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Not me, but Yang Yifan, who is not respected in Japan.

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,960
After all, you're their rival.

60
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Are you saying that these two people are too much of an influence?

61
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Why would a girl like you take this wedding water?

62
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
What is it? Revolution, reformation, and renunciation?

63
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Do you understand?

64
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
I have a batch of wedding dresses in my shop.

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm not interested.

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
You don't want to pick a few for the royal family?

67
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,960
During the war, I'm afraid they don't have that kind of personality.

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
You like to fight.

69
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
What's wrong with you?

70
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
You don't do business with a fight.

71
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,960
You also have to eat and sleep, write and do articles.

72
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
What are you laughing at?

73
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
What is this?

74
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
The words in the jade.

75
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Which words?

76
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
The words of life.

77
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
The words of life?

78
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Hey, look outside.

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
There are some people outside.

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,960
It seems like a child has jumped into the sea.

81
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Really?

82
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
That's why...

83
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm afraid.

84
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Excuse me.

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
What's wrong?

86
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
I don't know what's going on.

87
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
What happened?

88
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
There is a Chinese student.

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
He committed suicide.

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
He said he wore a white dress.

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
He wrote on his clothes.

92
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
He was a Japanese government official.

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Is that so?

94
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,960
In this world, there is nothing.

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,960
You are not just a student.

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
I'm not a student.

97
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
I'm a teacher.

98
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm a teacher.

99
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
I'm a teacher.

100
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm a teacher.

101
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm a teacher.

102
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
I'm a teacher.

103
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I'm a teacher.

104
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm a teacher.

105
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm a teacher.

106
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
I'm a teacher.

107
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I'm a teacher.

108
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
I'm a teacher.

109
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I'm a teacher.

110
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
I'm a teacher.

111
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Where did you go last night?

112
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
You wore a white dress.

113
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Can you give me some freedom?

114
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
It's not your business anymore, you see.

115
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,960
The circumstances and prices of the gun are all up to you.

116
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,960
One gun, 15 yuan.

117
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
What's wrong?

118
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
What's wrong?

119
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Why are you always so proud?

120
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
You're not happy?

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Why should I be happy?

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I'm in a place that's 200 meters away from me.

123
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
I can jump.

124
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
The police found a book on it.

125
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
The dead is called Zhang Yanming.

126
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Zhang Yanming?

127
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Is it true?

128
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
You said the dead is called Zhang Yanming?

129
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
That's not true.

130
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
The body was found by the police.

131
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
The body was found by the police.

132
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Yanming...

133
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
He... He jumped.

134
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Why is he not feeling well these days?

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
He's a liar.

136
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
He's a liar.

137
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
I... I don't know him.

138
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
He's been with me all day.

139
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
You said you knew him.

140
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Where are you going?

141
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I can't go.

142
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm going to find your brother-in-law.

143
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
He's a liar.

144
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
He's a good liar.

145
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
A good liar?

146
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Yes, a good liar.

147
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Let me tell you.

148
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
No one can be a good liar.

149
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
But without a good liar,

150
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
there's no way we can beat him.

151
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
You're finally back.

152
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Brother Tu Fang, come here.

153
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
You should also persuade him.

154
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
What's the problem?

155
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
There are other women in the world except Li Zhuji.

156
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
How can I persuade women?

157
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
You should also persuade them.

158
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
I think you should learn from them.

159
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
You should be able to find a good liar.

160
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
That's not true.

161
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
A man is really a good liar.

162
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
I love you.

163
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
I love you?

164
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I'm fine.

165
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
I can't control you.

166
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
I can't control you.

167
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
You're just kidding me.

168
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
I can't see it.

169
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
I'm kidding you.

170
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
You know Japanese people are so cruel.

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
I have something to tell you.

172
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
He's a real liar.

173
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Liang Xiang, you don't have to laugh.

174
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
You don't have to laugh.

175
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Maybe one day,

176
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
your Huangzu family will be in trouble.

177
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Maybe it's not as good as them.

178
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Why do you say that you're here because of your brother?

179
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
It's okay.

180
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Let him say it.

181
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
He's a good liar.

182
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm not sure if he's a good liar.

183
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
How can he persuade you

184
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
if you're like this?

185
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Exactly.

186
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Kaizhi.

187
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
It's not like you.

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
You're a good liar.

189
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Don't touch me.

190
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm telling you,

191
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Kaizhi,

192
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I don't like to make excuses.

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm not good at it.

194
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
But I want to ask you one thing.

195
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Why are you here in the East?

196
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Don't come here.

197
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
You're not here.

198
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
We're not here.

199
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Right?

200
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Who are you?

201
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I know better than anyone.

202
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
We met for the first time.

203
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
You're a good liar.

204
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
We met for the first time in Jinzhou.

205
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
You were a good liar.

206
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
You had a lot of great dreams

207
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
in your head.

208
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
You're a good liar.

209
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
If you want me to say it,

210
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
you're a bad liar.

211
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
That's not true.

212
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
No matter who you are,

213
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
what kind of person you are,

214
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
the old man,

215
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
the old man,

216
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
you said you

217
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
went to the gym.

218
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
The hero is short.

219
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
No way.

220
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
You're not like that, right?

221
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Yes.

222
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
You're wearing a red hat.

223
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm not wearing any hat.

224
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I agree with your point of view.

225
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
The current China

226
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
has completely lost its power to control the power of the new power.

227
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
The power of the new power has completely lost its power to control the power of the new power.

228
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
It's obvious that the power of the new power has completely lost its power to control the power of the new power.

229
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Now, we've made a big deal in Liaodong.

230
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
What can the government do?

231
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
The government has done nothing.

232
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
It can't do anything.

233
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
How many things can we do in return?

234
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Right?

235
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Yes.

236
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
That's right.

237
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
I'll help you.

238
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Chonggong,

239
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
you didn't just say that you're a soldier.

240
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
The whole court is here to save the future soldiers.

241
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Begin.

242
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
We have to listen.

243
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
When this guy is cold-blooded,

244
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
we'll be able to make a profit.

245
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
This is what we're doing.

246
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
We're doing this for the future soldiers.

247
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
We're doing this for the future soldiers.

248
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
We're doing this for the future soldiers.

249
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
We're doing this for the future soldiers.

250
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
This is the biggest support for our brother, Tu Fang.

251
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
This is the biggest support for our brother, Tu Fang.

252
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
When he becomes the general manager,

253
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
we'll listen to him.

254
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Stop talking nonsense.

255
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
You're over it.

256
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Your brother,

257
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
you really have this ambition

258
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
for the future soldiers.

259
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Let's put it this way.

260
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I don't know what they'll do to me

261
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
after I return to the country.

262
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
But I know what I should do.

263
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
If you're going to make a profit,

264
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
I'll do it for you.

265
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
I'll do it for you.

266
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I don't think so.

267
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I don't think so.

268
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I'll do it for you.

269
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Since you've said it like this,

270
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
what else can we say?

271
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Right,

272
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
it's right to listen to him now.

273
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
No, no, no.

274
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
You really have to make a decision

275
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
after you make a decision.

276
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Yes,

277
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
you really have to make a decision.

278
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,960
We should finish the studies first.

279
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
We should get the military documents,

280
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,960
return to the country, build the military and the national defense.

281
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
We should do this as a basis.

282
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
No matter if it's a mess or an enemy,

283
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,960
it's not the ones who can win the victory over the誇話 group.

284
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
We can't do it.

285
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
That's right.

286
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
That's right.

287
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Then we are sure to win.

288
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
We will win again.

289
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
We should be careful.

290
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
When we return to the country,

291
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
we will have half a year of experience in the cold.

292
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
We can't lose our brotherhood.

293
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
We will do our best.

294
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
We will do our best.

295
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,960
The Liojunko is one of the most important Minatoes in Asia.

296
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,960
It is also called the Zibraltar of the East.

297
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Minatoes are surrounded by mountains.

298
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
There are the Tories and the Borders

299
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,960
that the Minatoes have developed.

300
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Later, the Russian army was re-enacted

301
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
by the Russian forces.

302
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
It became the enemy's job.

303
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
The Japanese army's third army

304
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,960
has only one way to win the Liojunko.

305
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,960
The only way is to use the cannon.

306
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
And the cannon.

307
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
According to the story,

308
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,960
in Osaka, there are already 18,280,000 cannon-gunners

309
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
that are going to attack the Liojunko.

310
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
280,000?

311
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,960
The cannon that is the biggest cannon in the world?

312
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
To take it out?

313
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Yes.

314
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
In order to take out that cannon,

315
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
we must use the special rail.

316
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
I report.

317
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Yes, sir.

318
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Yes, sir.

319
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
I am sorry to disturb you.

320
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I am sorry.

321
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
I heard from the housekeeper

322
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
that the Lin Cang people

323
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
have reported the situation of the front line

324
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
to you personally.

325
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I am not here to discuss war with you.

326
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,960
This is not a student who can do anything.

327
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I am listening to you.

328
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,960
I want to ask you to help a private person.

329
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
What is it?

330
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
My classmate, Yan Kai-zhi,

331
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
is a very valuable person to me.

332
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Yuan Xia,

333
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
I advise you

334
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
not to bother this person anymore.

335
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I can't care about you.

336
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Then who can?

337
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Last time,

338
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
the police in Tokyo were not in charge.

339
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Then who is it?

340
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
It is about the safety of the Japanese country.

341
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Who do you think it is?

342
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
I understand.

343
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
This Kai-zhi

344
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,960
has a secret relationship with

345
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
the King of Liu's Tokyo.

346
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
I am not very clear about this.

347
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
I advise you

348
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
not to talk to him anymore.

349
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
If you don't help me,

350
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
I will go to find the Lin Cang.

351
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
I will tell him

352
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
that if this person

353
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
is handled by your secret police,

354
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
that will be the Japanese's humiliation.

355
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Fine.

356
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
The rain that you said

357
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
has already rained

358
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
on the military's spiritual cultivation.

359
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Okay.

360
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
I will help you to find the master.

361
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
But I still have to remind you

362
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
that this person is useful.

363
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
You have to be careful.

364
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Okay.

365
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Please come in.

366
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
We got the intelligence money

367
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
that you gave to Shanghai.

368
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Did you receive it?

369
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Yes.

370
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Are you satisfied?

371
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
But

372
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
we are not satisfied

373
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,960
with your intelligence.

374
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
What do you mean?

375
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Do you have any information?

376
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
For example, Yang Kai-zhi.

377
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
He seems to be very quiet

378
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
in your intelligence.

379
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Mr. Meng.

380
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
I understand that

381
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
there is a saying

382
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
that you can't be satisfied.

383
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
I, Li Neng Jun,

384
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
have a saying that you can't be satisfied.

385
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
You can't always be satisfied.

386
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
I didn't mean that.

387
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
What do you mean?

388
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Mr. Meng.

389
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I, Li Neng Jun,

390
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
don't need this money.

391
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Meigui is holding a grudge

392
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
and I don't want to do it.

393
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Brother Qian Li.

394
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Don't worry about this.

395
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Because of this,

396
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
only you and I know.

397
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Can you not worry?

398
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
According to the intelligence

399
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
of your Shanghai Island,

400
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
all Chinese people in Japan

401
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
can be listed on the list.

402
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
How about this?

403
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
The general intelligence

404
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
will not bother you

405
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
from now on.

406
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
In the future,

407
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
you can only do

408
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
special intelligence.

409
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
What's the news?

410
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
In the East China Sea,

411
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
we seem to be in danger.

412
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
We know that

413
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
a secret weapon

414
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
is sent to the island.

415
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
We want to know

416
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
which messes

417
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
the island is in.

418
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
And we want to know

419
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
how they

420
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
took these weapons

421
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,960
from the East China Sea.

422
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Stand up.

423
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Stand up.

424
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Stand up.

425
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Meng.

426
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
You can see it clearly.

427
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
This is the East China Sea.

428
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
These weapons are outside.

429
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
If they are all on your list,

430
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm afraid you can't deal with them.

431
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
So,

432
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
today in the next month,

433
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
you'd better stay here.

434
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
I don't have this kind of anger in me.

435
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
I can't stand it.

436
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Brother Qian Li.

437
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Brother Qian Li.

438
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Brother Qian Li.

439
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Brother Qian Li.

440
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Brother Qian Li.

441
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Brother Qian Li.

442
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
Brother Qian Li.

443
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Brother Qian Li.

444
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Brother Qian Li.

445
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Brother Qian Li.

446
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Brother Qian Li.

447
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Why are you here?

448
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Xiaodi is doing well.

449
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
You're good.

450
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Last time I met you,

451
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
you were selling flowers in the big house.

452
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
You have to thank me.

453
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
What's the matter?

454
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Someone asked me to help you

455
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
to cut a batch of guns.

456
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
I'm here to inform you

457
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
to take back the location.

458
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
What's this?

459
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
This is a goods certificate.

460
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
After you take this to the ship,

461
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
find a second father.

462
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
That's Erlan.

463
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
What's Erlan?

464
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Golden hair.

465
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Blue eyes.

466
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Keep the beard.

467
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Fall off the lake.

468
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Can he understand what I'm saying?

469
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Gun.

470
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
He speaks English.

471
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
But you have this.

472
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
You give him this.

473
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
He'll know everything.

474
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
I know.

475
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
It's a ship from the United States.

476
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
The Marguerite Princess.

477
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
She lives on the third port of the East Bank.

478
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Remember.

479
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
The goods are packed.

480
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
One box of weapons.

481
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Three boxes of guns.

482
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
It's from the Hengbin.

483
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Only 15?

484
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Isn't it 300?

485
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
You think it's a silver medal?

486
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
That's it.

487
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
The moon of the leader is safe.

488
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Then our money

489
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
can only be paid by the leader.

490
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
That's not good.

491
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I've told you.

492
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
We must pay once.

493
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Then you can guarantee that I'll pay

494
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
and receive all the goods.

495
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Don't worry about that.

496
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
There's a bank guarantee.

497
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Bank?

498
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
You don't know.

499
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Your payment is transferred

500
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
by the Chinese Bank of the East Bank.

501
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
That's it.

502
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
At seven o'clock in the evening,

503
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
you can go to the shipyard

504
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
and wait for your delivery.

505
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
I'll come over to help you.

506
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Let's go.

507
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Bank?

508
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
This is a bank.

509
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Bank.

510
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Mr. Li, leave the car.

511
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Lin Jing,

512
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
go to the mountains with me to pick up the goods.

513
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Okay.

514
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Mr. Li,

515
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
go to the mountains with me to pick up the goods.

516
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Okay.

517
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

518
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Okay.

519
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

520
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Okay.

521
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

522
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Okay.

523
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

524
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Okay.

525
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

526
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Okay.

527
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

528
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Okay.

529
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

530
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Okay.

531
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

532
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Okay.

533
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
I'll go to the mountains with you to pick up the goods.

534
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Okay.

535
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Okay.

536
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Fire! Fire!

537
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Fire!

538
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Who are you?

539
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
What are you doing?

540
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Take the boat to this side.

541
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
This way.

542
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Damn it.

543
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Fire!

544
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Fire!

545
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Fire!

546
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Fire!

547
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Fire!

548
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Fire!

549
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Fire!

550
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
What are you doing?

551
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm sending the goods to this address.

552
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Okay.

553
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Let's go.

554
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Okay.

555
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
This is not easy.

556
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,960
I can't understand this at all.

557
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
What should I do?

558
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
You can't go there.

559
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
You give me the kid from the library.

560
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
He's a student.

561
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Who are you looking for?

562
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Renren, listen to me.

563
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
This is a big deal.

564
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
I'll give you the money later.

565
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
I won't give you the goods anymore.

566
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
You won't give me the goods?

567
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
What's the way to deal with the goods?

568
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
But we can't pay the money.

569
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,960
You're the one who put the money in the bank.

570
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
I can't get it out of you.

571
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Then we'll pay it back.

572
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Yes.

573
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,960
I guess I can't even afford to pay the house.

574
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
That's the way it is.

575
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Don't worry.

576
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
I'll figure it out.

577
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
What do you want?

578
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
How much money do you want?

579
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
You figure it out.

580
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
You've thought it all out.

581
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
I'm worried about you.

582
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I'll take care of the rest.

583
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Overseas Health

584
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:15,300
TRUE

585
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
What's wrong with the code?

586
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,300
What's wrong?

587
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,300
You think it's too big?

588
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,300
How can the American swim in the water?

589
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm a kid.

590
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
The news is good.

591
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
Mom, you said that the Tongxiang is Shanghai.

592
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
Can't you understand the joke?

593
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,300
You have something to do with Shanghai.

594
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Tongxiang?

595
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
It's just Tongxiang.

596
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
You Li Renjun.

597
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
Won't you keep following me?

598
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,300
I'm following you.

599
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,300
You're the lucky one.

600
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,300
In exchange, the black guy took this job.

601
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Your mother is afraid to be full of people.

602
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
The river is on fire.

603
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
Thank you for helping us.

604
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,220
I'm sorry.

605
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
I'm sorry.

606
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,220
I'm sorry.

607
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
I'm sorry.

608
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,220
I'm sorry.

609
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
Shu Huang.

610
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
What's the matter?

611
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,220
I've already taken the gun.

612
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
I can't use it anymore.

613
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
Who's the chief?

614
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Don't bother.

615
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Feng Sheng, don't come here.

616
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
We can deal with it ourselves.

617
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
I'm sorry.

618
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
I'm sorry.

619
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,220
I'm sorry.

620
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,220
You scared me.

621
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,220
Why?

622
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,220
Why did you do this to me?

623
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
What's the matter, Tian Bai?

624
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
Zi Da.

625
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,220
Zi Da hurt my lower lip.

626
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm going to die.

627
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
Die.

628
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
Don't cry.

629
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,220
My god.

630
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
That's a special treatment.

631
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,220
I'm so confused.

632
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Are you?

633
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,220
I don't feel anything.

634
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,140
I can't understand anything.

635
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,140
What's wrong with you?

636
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,140
I have to wipe it out all my life.

637
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,140
I...

638
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
I'm so sad.

639
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
My lord.

640
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
I'm so sorry.

641
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,140
What's wrong with you?

642
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,060
Why?

643
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,060
Why is it me?

644
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,060
Why?

645
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,060
Why?

646
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Why?

647
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
Why?

648
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,060
Why?

649
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Why?

650
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,060
I can't live without you.

651
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Why?

652
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,980
Why?

653
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,980
Why?

654
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,980
Why?

655
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Why?

656
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980
Why?

657
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
It's so strange.

658
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
My god.

659
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
What's wrong?

660
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,980
Zi Da hurt my lower lip.

661
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,940
You can't believe it?

662
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,940
You are lying to me.

663
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
Who can think of it?

664
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,940
I am in the Great Wall.

665
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
I have spent a lot of money.

666
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,940
I have no money to repay.

667
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,940
Boss Guan Shan,

668
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,940
you are old, you can't take care of yourself.

669
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
I love you.

670
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
You?

671
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,940
No, no, no.

672
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,940
Shuhong,

673
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
I am afraid that you are an old man.

674
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,940
It's not like that.

675
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
I can't take care of myself.

676
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,940
I am afraid that you are an old man.

677
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
Shuhong,

678
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,940
if I were to give you the order,

679
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,940
I wouldn't take a single penny.

680
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,940
For example, in China,

681
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,940
in Japan,

682
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,940
what can a married woman do?

683
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
Boss Guan Shan,

684
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,940
I can do whatever Mr. Wu can do.

685
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,940
You are a student?

686
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Don't worry about that.

687
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
The store has hired a female customer

688
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
to buy a wheelchair.

689
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,940
Besides the new seat,

690
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
Mr. Wu is still a new customer.

691
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,940
That's enough.

692
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,940
What else can I do?

693
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,940
I can only think of a way.

694
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
So,

695
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
that means

696
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
that the investment...

697
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
I said it.

698
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,940
I will take this account.

699
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,940
But,

700
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,940
can you let the workers

701
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,940
first unlock the currency in our bank?

702
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,940
In the bank,

703
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
you can't understand it.

704
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,940
I can't understand it either.

705
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
This is not my

706
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,940
blood sample.

707
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,940
It's like a bottle of blood.

708
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,940
It's safe and sound.

709
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
The more you unlock it, the more you will be able to understand.

710
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,940
Do you understand?

711
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
What can I do?

712
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
What should I do?

713
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
If the goods are broken,

714
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
the money will be gone.

715
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I like this scene.

716
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
The birds are flying.

717
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
The people are all dead.

718
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,940
You are right.

719
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
You should take your time

720
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,940
to think of a way.

721
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
Kego.

722
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,940
Kego.

723
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
Yes.

724
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Kego.

725
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Yes.

726
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,940
Where is Shogo?

727
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,940
He left.

728
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
He was just in the back.

729
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
He didn't know where he was.

730
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
I'll go get him.

731
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
It's okay.

732
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,940
You can have the money.

733
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,940
But, sir...

734
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,940
It's just money.

735
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,940
You can't understand it.

736
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,940
Yes.

737
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,940
Sir.

738
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,940
I understand, sir.

739
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,940
I'm glad to be able to teach you

740
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,940
the Yokin and Kouza of the Rijuki-sama.

741
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
Do you mind?

742
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
No, thank you.

743
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
Please don't do that.

744
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
But, this Yokin

745
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
was finally saved from the school

746
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,940
from the beginning of the year.

747
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
It's okay.

748
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,940
Please take everything

749
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,940
other than the money used as a school loan.

750
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
I understand.

751
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Please wait for a while.

752
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,940
I'll see you later.

753
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,940
Please.

754
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,940
Thank you.

755
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Here you go.

756
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940
Sir.

757
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,940
The Yokin is worth

758
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,940
$5,100 for the Yokin.

759
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,940
But, this Yokin

760
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,940
is not something

761
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,940
that can be used

762
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,940
without the help of

763
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,940
another company.

764
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
No, it's not.

765
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,940
Excuse me.

766
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,940
Do you want to take this?

767
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,940
Of course, it's possible.

768
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
Do you want to borrow the Yokin?

769
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,940
Can you do it?

770
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,940
I'm sorry.

771
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,940
The Yokin is worth more than

772
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,940
the Yokin

773
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,940
that is used as a school loan.

774
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,940
I can't do it.

775
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,940
The Yokin can only be used

776
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,940
for $1,500.

777
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
It's okay.

778
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,940
It's okay to borrow the Yokin.

779
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,940
Then,

780
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,940
please take one by one

781
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,940
and pay the Yokin.

782
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,940
Excuse me.

783
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,940
I'd like to borrow the Yokin.

784
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Please.

785
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,940
Please take your seat, Mr. Kocho.

786
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
Well,

787
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
I've heard that

788
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,940
you opened a shop before.

789
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,940
It seems that your business is

790
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
being reduced.

791
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,940
How much is it?

792
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,940
It's $1,500.

793
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,940
It's a little less than that.

794
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,940
The factory seems to be doing well.

795
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,940
Are you doing well in the past?

796
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,940
Mr. Kocho,

797
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,940
the continuation is over.

798
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,940
This girl is my student.

799
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,940
Why did you come here?

800
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,940
See you later, Mr. Shukoku.

801
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,940
If you have time,

802
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,940
come to school.

803
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
Bye.
