1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
discovered in the light of the day

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,760
Touhou stage

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,720
Touhou

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,660
Touhou

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 1

6
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,400
Look at the sunset.

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,200
It's beautiful.

8
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
The shop is beautiful.

9
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,680
Where did you go?

10
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,240
My brother-in-law asked me to go to Xia Tian Gezi's school.

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
I studied for a while.

12
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,720
Xia Tian Gezi?

13
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,160
He's Dong Jin's uncle.

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,120
Is the shop doing well?

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Mr. Ba Shan.

16
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Not good.

17
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Very light.

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
You left.

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
It's hard to sell even flowers.

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
Mr. Wu asked me to bring this to you.

21
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
Thank you, uncle.

22
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,920
It seems that Mr. Wu's place

23
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,720
is not good.

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,160
The shop is closed at the moment.

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,400
We can consider

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
to move the shop.

27
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
Can the people agree?

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,600
The business is good at the top and bottom.

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,920
Of course they agree.

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
Do you open a high-end store?

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
No.

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,240
I open a furniture store.

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
I sell it for my friends.

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,440
What do you think?

35
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,240
It's convenient to sell.

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Mr. Wu.

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,320
You can buy it now.

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Yes.

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Here it is.

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
What are you doing?

41
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Go, go, go.

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
It's all private.

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Don't look.

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Zao.

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
I think you're a little bit of a criminal.

46
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
It's not enough to move the shop for more than a month.

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
What's wrong?

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
By the way,

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
I tell you.

50
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Don't tell Liang Xiang about this.

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
What?

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Are you afraid of her?

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
I'm afraid of her.

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm afraid of her.

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
I'm afraid of her.

56
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
I'm afraid of her.

57
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm afraid of her.

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
I'm afraid of her.

59
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I'm afraid of her.

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Are you afraid of her?

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,720
I'm not afraid of anyone.

62
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm afraid of her like you.

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
And I'm a little bit of a criminal.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I didn't see it.

65
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
You're a little bit of a criminal.

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Have you heard of this?

67
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
When?

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
I was walking on this road.

69
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,720
I was walking on the desert.

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Where is the place where I was at?

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
When?

72
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I was buried by the hand of the stranger.

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
A place where I was lost.

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,720
What's wrong with me?

75
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
I was walking on this road.

76
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
I was walking.

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I was walking to the place where I was going.

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
You're going?

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
You...

80
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Where are you going, Cai Chi?

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Where are you going?

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm going with Qian Li Xing.

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Tonight, we're going to do a public service.

84
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
The entrance is called Kalei Lai Su.

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Public service?

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm just asking you.

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
There's no such thing as a secret in the cafeteria.

88
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
There's always a hot pot with potatoes.

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Cai Chi, tonight, you're going to work.

90
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Go upstairs now.

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
You're going to sleep again?

92
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Don't worry.

93
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Are you still having a relationship with that...

94
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Chao Xian's daughter, Lala Chuan Chuan?

95
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Are you going to be a little bit annoying?

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Don't be annoying.

97
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
I really can't take the time.

98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Many of the exams are waiting for me.

99
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
How can I have time to teach you?

100
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
I don't understand.

101
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Just you guys.

102
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
What kind of military school are you going to do?

103
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
It's not me.

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
It's Sun Wen who took me.

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
He's going to do the military school in Qingshan.

106
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
He's going to do the military school in Qingshan.

107
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
We're talking about the peace.

108
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
You can't take out some sincerity.

109
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
You can do it.

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
How's Liang Xiang doing?

111
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,720
You're going to be the one to hold him back.

112
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
He's a good guy.

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
I have a sense of duty.

114
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
He's a talented guy.

115
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
You don't have to say that.

116
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Tell me,

117
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Yuan Shi Kai left a mark for him.

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
He's always there.

119
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Yuan Shi Kai is also in the mood.

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
He's not cold.

121
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Liang Xiang isn't cold.

122
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
He's always there.

123
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
When we left Shanghai,

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Prince Chun and Prince Zai talked to him personally.

125
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
When he arrived in Japan,

126
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Prince Qin sent his son to war.

127
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
He came to Japan to deliver money.

128
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
In Japan,

129
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Prince Lin personally made his guardian.

130
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
He chose to be a guest.

131
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
He also introduced a bunch of Japanese people to him.

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
To be honest,

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
he's just a real leader

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
who's making a well-known country for the Qing Dynasty.

135
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
I think Liang Xiang's mood

136
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
is not about me being the one to hold him back.

137
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
He's the one to hold me back.

138
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
He's the one to hold you back?

139
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Not just me.

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
The Chinese classmates who are in the same class

141
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
who are the ones to hold him back

142
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
he's the one to deliver the money.

143
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
The new batch of Japanese students

144
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
are the happier,

145
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
the more filial,

146
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
the more filial,

147
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
the more filial.

148
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Which Liang Xiang isn't in the mood for?

149
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Han Hua,

150
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I think

151
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,320
it's not that your revolution is

152
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,720
to delay Liang Xiang,

153
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
but that Liang Xiang

154
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,720
is the elite of Yan Lan Revolution.

155
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
So it seems

156
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
I really underestimated this doll.

157
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Of course.

158
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Think about it.

159
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
A royal priest

160
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
can see the changes.

161
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
The royal priest's face

162
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
can still find the second one.

163
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
If that's the case,

164
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
why is it so?

165
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
If he wants to delay you,

166
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
you can follow him.

167
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Wherever he goes,

168
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
you can go.

169
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
You don't need a relative

170
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
to help him.

171
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
I always want

172
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,720
to put this into the internal world.

173
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
To take over the future

174
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
and take over Beijing's

175
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
power and fortune.

176
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Don't be so selfish, brother.

177
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I'll try.

178
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
You can't do it.

179
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
You have to do your best.

180
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Don't do

181
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
those crazy bloodshed anymore.

182
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Liang Xiang.

183
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
This is the library.

184
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Don't worry.

185
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
The British Army.

186
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
The Beijing War.

187
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
That's the case.

188
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
As the descendant of the Eighth Qi Army,

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
I want to know

190
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
why the hundred-armed

191
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
and hundred-armed

192
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
army of the Eighth Qi Army

193
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
was completely destroyed

194
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
after the Battle of the Paris Bridge.

195
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Not bad.

196
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
It was painful.

197
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
It was painful.

198
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
I was able to

199
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
find the original

200
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
and the historical evidence.

201
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
It was very painful.

202
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Many of my relatives

203
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
were in the Qi army of the Three Gorges.

204
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
The tens of thousands of Qi soldiers

205
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
were shot by the British Army

206
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
and were killed by the Khangri Fire Department.

207
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
The tens of thousands of Qi soldiers

208
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
were left without a trace.

209
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
It is said that

210
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
the Empress Dowager

211
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
knew that many of the Huangqing people

212
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
were very active

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
and didn't want to fight them.

214
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
But it was a special position.

215
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
It's just a disarmament.

216
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
It's nothing.

217
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
It's nothing.

218
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
It's not the most painful.

219
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
It's not.

220
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
In China,

221
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
the most painful moment

222
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
is not yet.

223
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Only the most painful moment

224
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
is when the tyrant

225
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
is in pain.

226
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
The three-legged hat,

227
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
the yellow tail,

228
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
the straight tail,

229
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
the vertical tail.

230
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
The pen is made of a giant.

231
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
It's made of a horse tail.

232
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Look at it.

233
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
The sister is here.

234
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
She's on the road.

235
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
She's on the road.

236
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Do you still want some ink?

237
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
If you want to buy it,

238
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
you can buy this kind of top.

239
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
It's very ink.

240
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
It's very ink-like.

241
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
The fabric is very ink.

242
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
The ink is a bit stronger.

243
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
But it's firm,

244
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
it's very thick,

245
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
it's not sticky,

246
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
and it's easy to eat.

247
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
It's no better to use it

248
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
to write a letter.

249
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
It's a girl from Nan-Geng.

250
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Tian Bai.

251
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
You're here.

252
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I'll get some coffee.

253
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
I'll be there myself.

254
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
That's great.

255
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
It smells good.

256
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Compared to the big one,

257
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
it's really the underground one.

258
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
I heard that

259
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
the two bombs that Guangzhou city

260
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
just thought of

261
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
were produced by your house.

262
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
How's the deal with the peace?

263
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Don't mention it.

264
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
It's not that easy.

265
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
We have to make a mess here.

266
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I can't find a fox.

267
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
How can I say?

268
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
The theory is too big

269
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
to be divided.

270
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
The two parties always think

271
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
that if we don't push the Qing Dynasty,

272
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
we can't save China.

273
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
As for the future,

274
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
what kind of country

275
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
we want to build,

276
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
what kind of situation,

277
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
we want to make a mess,

278
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
we want to make a mess,

279
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
we want to make a mess.

280
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
What kind of construction are we talking about now?

281
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Jiangshan is still in his hands.

282
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
We can only talk about destruction.

283
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Talking about construction now,

284
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
the problem of the division

285
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
is not easy to be solved.

286
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Tao Chengzhang,

287
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
you're also the point.

288
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
But personally,

289
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
the Sun Wen of the heart

290
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
is far from us.

291
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Their theoretical goal

292
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
is also very clear.

293
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
When will you

294
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
stand on the side of Sun Wen?

295
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Our hometown has an old saying.

296
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
A small summer

297
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
needs to know how to get into the dark.

298
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
It's easy to break the broken one.

299
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
But after breaking the broken one,

300
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
where are we going?

301
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
You can't just know

302
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
how to get into the dark

303
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
without knowing how to get into the dark.

304
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
The three main points of Sun Wen

305
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
are very clear.

306
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
The average land power

307
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
is built together.

308
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Their direction

309
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
is also very clear.

310
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Yes.

311
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
We still have to talk about it.

312
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
When the theoretical goal is clear,

313
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
we can talk about

314
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
the alliance.

315
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
By the way,

316
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
what is Shuhong doing?

317
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
He won't really come

318
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
to be Xiaoman, right?

319
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Now he's in his heart

320
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
and is in his shop.

321
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
He's been through a lot.

322
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Let me tell you something.

323
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Let him help you get a job.

324
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
What?

325
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Let him help me get a job?

326
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
It's a good fit for him to hide his identity.

327
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Of course,

328
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
it's also a bad thing

329
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
to be so helpless.

330
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
What?

331
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
What?

332
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Let me make you a fire?

333
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Let me go to the kitchen?

334
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Don't take him as a robber.

335
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Just take him as

336
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
a celery.

337
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Cucumber.

338
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
You're just a cook.

339
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
You're not like him.

340
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Can you do the same?

341
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Can you kill him?

342
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
What do you mean?

343
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Can you kill him?

344
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
As long as you're sincere,

345
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
you can kill him.

346
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Let me ask you something.

347
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Have you ever been a buyer?

348
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Then why are you sitting there?

349
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Why are you looking at me?

350
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
It's because you're capable.

351
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Don't talk to me.

352
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Who paid you?

353
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
We've got a lot of money

354
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
in overseas.

355
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
It's really worth it?

356
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Money is not a problem.

357
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
So why didn't you do it?

358
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,720
It's really serious.

359
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Japan needs China.

360
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
So it's a big deal.

361
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
The people in the revolution

362
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
have been doing

363
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
the same thing

364
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
as they did in Japan.

365
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Now they're all dead.

366
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
They're all dead.

367
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
They're all dead.

368
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Now they're here to find you.

369
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
And it's more convenient

370
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
to do things for women.

371
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Okay, I'll try it.

372
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
I'll try it.

373
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Okay, I'll try it.

374
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Let them save the money

375
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
and save it in the shop.

376
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Don't make a fuss about it.

377
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
If you do anything,

378
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
you'll be lucky.

379
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
But you...

380
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
You promised me.

381
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Didn't you tell me to promise you?

382
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
It's too easy.

383
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
You'll believe me if I do this.

384
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Look.

385
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Can I not believe you two?

386
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
You're my brother-in-law.

387
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Am I wrong?

388
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
You're my brother-in-law.

389
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
So you're childish.

390
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Listen to me.

391
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Tell me.

392
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Listen to me.

393
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Even if you promise me,

394
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
you have to talk to them.

395
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
First,

396
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
you can't keep your money.

397
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
The debt between the people

398
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
is in the hands of the people.

399
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,720
It's not that everyone is good.

400
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Everyone is not greedy.

401
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Some people are rich because of revolution.

402
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
You don't have to keep your money.

403
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Connect the goods and goods.

404
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Make a good deal.

405
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Let them pay for the debt.

406
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Second,

407
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
you have to find a internal shop.

408
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
The more you guard the East Jingkong,

409
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
the more people will give you a steel pipe.

410
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
You'll be a gun.

411
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Then you're stupid.

412
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
You have to find an internal shop to help you.

413
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
So,

414
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
what kind of gun and price,

415
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
you have to pay.

416
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
You're an internal shop.

417
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
I'm just kidding.

418
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
You're done.

419
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
How can I?

420
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
I'm the leader of revolution.

421
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
I'll treat you as a slave.

422
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
What are you talking about?

423
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
What kind of leader

424
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
have you been doing these two days?

425
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
What kind of leader?

426
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
I'm asking you.

427
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
You don't understand

428
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
the beauty of the world.

429
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
I'm not a person who can sing in vain.

430
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
I'm a spirit.

431
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
The most important thing in China now

432
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
is the spirit of revolution.

433
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
You're a spirit.

434
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
You let me be the manager.

435
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I have one condition.

436
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Otherwise, I can't do it.

437
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Uncle.

438
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
You have to be my partner.

439
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Why did you call me

440
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Mr. Ayakona?

441
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I don't know.

442
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
I'm sorry.

443
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm sorry.

444
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Mr. Ryokyoko.

445
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
What happened to you

446
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
from the accident?

447
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
I don't know.

448
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Oh?

449
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
You're a pretty dog.

450
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
What's your name?

451
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
It's a onion.

452
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
It's interesting.

453
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
The ordinary onions

454
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
grow bigger in the trees.

455
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Do you see

456
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
your onion running

457
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
on both legs?

458
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
If you don't understand a dog,

459
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
you can't talk to him.

460
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm also a child.

461
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
I was a dog.

462
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
My name is Futoucho.

463
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
But three years later,

464
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,720
I got a bone and a skin disease.

465
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Yesterday, I had a stroke.

466
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Oh, it's a disease.

467
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
A disease that I have.

468
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Is that so?

469
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
This dog is very, very small.

470
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
What's your name?

471
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Why are you talking to me?

472
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Are you talking to me?

473
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Why can't I hear you?

474
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Where did I stand?

475
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,720
I'm not your master or master.

476
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I'm sorry.

477
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,720
But I have a condition.

478
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Are you seriously injured?

479
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
What's wrong?

480
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
You were so careless.

481
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I can't be a slave.

482
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
I have to be a father.

483
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
I have to be a father.

484
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
I have to be a father.

485
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I want my master to talk to you.

486
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Yes.

487
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I'm sorry.

488
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I'm sorry.

489
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
I'm sorry.

490
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
You were here today.

491
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Yes, I was here earlier.

492
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
This way.

493
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
You can see it.

494
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
It's a private school.

495
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Last night,

496
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,720
the Japanese armed forces

497
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,720
were fighting against the Russian

498
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,720
who were fighting against the Japanese

499
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
who were fighting against the Japanese

500
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,720
who were fighting against the Japanese.

501
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,720
So, the Japanese and Russian troops

502
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
were fighting against the Japanese

503
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,720
who were fighting against the Japanese.

504
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
That's right.

505
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
I'll ask you a question.

506
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
What's your opinion?

507
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Please tell me.

508
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Yan-chan,

509
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,720
you are the one who is now in the Japanese army.

510
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,720
You are the one who is fighting

511
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
against the Japanese.

512
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,720
What do you think about the incident

513
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
that happened yesterday?

514
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
What's wrong?

515
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
What happened?

516
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
I didn't realize that

517
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,720
all the Japanese students were in class today.

518
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Even if we were in class in China.

519
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Why?

520
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I heard that

521
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
the Japanese students were still in class.

522
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
That's strange.

523
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Why are they in class?

524
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Well,

525
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
let's start today's lecture.

526
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Today, we will talk about the night battle

527
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
between the Japanese army,

528
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
the Chinese army,

529
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
and the Japanese army.

530
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Let's talk about the defense.

531
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
When the time comes,

532
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
if you have any questions,

533
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,720
let's talk about it with everyone.

534
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Sir,

535
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I don't know

536
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
why the Japanese students

537
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,720
are in class.

538
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
If you answer the question

539
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
in the two words,

540
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
it's a battle.

541
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
I don't know what to say.

542
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
I don't know what to say.

543
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,720
They are trained to fight

544
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,720
and to fight.

545
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
They need their strength

546
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,720
in the war.

547
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
The war is over.

548
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,720
We will continue

549
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
to fight.

550
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
We will continue to fight

551
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
and to fight.

552
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
The Japanese army

553
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
is the most basic

554
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,720
and basic

555
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,720
strategy unit.

556
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Where are you going?

557
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Something big is happening.

558
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Brother Tu Fang,

559
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
the Japanese army's third army is about to start.

560
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
The front line is full of fools.

561
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Did you hear anything?

562
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I heard it.

563
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
The newspaper is on the table.

564
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Take a look.

565
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
What is this?

566
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Two officers

567
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
fought in your house.

568
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
They destroyed your house.

569
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
They are the ones who are the losers.

570
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
We are all the losers.

571
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Brother Tu Fang, are you kidding?

572
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
What are you looking at?

573
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
What are you looking at?

574
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
I am not.

575
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
I am not.

576
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
I am not.

577
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
I am not.

578
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
I am not.

579
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I am not.

580
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
I am not.

581
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
I am not.

582
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
I am not.

583
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I am not.

584
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
I am not.

585
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
I am not.

586
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Isn't that the one who fell down

587
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
and got his mouth full?

588
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
It is useless.

589
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
It is useless.

590
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Don't be so loud.

591
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
What is it?

592
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
You are making me angry.

593
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
I think you are a man.

594
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
A man with a gun.

595
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
A man who loves the country.

596
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
That's right.

597
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
That's right.

598
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
It is not a joke.

599
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
What are we doing here?

600
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
We are here to learn military history.

601
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Think about it.

602
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
If we fight over there,

603
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
wouldn't we be able to learn it?

604
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Those who don't want to teach us

605
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
the top books,

606
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
they have to be published.

607
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
This time, the sea of the East and the sea of the Pimbalang

608
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
and the Jiao Wu

609
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
are the same as the moves

610
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
of the Beiyang Water City.

611
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
They are completely the same.

612
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
The war has begun.

613
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
It is about to expand.

614
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
Let's see how the Japanese

615
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
move the enemy.

616
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,720
They have to take out all kinds of new weapons and new tactics.

617
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
He is not like us.

618
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
It is not so easy to fight the Japanese.

619
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
If it is not easy,

620
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
he will make all the moves.

621
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
We are looking at the outside world.

622
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
We are looking at the inside world.

623
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,720
We are learning the outside world.

624
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Right.

625
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Am I right, Tu?

626
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Mother.

627
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,720
You are the only one who can support the Japanese.

628
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,720
The signal of the Japanese is a little bit old.

629
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
It is a little bit old.

630
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
The Japanese have been

631
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
changing their way of life.

632
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
But the way they are doing it is good.

633
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Every time they are returning the oil,

634
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
they use the oil to

635
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
keep it safe.

636
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
But I have to touch the things

637
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
that I can't touch.

638
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
You are right.

639
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
After I teach you,

640
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
I can't touch them.

641
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
I am better than you

642
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
in the country.

643
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
You are better than the enemy.

644
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Don't mess with me.

645
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
The weapons used in the North-East War

646
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
are the gun of the Mali people,

647
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,720
the gun of the Ma gun, the gun of the hand gun, and the gun of the Karus.

648
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
You are a little bit old.

649
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
You can't do anything.

650
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
You are still so young.

651
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
You don't have the golden bullet.

652
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Can you defeat the golden wind?

653
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,720
I can explain it.

654
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
I can explain it.

655
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
What are you doing?

656
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Why are you angry?

657
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

658
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
What do you mean?

659
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
I know a weapon.

660
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Who are you scolding?

661
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
The government has expressed its anger.

662
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Do you know what it is?

663
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
It is a serious attack.

664
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Isn't it a bullet?

665
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
It is a revenge.

666
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
It is a good revenge.

667
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
You can fool your strength.

668
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
I saw those Japanese soldiers

669
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
who are going to war

670
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
are all dead.

671
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
I hate them.

672
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
What do you hate?

673
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
We have 40,000 people in China.

674
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Don't give me lessons.

675
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Just tell me.

676
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Did you cut the price?

677
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
I am giving up.

678
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
How much can he give?

679
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
He wants to give me five.

680
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
Five is not enough.

681
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
At least ten.

682
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
My mother.

683
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
She knows what the police is doing.

684
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
She wants to fight.

685
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
She is the money of the gun.

686
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
It is not bad.

687
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Who are you scolding?

688
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I...

689
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
It is a war.

690
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
The police is going to attack.

691
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
The weapons are going to be seen.

692
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
It is more than a gun.

693
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
It is more than a gun.

694
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
It is more than a gun.

695
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
When he is dead,

696
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
we will have more than 30,000 people.

697
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
We will have more.

698
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
If you don't believe me,

699
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
we will be shot.

700
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
I will cut it.

701
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
I will cut it.

702
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
What are you looking at?

703
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
You are shocked.

704
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
I will kill you.

705
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
We won't price the dictatorship.

706
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,700
We will take the decisions,

707
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
give up.

708
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,640
Then the people should

709
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
change their mode of living.

710
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,720
Don't plan to wallet,

711
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
change our clothes.

712
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Go away.

713
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,760
You...

714
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,320
Go...

715
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
we have no one like you.

716
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
We must have a goal.

717
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,320
We must have a simple and clear goal.

718
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,920
It's too important.

719
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,120
The one who knows the truth will be the one who knows the danger.

720
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,520
Today, China is winnable,

721
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,720
and can be defeated.

722
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,520
It's strong, and it's weak, and it can be divided, and it can be combined.

723
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,120
We have already taken the path of ten words.

724
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,720
Where are we going?

725
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,320
Where will our country go?

726
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,920
It's still that goal.

727
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,320
That fighting goal.

728
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Do you have it?

729
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,120
Yes!

730
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,320
What is your goal?

731
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,520
I know you, young man.

732
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,320
I know you are using the court to change the content.

733
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Some people are concerned about the idea of the empire,

734
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,120
and I agree with the idea of China's long-term enemy.

735
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,920
The reason is very sufficient,

736
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,920
but it also brings us a problem that we can't solve.

737
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,920
Before we get the national flag,

738
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,920
how are we going to fight against the foreign forces?

739
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,320
Is it because we are here to talk nonsense?

740
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,120
That's why I gave you the goal of

741
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,320
using the court to use the court to

742
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,520
bury the current Qing Dynasty!

743
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
To make the court happy!

744
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,120
Good!

745
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,520
Court!

746
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,320
Court!

747
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,920
Court!

748
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Court!

749
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,720
Court!

750
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Court!

751
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,120
Court!

752
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
Begin again!

753
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Court!

754
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Let's go!

755
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Begin!

756
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
Oh, I can't run!

757
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
I'll pull you out!

758
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Then, I can't run!

759
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
I'm more likely to be in trouble.

760
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
The police will come soon.

761
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
The police are scary.

762
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,120
I'm not scared!

763
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,120
I don't want to be found by the police.

764
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Are you scared?

765
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Don't be.

766
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,120
I just don't want to.

767
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Wait!

768
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,120
I really can't run!

769
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
But...

770
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
But I...

771
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,120
I'll give you my permission.

772
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,120
Since when?

773
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
You've never told me

774
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
that you're a child?

775
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Yesterday...

776
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
I decided that.

777
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
You decided?

778
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Yes.

779
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
I'm sorry.

780
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
I'm sorry.

781
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
I'm sorry.

782
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
I'm sorry.

783
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
Tell me.

784
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Who did that?

785
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Who did it?

786
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,320
The Japanese security police.

787
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
What's wrong?

788
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Are you scared?

789
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,520
Are you scared?

790
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Do you think I have a choice?

791
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Amanji, are you scared?

792
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
I don't have a choice.

793
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
That's why I came to see you.

794
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Take me away.

795
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
Run away from this end.

796
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
Run away from this end.

797
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Let's not be.

798
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Let's think.

799
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
What are you thinking about?

800
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I don't have time.

801
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,520
I'll go to the field.

802
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
I'll go to China with you.

803
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
But...

804
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,520
If you run away from me,

805
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
you'll never come back.

806
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
This is the end.

807
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Let's think.

808
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,520
I don't want to say anything else.

809
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,520
I have a plan to talk to you in Tokyo.

810
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,520
If I take you away from here...

811
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,520
The plan and love are the same.

812
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,520
The plan is always in the same way.

813
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Please.

814
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
Please.

815
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
No.

816
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
It's true.

817
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Don't look at me like that.

818
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
I need your help.

819
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,520
So,

820
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I'll take you to the field.

821
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
So, now...

822
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
I understand.

823
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
After all...

824
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,720
After all, I don't know about myself.

825
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
I don't.

826
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
It's too late.

827
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Can you see that?

828
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
I let go of the machine.

829
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
While you were playing around,

830
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
they came looking for you.

831
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Why do we have to be like this every day

832
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,720
to look after women?

833
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm really tired.

834
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
I have no choice.

835
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
I'm not going to be like this.

836
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
I'm going to be the father.

837
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
How's it going?

838
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Thank you.

839
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Are you going to be with me?

840
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Thank you.

841
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Thank you.

842
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Thank you.

843
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,120
What should we go?

844
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,120
I see.

845
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Hello, boss.

846
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
You...

847
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,120
You're not here to buy flowers, are you?

848
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,120
I'm not buying anything.

849
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Then you...

850
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,120
I've been driving by your shop.

851
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,120
So...

852
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,120
Can I treat you to a meal?

853
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
You treat me?

854
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,120
A meal? I've just had one.

855
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Okay.

856
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Then...

857
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Then...

858
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,120
Okay.

859
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,120
Why don't you wait outside?

860
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,120
You can look after me.

861
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,120
Okay.
