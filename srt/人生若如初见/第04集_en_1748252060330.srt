00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The End

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Doctor Yu Tianbai.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mrs. Yu is here.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Please.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Welcome to Doctor Yu.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mrs. Yu.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Mrs. Yu.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mr. Moliang from the National Guards.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mrs. Lu is here.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Please.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's wrong?

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're still in the hairpin.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's okay.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yihua.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Mrs. Lu is here to say hello to you.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't be afraid.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't talk to anyone.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who can make you care so much?

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Who else can it be?

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Your three-wife from the National Guards.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Three-wife?

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What's the matter?

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's just that doctor's wife.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Doctor's wife?

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Three-wife?

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't think about it, master.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're so ugly.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Please find me.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Did you find the owner of the night, Prince Chun?

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know him.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A 17-year-old girl.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is there anyone in the main force?

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The main force is Yang Yuan.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yang Yuan?

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yang Yuan?

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yang Yuan?

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yang Yuan?

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's so young.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hello.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm here to see a stranger.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That fat guy.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He's looking at me.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He's Jiang Su Qun Fu.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I used to get hurt.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did he come here?

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How about this?

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You'll get the car back soon.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No matter what happens,

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I won't leave the car.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What about you?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't worry.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You go first.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come here.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Lord Xun Fu, how are you?

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who's that beauty?

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
My wife.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then you call her.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let me see her.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
She's holding her hand on the carriage.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, right.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where's the Prince?

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Prince?

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How could he come here?

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Many people in Shanghai want to send Prince to me.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He's sending the treasure to me.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is that the face?

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on, brother.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're on the road?

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You and your wife will take a walk.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll give you a good point.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Brother, what's in your hand?

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This thing is supposed to be given to the Prince first.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But since the Prince didn't come,

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you're drunk.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're the one who left it to you.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Brother, you...

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're drunk.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're drunk.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're drunk.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're drunk.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Brother.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Brother.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Get out.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,460
?!

133
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,340
Yes.

134
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,940
My lord,

135
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,200
catch him!

136
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Hurry up and go.

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,280
He is trying to steal money!

138
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,780
Hey!

139
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,080
Hey!

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,380
This...

141
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Look at me, Susa!

142
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,780
It's the wife of the mother-in-law of the house!

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:45,980
This...

144
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,780
It's a big trouble!

145
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,580
Where are we going?

146
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,080
Where are we going?

147
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
Say something!

148
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
I told you.

149
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
We are fate.

150
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,580
We can't separate if we want to.

151
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
No! I'm not with you anymore.

152
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
I don't want to be with you!

153
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Are you afraid?

154
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,580
Is Zhu Jiuzu's crime the right thing to do?

155
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,580
It's too late now.

156
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,580
Let's go to Japan together and leave for the high-class.

157
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,580
We are tied together.

158
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,580
We are all the leading characters in the news.

159
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,580
So you have no choice but to follow me.

160
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
One more time.

161
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Don't be afraid.

162
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,580
Susa!

163
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,580
Let's go.

164
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
Stand by!

165
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,580
I knew you wouldn't leave.

166
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,580
A'Wa!

167
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,580
Don't say anything.

168
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,580
I'll keep your word about the dirty business.

169
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
But you have to promise me.

170
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
Be good.

171
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,580
I won't.

172
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,580
Take care of yourself.

173
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,580
If you face any difficulties,

174
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
write me a letter.

175
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Open the door!

176
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Open the door!

177
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
Hurry up!

178
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580
Open the door!

179
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
Open the door!

180
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
Don't sit on that table.

181
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
Did you hear that?

182
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
Who are you talking to?

183
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
I'm talking to you.

184
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
Yang Yang.

185
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
This table is mine.

186
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
Your table is upstairs.

187
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Why do you let me sleep?

188
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
I have to sleep.

189
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,580
You're a good man.

190
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,580
You like to climb high.

191
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,580
You're the one who deserve our lives.

192
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
Did I say something wrong?

193
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Kaizhi.

194
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
I've been with you for a long time.

195
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
Can you be more polite?

196
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
We're all from the same country.

197
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,580
No need to be so polite.

198
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
Don't think you know my secret.

199
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
I'll kill you.

200
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Let me tell you.

201
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
I've experienced death.

202
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,580
I'm not afraid of anything.

203
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,580
How many pieces of paper are there?

204
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,580
I don't have any.

205
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
You're Kaizhi's brother.

206
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,580
He has a lot of money.

207
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
He needs a treasure.

208
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
Here.

209
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
Kaizhi.

210
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
I'll be your treasure.

211
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,580
We're from the same country.

212
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,580
We're all from the same country.

213
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
We're all from the same country.

214
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
We're all from the same country.

215
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Let's go to the restaurant.

216
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
Japanese people are good.

217
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
The food is full.

218
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
You haven't answered me.

219
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
What did you answer?

220
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,580
Why did you do that?

221
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
Why did you do that?

222
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580
You're killing people, aren't you?

223
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
If your bomb is really exploded,

224
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,580
how many people will be hurt?

225
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,580
How could you be so scared?

226
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
You're a female teacher of Shouye's family.

227
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,580
Yes.

228
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,580
I'm a teacher, a writer,

229
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
a modernist.

230
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,580
I'm not killing people.

231
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
I'm doing my best.

232
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Doing your best?

233
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,580
What's your best?

234
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
The best.

235
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,580
The best.

236
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
The best.

237
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,580
The best.

238
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,580
The best.

239
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
The best.

240
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
The country needs a king.

241
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,580
The people are blind.

242
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,580
There must be someone

243
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
who can change this.

244
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,580
Remember this.

245
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
Even if you lose,

246
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,580
this is fate.

247
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
You and I are just friends.

248
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
We can't attack each other.

249
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
The country needs a king.

250
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
The country needs a king.

251
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,580
The country needs a king.

252
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
The country needs a king.

253
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,580
The country needs a king.

254
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,580
The country needs a king.

255
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,580
The country needs a king.

256
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
The country needs a king.

257
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,580
The country needs a king.

258
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
The country needs a king.

259
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
The country needs a king.

260
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
The country needs a king.

261
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
The country needs a king.

262
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
The country needs a king.

263
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,580
The country needs a king.

264
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
The country needs a king.

265
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,360
Team Heng ligability

266
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,900
Come sit there

267
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:14,860
Boxvillage

268
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,540
Good morning

269
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,420
W-w Dang

270
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,080
Dai

271
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,800
Hurry

272
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,960
customer, come here

273
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,940
you wanna have some?

274
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,420
no need

275
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,260
I just want a little wine

276
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,220
honey

277
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,320
Um... I want to borrow this.

278
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,300
...This, this, and this.

279
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,020
Sure.

280
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,340
Should I chop these?

281
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,420
Huh?

282
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,520
Have you finished?

283
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,780
You've finished them all?

284
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,340
No!

285
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,580
Yes.��

286
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,460
This is Shoushou City District

287
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,140
Poisoned in Hubei

288
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,960
Chinese people

289
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,980
He's a little better. He's still very weak.

290
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,580
His mom is Chinese.

291
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,980
This guy is Japanese.

292
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,580
He's a local Japanese.

293
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,340
Miss, I'll order a kitchen

294
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,580
and make a bowl of rice soup.

295
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,780
I'll be waiting.

296
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Hello.

297
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,780
Please give me a side dish.

298
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,180
I'll get you one.

299
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,780
I understand, sir.

300
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Here.

301
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,380
It's okay.

302
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,780
I've already eaten it.

303
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,180
Look at you. You're really going to the toilet.

304
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,380
Then we have to pretend to be a little bit like that.

305
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,780
Don't say that. The toilet is really clean.

306
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,980
If you spray perfume, you won't say it.

307
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
The floor is like a mirror.

308
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,180
You just spit it out and it still sings.

309
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,380
Guess what?

310
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,180
What?

311
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,980
From this point on, I'll play with another one.

312
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,980
Don't believe me.

313
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,380
I'm lying to you, Pengpeng.

314
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,980
Thank you.

315
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,180
I've already made it. It'll be ready soon.

316
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,780
He knows how to speak Chinese.

317
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,380
So what are you going to keep?

318
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,780
That day, on the road to Shanghai,

319
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,780
I saw an old lady in front of me.

320
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,380
She was very fat.

321
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,780
I told Ma Zhan in the back.

322
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,180
I didn't know that either.

323
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,780
I told Ma Zhan in the back.

324
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,180
I didn't know what to eat.

325
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,780
I ate so much.

326
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,380
Who knows that old lady in white?

327
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,980
She replied,

328
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,380
Where did you go to go back to Shanghai?

329
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,580
Ji Bei.

330
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,980
And,

331
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,180
Our five guards

332
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,580
In the camp in the small town,

333
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,980
Mr. Yuan found us a few German soldiers.

334
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,580
They all kept the alive ones.

335
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,980
That's how it is.

336
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,580
Then they will speak Chinese.

337
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,980
The commandment said it was very good.

338
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,580
Mr. Yuan said to Mr. De,

339
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,980
My soldier is good.

340
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,780
Just when the gun was firing,

341
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,980
I never marked it.

342
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,180
It was like this.

343
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,780
Mr. Yuan said,

344
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,180
You have to teach them to mark it.

345
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,180
On German.

346
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,780
On German.

347
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,980
Those German soldiers

348
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,780
Only know that.

349
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,980
No matter what Mr. Yuan said to them,

350
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,980
They all put the gun down.

351
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,180
On German.

352
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,980
The food you want.

353
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,580
What are you looking for?

354
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,780
Eat. Don't look at it.

355
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,380
Our food is like

356
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,780
The most delicious food in the kitchen.

357
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,380
Right?

358
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,580
Are you from the noble family?

359
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,980
Is it really this?

360
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,580
My mother is very old.

361
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,780
There is a set of tricks at home.

362
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,980
Only when the noble guests come can they use it.

363
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,180
This soup has to be used to make soup.

364
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,780
After drinking tea, you have to use your hands.

365
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,980
You can't just eat and drink.

366
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,180
Did you hear that?

367
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,780
The noble family is the most important thing.

368
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,980
You have to pass three generations of training.

369
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,780
By the way,

370
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,980
How much is your mother's ancestors'

371
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,180
Royal Father's son-in-law Wang Du?

372
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,780
The ancestors are so dedicated to him.

373
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,980
The first-class sleeper,

374
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,580
Your Yang Kai Zhi is also a book-reader.

375
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,180
The only person who is in charge of the reading is Fang Yang.

376
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,980
Who told you that I am a book-reader?

377
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,580
You have read the book of self-reliance in Wuchang.

378
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,580
That's right.

379
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,180
You told her that I am a book-reader.

380
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,580
You have read the book of self-reliance in Wuchang?

381
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,580
Shanghai is so busy.

382
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,980
Our group of people

383
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,780
Have been wandering around for a long time.

384
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,980
Who has done anything?

385
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,980
They are all very busy.

386
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
This is a funeral.

387
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,980
It's a funeral.

388
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
It's a very open place.

389
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,980
By the way, do you have a bread?

390
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,980
The one that smells like the new building?

391
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Hello.

392
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,980
Hello.

393
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
Do you need help?

394
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,980
Is the bread in your hand brought back?

395
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,980
Yes.

396
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,980
It's fresh and hot.

397
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Really?

398
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
It smells like the new building.

399
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
Do you want it?

400
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
If you want it, you can take it.

401
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,980
I'll go to the restaurant.

402
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Yes.

403
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
I'll go to the restaurant.

404
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Really?

405
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,980
Thank you so much.

406
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
The old man,

407
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
You can send it to the warehouse.

408
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,980
That one, 206.

409
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
No need to thank.

410
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,980
It's a hand-picked one.

411
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,980
206, right?

412
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Do you like it?

413
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Yes.

414
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
I think your appetite is very good.

415
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
I'll go to the restaurant.

416
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,980
I'll go to the restaurant.

417
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Thank you.

418
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,980
I'll go to the restaurant.

419
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Thank you.

420
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,980
I'll go to the restaurant.

421
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Thank you.

422
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Thank you.

423
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Thank you.

424
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
Thank you.

425
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Thank you.

426
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Thank you.

427
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,980
Thank you.

428
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,980
Thank you.

429
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
Excuse me.

430
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,980
Can I have your clothes?

431
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,980
You asked me?

432
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,980
Is there another person?

433
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,980
I'll ask you.

434
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,980
I'll ask the management of the boat.

435
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
First, there is a laundry room on the boat.

436
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,980
You can take the laundry without any cost.

437
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
It's all a medical thing.

438
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,980
Why do you wash it for strangers?

439
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,980
It's also a matter of the same.

440
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
What about the second one?

441
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
If you are willing to wash it yourself,

442
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,980
the boat can dry it for you.

443
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Dry it?

444
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
How can it dry?

445
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
I don't know.

446
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
The boat has a machine.

447
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,980
The management said that

448
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
there is no clothes on the boat.

449
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,980
The boat is the rule.

450
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
I know.

451
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,980
There are so many rules in Japan.

452
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
You are military students?

453
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
Yes.

454
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
We are all military students.

455
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
The official is the one who stays in the military.

456
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,980
You wash your clothes at home?

457
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Yes.

458
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
I don't know how to wash it.

459
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,980
I think so.

460
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,980
You have to do this.

461
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
And then...

462
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,980
I'll wash it for you.

463
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Why are you embarrassed?

464
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
You are a little angry.

465
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,980
The boat is the one who drinks it.

466
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
I'm embarrassed.

467
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Who are you?

468
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Not a person.

469
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
A handkerchief.

470
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
I'll wash it for you.

471
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,980
Take a bath first.

472
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Then you can use the water.

473
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,980
Then you can use the soap.

474
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,980
I have a soap.

475
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,980
Thank you.

476
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,980
I think he is a little lazy.

477
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,980
I have to go back and have a look.

478
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,980
Okay.

479
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
It's too much trouble for you.

480
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,980
Who is going to go to Hong Kong?

481
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,980
I told you.

482
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,980
That military student.

483
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,980
Let him in.

484
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
No, no, no.

485
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Come in.

486
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,980
Sit down.

487
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,980
Hello.

488
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
I know your high-ranking master.

489
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,980
What?

490
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
The school president of the Japanese Army.

491
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,980
I really don't know.

492
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
This is good.

493
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
No matter how high the military class is,

494
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,980
you can go to his home to find him.

495
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Two years ago, we had a tea party.

496
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
He wants to teach us some online skills in China.

497
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
Give me the scissors.

498
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
I'll go to the small market.

499
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,980
I know why Japan is willing

500
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,980
to help us cultivate new military talents.

501
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Please give me your point.

502
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,980
Japan believes that Japan must cooperate with China.

503
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,980
In contrast,

504
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,980
it is more powerful than Russia and the West.

505
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Is that so?

506
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Of course.

507
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
You don't have to care about what the Japanese think.

508
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
While they are willing to teach,

509
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,980
they will catch the police.

510
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,980
The sound is also so good.

511
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
Is the voice good?

512
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
Xiang Yu.

513
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
Who is Xiang Yu?

514
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,980
Do you know Xiang Yu?

515
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
King of Chu Ba.

516
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,980
Look.

517
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
You are not as good as him.

518
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
I know King of Chu Ba.

519
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,980
Xiang Yu has only fought once in his life.

520
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Do you know who he lost to?

521
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
He lost to Han Xin.

522
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
Under that, Han Xin is more powerful than Xiang Yu.

523
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,980
But where did Han Xin's power come from?

524
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
Do you know?

525
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
What about you?

526
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
You can tell me.

527
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,980
What is the deal?

528
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
You can tell me.

529
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Don't be so stubborn.

530
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Don't talk nonsense.

531
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
You know it.

532
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Why should he learn from me?

533
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
He is as stupid as me.

534
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
He said you are very stupid.

535
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,980
How many of you are there?

536
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
When did I lie to you?

537
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
What did I lie to you?

538
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
I can't lie to you.

539
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,980
If you have to learn from the robbers,

540
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
you need to have a stubborn attitude.

541
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
Why did Han Xin leave?

542
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
Because Han Xin has done

543
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
Xiang Yu's direct attack.

544
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
That is, the security.

545
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
The whole battle of the record.

546
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
Xiang Yu ate, slept,

547
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
even got a big fight.

548
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
He was so stubborn.

549
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
He followed Han Xin.

550
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,980
Han Xin was trained by Xiang Yu.

551
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Do you understand?

552
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
I understand.

553
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,980
Han Xin's power

554
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,980
was learned from his enemy Xiang Yu.

555
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,980
Do you understand?

556
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,980
I understand.

557
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
I really understand that he is great.

558
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
Women are not like that.

559
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,980
Young man,

560
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
if you want to learn from him,

561
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,980
you need to have Han Xin's strength.

562
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,980
You need to use the enemy's practical experience

563
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
to improve yourself.

564
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
By the way,

565
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
what do you call him?

566
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,980
I haven't asked him yet.

567
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,980
My name is Liang Xiang.

568
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
You are Qi Yuan.

569
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
I am Qi Yuan.

570
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,980
If you are...

571
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,980
Liang Xiang,

572
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
I will leave.

573
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
Bye.

574
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,980
Why is he a stranger?

575
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
I am Qi Yuan.

576
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
I am Qi Yuan.

577
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
I am Qi Yuan.

578
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
I am Qi Yuan.

579
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,980
I am Qi Yuan.

580
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,980
I am Qi Yuan.

581
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
I am Qi Yuan.

582
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
I am Qi Yuan.

583
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,980
I am Qi Yuan.

584
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I am Qi Yuan.

585
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
I am Qi Yuan.

586
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
I am Qi Yuan.

587
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,980
I am Qi Yuan.

588
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
I am Qi Yuan.

589
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
I am Qi Yuan.

590
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
I am Qi Yuan.

591
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,980
Brother Qing Li.

592
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,980
Do you think

593
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
people usually care for

594
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
my position in the clan?

595
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
Who?

596
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Who cares?

597
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,980
You?

598
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Me?

599
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,980
You care about me, too.

600
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Am I right?

601
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Don't say that.

602
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,060
are different things,

603
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,660
and with another.

604
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,700
Those troubled times,

605
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,900
were you young or not?

606
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,020
To tell you the truth,

607
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,060
we five used to

608
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,660
Gunders and instruments

609
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,780
to fascinate people too much.

610
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,580
Are we?

611
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,700
Our country

612
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,860
was damaged

613
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,460
by this.

614
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,200
Besides the某氏

615
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,160
Important ?

616
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,040
Such a big king

617
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,400
but

618
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,020
What ?

619
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,060
Depends on the leader

620
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:23,640
A man does not tend to be a versus a woman- empres, so…

621
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,200
At least, you Opto 1s 있나?

622
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,660
I shame you, LS2.

623
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,480
The whole family is shocked by such a manly and heart Polish,

624
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,100
but I should avoid each child.

625
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,720
No worries, SS2.

626
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,640
I'll show you how a man is!

627
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,300
Since all the families are rich,

628
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,060
the Empress Dowager is not a big deal to be a big family.

629
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,780
What do you think?

630
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,440
I have nothing to say.

631
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,900
Why are you two here?

632
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,740
To thank you.

633
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,020
By the way, I just heard from the instructor

634
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,520
that we can't go directly to the school when we arrive in Japan.

635
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Is that so?

636
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,200
Where are we going then?

637
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,360
We have to go to school for hasally traeleayed students in Japan

638
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,760
to indigendize in the intel groups.

639
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,120
Then we could go into private courses.

640
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,340
To be honest,

641
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,080
we have沿 the safari.

642
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,960
I have always been super strength.

643
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,420
Follow suit,

644
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,720
I have served in the army forever,

645
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,220
always going through triggering troubles

646
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,400
and not a USA...!

647
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,720
And I have searched through your motherland.

648
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,240
Under that situation,

649
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,280
I think I didn't fear her, right?

650
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Don't say that.

651
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Liang Xiang, you have some kind of temperament in your blood vessels.

652
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,520
So you have a strong temperament.

653
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
I don't agree with you.

654
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,520
My mother said that if my student can go to Japan to study,

655
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
it will be cold and hot.

656
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
You two must know each other.

657
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
You two must know each other.

658
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
You two must know each other.

659
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
You two must know each other.

660
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
You two must know each other.

661
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
You two must know each other.

662
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
You two must know each other.

663
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
You two must know each other.

664
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
You two must know each other.

665
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
You two must know each other.

666
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
You two must know each other.

667
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
You two must know each other.

668
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
You two must know each other.

669
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
You two must know each other.

670
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
You two must know each other.

671
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,520
You two must know each other.

672
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
He's gone now?

673
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Is he gone already?

674
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
He's gone.

675
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,520
I had 6.15 am this morning.

676
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,520
I had 16 boats going on the boat,

677
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,520
then I went to Wusong in Guangji.

678
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Then I made a trip to Germany by the Bavarian號.

679
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,520
It was 12,000 tons of ship.

680
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
Then you made it clear.

681
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,000
President, thank you for your kindness.

682
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Otherwise...

683
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,000
What did the governor say?

684
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,560
He said it was an accident.

685
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,840
I didn't catch him.

686
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,120
Really?

687
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,280
I heard that the criminal is a man and a woman.

688
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,480
The man is recognized by the governor of Jiangsu.

689
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,760
But the woman...

690
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,440
No one knows who the man is.

691
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,080
I don't want to know.

692
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,360
I understand.

693
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,720
I'll leave first.

694
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,000
Well...

695
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,280
Bao Jian!

696
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,680
It was her nephew.

697
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Don't mention it.

698
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,480
Never.

699
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,600
That woman didn't give anything to you.

700
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,320
No one in the future.

701
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,500
Not you, okay?

702
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,360
Where are myuiters?

703
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,320
From the bottom of the mountain.

704
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,600
No.

705
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,080
Don't ask me to set up a little fire.

706
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,660
My suit.

707
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,360
He'sursing anyway.

708
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,300
My suit,

709
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,060
there must be something inside.

710
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,220
There are people who know me.

711
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,380
So...

712
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,620
Look at you, you bastard!

713
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,300
You're still a chemistry doctor.

714
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,380
Science, science, and the way you dress.

715
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,180
You're so naughty.

716
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,780
You're so impulsive.

717
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,540
You don't look like a smart person.

718
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,020
This is called revolution.

719
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,380
It seems we can't get along.

720
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,220
Yes.

721
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,540
A little girl in a small place

722
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,740
can't understand the romantic ideal of revolution.

723
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,580
She can't understand.

724
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,860
I can't understand.

725
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,420
In the ideal, in the romantic.

726
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,740
You have to think about it.

727
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,140
But you're so naughty.

728
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,260
You shouldn't have thought about it when you were young.

729
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,980
You shouldn't have thought about the romantic ideal of revolution.

730
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,100
You can't say that.

731
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,420
You're going to Japan.

732
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,580
You don't understand.

733
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,660
What romantic is?

734
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Romantic is not allowed to be called a man.

735
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,020
The beauty of the sky, the sea, the sea, the fish, the sky, the fish, the earth, the mountains.

736
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,500
That's the spirit and the courage.

737
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,460
Stop it.

738
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,740
From the first day we met, you're so good.

739
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,980
You're so beautiful.

740
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,740
Okay.

741
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,460
I'll play the piano for you.

742
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,620
Play the piano for you, okay?

743
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,220
Let me ask you.

744
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,940
Once you're in love,

745
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,860
how can we live?

746
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,380
Do you have a house in Japan?

747
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,100
Do you have enough money?

748
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,220
Will the police chase us?

749
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,220
Food, clothes, and days.

750
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,500
Are you sure?

751
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,700
I'm not sure.

752
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,500
Jiuhong.

753
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,860
Until now,

754
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,900
you don't know your identity.

755
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,940
People know me?

756
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,140
Who?

757
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,340
Wang MingTFAN,

758
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,900
I came from Eastern Partisan University.

759
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,940
It's just a dream.

760
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,540

00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,500

00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,340
A fugitive who is ole Mah nagging the different world.

767
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,820
Me, you, too.

768
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,820
and the drunkard of the Zhu Lian Jiu Clan.

769
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,620
That is to say,

770
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,620
my father, my mother, my sister,

771
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,620
they all will say we are a thousand tears.

772
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,820
My neighbors will know.

773
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,220
The second Miss of the Kowtow House

774
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,220
and a man who is not clear about her name

775
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,220
are together to fight in Shanghai.

776
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,220
That's about it.

777
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,720
I will say it in Japanese.

788
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,820
They don't look like each other.

Attention, soldiers.

793
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,820

808
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,820

809
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,820

814
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,820
Why are there so many Chinese people?

815
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,420
No big surprise.

816
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,820
In Tokyo, there are tens of thousands of Chinese students.

817
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,220
Most of them are from the Shintian generation.

818
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,220
Really?

819
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,820
So, even if you don't speak Japanese, it's okay.

820
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,420
There's nothing like that in ten thousand Chinese people.

821
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,020
A big student like me and a girl like you

822
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,020
can live as you like.

823
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,020
Big brother!

824
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,220
Just stay here and talk.
