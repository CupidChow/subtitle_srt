1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I want my nutrition and good taste.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You Sun Ru, please tell us the wonderful moment.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But now facing this situation,

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
will you still love him?

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So,

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
he is actually a fate of the nation.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now he is very beautiful.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is so hard to solve.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is there a problem?

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come again?

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
Please let me handle this.

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,800
Mr. Xin.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
We don't have any problems,

60
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,400
butChar sfom對於這個,

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,000
I think it's very important

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,340
to look at tears in the meaning of

63
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,300
pursuing aе

64
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,240
your future dream.

65
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,740
I only know this feeling.

66
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,740
What are you doing?

67
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,740
I'm buying dangerous chemical products.

68
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
If you don't move yourself into Japanese,

69
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
they might not sell you.

70
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
I know.

71
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,740
This is a kind of a luxury market, right?

72
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,740
You are very considerate.

73
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,740
In the world, Japanese are the people's people.

74
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,740
Chinese are the slaves of the people.

75
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
The enemy is the first.

76
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
What a stupid reason!

77
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,740
You are mistaken.

78
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,740
You are mistaken.

79
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,740
You are mistaken.

80
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,740
I really underestimated you.

81
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,740
Come, put this on.

82
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,740
Then they won't be suspicious.

83
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,740
You go with me.

84
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,740
We are like a group of Japanese.

85
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,740
This way, we can protect the city more successfully.

86
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
Is this okay?

87
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,740
It's not okay.

88
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,740
Only you dare to do it.

89
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,740
What is this?

90
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
What is this?

91
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
What is this?

92
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Is this a good one?

93
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
No.

94
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Do you understand?

95
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,740
This...

96
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Ren Jun, why do you have to be so generous?

97
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,740
Why are you so familiar with my money?

98
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,740
Don't be stupid.

99
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,740
Do you want to see him?

100
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,740
You are so lucky.

101
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,740
I have nothing to do with it.

102
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,740
Ren Jun, a gentleman loves wealth.

103
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Don't always listen to me.

104
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Don't you know that?

105
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Yang Kai is the biggest financial man in our house.

106
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,740
He brought such a little diary two days ago.

107
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
At least 2000 yuan.

108
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Really?

109
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,740
I mean, Liang Xiang, don't be so serious.

110
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,740
You are so kind.

111
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
Actually, if someone else has money,

112
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
they can't compare you.

113
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,740
You are a prince's relative.

114
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,740
That's not possible.

115
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,740
Stop it.

116
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,740
You think it's a bad idea?

117
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
What does the prince have to do with it?

118
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,740
I found that in Japanese,

119
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,740
the most important word is not there.

120
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,740
What?

121
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
Sato.

122
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,740
Sato?

123
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,740
It's a good word for Sato.

124
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,740
You can shout it out.

125
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Sato!

126
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,740
You can sing like a singer.

127
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,740
Sato.

128
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
You can shout it out.

129
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
Sato.

130
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
You can shout it out.

131
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Sato.

132
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,740
You are a man.

133
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
You have so many Chinese words.

134
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
You like Sato.

135
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
I just want to know

136
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,740
if you use Japanese words to say Sato.

137
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,740
Is it so easy to say?

138
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,740
In my opinion, the most important word in Japanese is

139
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,740
I want to be a monkey.

140
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Monkey?

141
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
You are right.

142
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,740
I know.

143
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,740
Look, we have so many Japanese words.

144
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,740
We eat, sleep,

145
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,740
clothes, water, toilet,

146
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
we can't use them all.

147
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
But we can use them all

148
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
as long as we want to.

149
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,740
Really?

150
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,740
I want to be a monkey.

151
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,740
I want to be a monkey.

152
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
I want to be a monkey.

153
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,740
It's so useful.

154
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Monkey.

155
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Monkey.

156
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Monkey.

157
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Monkey.

158
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
Monkey.

159
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
What do you mean by monkey?

160
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,740
There is no one on the side of our house.

161
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,740
There is no one on the side of our house.

162
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,740
There are men and women.

163
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
You just need to say

164
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,740
I want to be monkey.

165
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
You said it like this.

166
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
People will understand.

167
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
You want women?

168
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
What do you want?

169
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Good evening, sir.

170
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,740
Good evening, madam.

171
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,740
How can I help you?

172
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,740
Do you know that my wife always complains to me

173
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,740
about that two lice at home are hard to clean?

174
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
For so long.

175
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Right, my darling?

176
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Two lice under one sink or three neat clean.

177
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
What can I do for you?

178
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Yes.

179
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,740
I need two thousand milliliters of junk,

180
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,740
as said, for her only.

181
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Really? So much?

182
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
You cannot use it at all.

183
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:39,740
No, I have said I need two thousand milliliters.

184
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,740
My wife is fond of clean.

185
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,740
As you wish.

186
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
For the sake of this beautiful lady,

187
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,740
normally we cannot sell too much.

188
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Strong acid.

189
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Sex.

190
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,740
Too much.

191
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
Excuse me.

192
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,740
May I ask you a question?

193
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,740
What's the matter, madam?

194
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,740
It's about the lice.

195
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,740
What's the matter with the lice?

196
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
The lice?

197
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Yes.

198
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,740
The lice is very scary.

199
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,740
It will come out at night.

200
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,740
There are so many things around here.

201
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
It's scary.

202
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,740
What should I do?

203
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
It's dirty.

204
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
I'll go and get some food.

205
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,740
What should I do?

206
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Young people may have a way,

207
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,740
but it's a bit more difficult.

208
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
I thought about many ways,

209
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
but I really can't do anything.

210
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Excuse me.

211
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Goodbye.

212
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Is this beauty mute?

213
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Mr. Yu,

214
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,740
why do you say so many words?

215
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
And you have courage.

216
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
It's time to go.

217
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
What?

218
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
I'm going to the East Yang Kuo.

219
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
You're going to the East Yang Kuo?

220
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,740
You're going to the beautiful lady in the East Yang Kuo?

221
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,740
I can't speak Japanese.

222
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,740
I can teach you.

223
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Really?

224
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
Now?

225
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Listen.

226
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Pay attention to my accent and pronunciation.

227
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

228
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
What does it mean?

229
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
The meaning of Chinese is you're great.

230
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,740
You're great.

231
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

232
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

233
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
Yes.

234
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,740
Repeat it twice.

235
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

236
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

237
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

238
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Very good.

239
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Remember,

240
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
you can only say it to me in the future.

241
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Don't say it to others.

242
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

243
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,740
This is the real high-pitched flu.

244
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Do you know, Qiu Hong,

245
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,740
I will be a great person in the future.

246
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

247
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

248
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

249
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

250
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

251
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

252
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

253
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Qiu Hong,

254
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,740
I will cherish the whole of China,

255
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,740
okay?

256
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,740
I will cherish the whole of China.

257
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

258
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

259
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Kujizukaio imasu.

260
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
You can go back first.

261
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
I have to work.

262
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
It's too important.

263
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,740
Everyone is waiting for my success.

264
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,740
I will be a great person in the future.

265
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,740
I will be a great person in the future.

266
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I will be a great person in the future.

267
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
I will be a great person in the future.

268
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Liang Xiang.

269
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Come here.

270
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Liang Xiang.

271
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,740
The vice president of Shanghai Chamber of Commerce,

272
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Song Baochuan,

273
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,740
wants to ask me to do something for you.

274
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
Song Baochuan?

275
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Yes.

276
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
I don't know her.

277
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,740
She asked you to do something.

278
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,740
But you did it.

279
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Don't you know her?

280
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
What can I do for her

281
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
as a soldier?

282
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
I heard that

283
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,740
you are very popular with the prince recently.

284
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
I...

285
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Shanghai Chamber of Commerce

286
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
is going to have a dinner.

287
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,740
I want to invite the prince to show you a face.

288
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
Don't worry.

289
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
It's just a face.

290
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Well,

291
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,740
what's the point?

292
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Help me.

293
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Please show me a face.

294
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
That's all.

295
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,740
Do you think it's enough?

296
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
Where did you go?

297
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,740
I went shopping on the street.

298
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,740
Can't I?

299
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
You really plan to be a student here?

300
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
Or your class is not full.

301
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Do you think I really just want you to help me?

302
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
Brother-in-law,

303
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,740
you don't want to take my tuition, do you?

304
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Don't talk about this kind of talk.

305
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,740
Even if you spend money,

306
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,740
you can hear this kind of lesson.

307
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,740
Can there be such a level teacher outside?

308
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Not bad at all.

309
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,740
Your teacher's level is really high.

310
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Qiu Hu.

311
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,740
What else?

312
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,740
Three girls just got a job.

313
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
They live with you.

314
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
They are in the room now.

315
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
Take care of them for me.

316
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
You need them in life.

317
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Find them in the wrong place.

318
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
I got it.

319
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,740
You're back, Senior.

320
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,740
Are you new here?

321
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
Yes.

322
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
We are all new here.

323
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
New student girls.

324
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Student girls?

325
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
What is student girls?

326
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,740
What is this?

327
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
This is the rule.

328
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
What rule?

329
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
First meeting of student girls.

330
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Then you need to make secret contact.

331
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
And contact?

332
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,740
Senior is definitely asking us.

333
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Jingwen, let's have a try.

334
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
Where did you come from?

335
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
From the east.

336
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
Where did you bring your home?

337
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,740
From China.

338
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,740
Why did you come here?

339
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,740
Write down the situation.

340
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Who are your friends?

341
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Sun Wen, Huang Xin, Tao Chenzhang.

342
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Okay, wait a minute.

343
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Wang Ya.

344
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
You are a loyal student.

345
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
Why can't you focus on your studies?

346
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
I understand.

347
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
I just need to get him back.

348
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Wait a minute.

349
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Let him in.

350
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,740
Tell him if you have something to say.

351
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Yes.

352
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
I will go.

353
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,740
Wang Ya.

354
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
Don't mention that bastard.

355
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,740
I understand.

356
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,740
I have been reading the ancient writing on the way.

357
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
I read it today

358
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,740
when Li Ling was a fierce slave.

359
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
He wrote a letter to brother Han.

360
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
I was very emotional.

361
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
Didn't you hear?

362
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
No.

363
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Dam aged people.

364
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
I want to partake in a boy concept.

365
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,340
Then why didn't the young soldiers

366
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
purchase me the drink or everinquentially mine?

367
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,540
Be considerate.

368
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,160
In those words,

369
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,760
we have become brothers will.

370
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,500
This is a state in Germany.

371
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm not a new horse, am I?

372
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
What do you mean?

373
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,500
When I was born, I didn't leave the Prince of Zhengqian.

374
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,500
My brother-in-law was the emperor of the present day.

375
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:47,500
In this way, I have to be cautious when I make a small move.

376
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I'm not a new horse, am I?

377
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Just like the goldfish in this river,

378
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,500
I live in a clear village, and I'm a common man.

379
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
You probably don't have any experience.

380
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Even if you are a new horse,

381
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
I understand what you mean.

382
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Don't call me Prince.

383
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I can't stand it.

384
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,500
On this road, I don't know what I did wrong.

385
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Why everyone is giving me a good life?

386
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm me.

387
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
My brother is my brother.

388
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,500
And that dog-nose-hunter.

389
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm a new horse.

390
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
But the price of the flower is so high.

391
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I'm not a new horse.

392
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm a new horse.

393
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Don't tell me I won't go.

394
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Do you understand?

395
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
The flower on the stone is a forest.

396
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Do you understand?

397
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I've been a new horse for a long time.

398
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I'm not a new horse.

399
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I'm a new horse.

400
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
I'm a new horse.

401
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm a new horse.

402
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm a new horse.

403
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I don't know what to do with it.

404
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
I don't know what to do with it.

405
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm a new horse.

406
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I'll do it.

407
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
The flower should be invited.

408
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
I've got it.

409
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Yes.

410
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Well, don't use my name.

411
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Use Shanghai's name.

412
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Security police will take charge of the entire Shanghai bureau.

413
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Yes.

414
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
We can't be the chief.

415
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
The chief must be the royal concubine.

416
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I'll go.

417
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Is it done?

418
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
This bill is more reliable than the one we know in Japan.

419
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I added a insurance.

420
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
This is the deal.

421
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
It's enough.

422
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,500
The amount of money and the amount of money is enough to make my lab full of trash.

423
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Use it to kill the Prince Chun who is coming to protect you.

424
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
To save you.

425
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
What are you going to do?

426
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,500
The Shanghai Bureau will have a box of clothes tonight.

427
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
To make Prince Chun happy.

428
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I can make a wedding dress.

429
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
But I need a helper.

430
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Otherwise, I can't do it through the inspection of the police station.

431
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Tell me.

432
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Who?

433
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Your sister Qiu Hong.

434
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Are you crazy?

435
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Why did you pull her in?

436
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Because she's your relative.

437
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
You're Li Xing Ge's life.

438
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
You can sacrifice others' lives, not your own relative.

439
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I...

440
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I didn't mean that.

441
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
What do you mean?

442
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
I know her.

443
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
She's a girl from a small place.

444
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
She knows nothing.

445
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
She doesn't know anything.

446
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Because she doesn't know anything.

447
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
She doesn't know anything.

448
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
She's pure and natural.

449
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
She's not a member of the group.

450
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
She's not in our revolution.

451
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Not including these ordinary people.

452
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Is she ordinary?

453
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
No.

454
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
She's not ordinary.

455
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Even in my opinion,

456
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
she's very talented.

457
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
I know her better than you do.

458
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
I don't.

459
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Or

460
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
you can ask her opinion.

461
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
I'm sorry.

462
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Hello, Mr. Xia.

463
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Qiu Hong.

464
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Come in.

465
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
What's wrong?

466
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
I don't know.

467
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
What's wrong with you and Yutian Bai?

468
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Answer me.

469
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
You're still smiling.

470
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
I remember Mr. Chen's class.

471
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
He said

472
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
that we Chinese

473
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
don't have a father and brother.

474
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
One is a man and a woman.

475
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
They're happy.

476
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
What?

477
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Answer my question.

478
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Don't pull the car.

479
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Go ahead.

480
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,500
What's wrong with you?

481
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Who's wrong with me?

482
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Are you two together?

483
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
We're definitely together.

484
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
I should have told you earlier.

485
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
What do you want to tell me?

486
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
That's a handsome and sincere man.

487
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
You know?

488
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
And he's married.

489
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
The father and the sister,

490
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
they really do treat each other finely.

491
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
With a wedding gown,

492
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,960
like the bastard in Marriage прибoy

493
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,500
he gotten into a fight with an orphan.

494
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
pain with a son

495
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
little sister

496
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Why do you respectiveufing it so well in your comrades'

497
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
family comprehensive Kumar

498
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
I'll ask someone to buy you a ticket.

499
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
You can call me back today.

500
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
No, I don't want to go back.

501
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
You must go back.

502
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
How is he?

503
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
I knew he wouldn't listen to you.

504
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
I've said it before.

505
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm the best teacher in this school.

506
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
I'll go get some water.

507
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Hello.

508
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Hello.

509
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Hello.

510
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Hello.

511
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Come on, put it here.

512
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Don't be stupid.

513
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Put it here.

514
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Put it here.

515
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Put it here.

516
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Don't be stupid.

517
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Wait for me outside.

518
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
What are you doing again?

519
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I ate all the food.

520
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I can't spend a few big pieces.

521
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
I'm so worried about you.

522
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
I can't take it.

523
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
The leader just said

524
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
six soldiers are in the same class tonight.

525
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Where is my brother?

526
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
You can't take it.

527
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Xiao Ye, you're special.

528
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
You can't be short.

529
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
You have to be polite.

530
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Now,

531
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
many people are fighting with the court.

532
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
They've been against you in the past.

533
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Now they're against you.

534
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Empress Dowager has lost the capital.

535
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Now they're fighting with each other.

536
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
When you're in Japan,

537
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
you can't fight with your black power.

538
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Listen to me.

539
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
We've put a price on it.

540
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
We're close to our classmates.

541
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
The high school is far away.

542
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
You don't depend on your classmates.

543
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm not good enough to

544
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
be able to fight with my black power.

545
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
You're good at reminding me.

546
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
The leader is here again.

547
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Look at you.

548
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Can't you feel it?

549
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Xiao Ye is going to the boat tonight.

550
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
We'll see each other again.

551
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Stop it.

552
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Do you hear me?

553
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Don't come again tonight.

554
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Look at you.

555
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
You're a sensible man.

556
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Come on. Listen to you.

557
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I won't let you go.

558
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
I won't let you go.

559
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
But you have to take care of me.

560
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Please rest assured.

561
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Please rest assured.

562
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Xiao Yu.

563
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
When you look at the sea,

564
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
you can't take care of me.

565
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
You

566
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
have no right to

567
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
take care of me.

568
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Get up.

569
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Listen to me.

570
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Listen to me.

571
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Get up.

572
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Get up.

573
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Let's go.

574
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
The leader is

575
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
a bloody man.

576
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Right, Liang Xiang.

577
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Did you bring the iron

578
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
from the stage?

579
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
I did.

580
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
I brought it from the last night.

581
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
That's great.

582
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
That's great.

583
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I'll teach you a lesson.

584
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Liang Xiang.

585
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
You're different from other

586
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
imperial sons.

587
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
You're different from others.

588
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
You're different from others.

589
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Where can I go?

590
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
This hall is full of

591
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
famous people.

592
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
They're coming in

593
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
as soon as you leave.

594
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Why are you so anxious?

595
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
You're going to marry him?

596
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
I heard from your brother-in-law

597
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
that when your mother

598
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
gave you the big house

599
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
in the Song family in the sea,

600
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
you asked him

601
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
if you could go to the farthest place.

602
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
You went to the big house in the peace.

603
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
If you want to marry him,

604
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
you can go to the other house.

605
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
No.

606
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Where did you go to?

607
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
It's nothing, aunt.

608
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
I think the school is good.

609
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
The teacher is good.

610
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
I'm not suitable

611
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
for a student like me.

612
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
I'm leaving, aunt.

613
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Chihong.

614
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
I've already called a car for you.

615
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Just downstairs.

616
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I'm doing this for your own good.

617
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Are you ready?

618
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
You made a car for me.

619
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
You said you're a man.

620
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
You said you're a man.

621
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
You came here every day.

622
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Yan Bai.

623
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Do you want to find someone to look after you?

624
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
It's a problem

625
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
when things are going well.

626
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
I can't afford to do it tonight.

627
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
I can't let you go.

628
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
You want to go alone?

629
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Let's see who's going to go.

630
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Okay.

631
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Excuse me.

632
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Is Mr. Chen living here?

633
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
You are...

634
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
I have Mr. Chen's name card.

635
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
I want to go to the library.

636
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Mr. Chen has been back for two days.

637
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
It's nothing.

638
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Thank you.

639
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Chihong.

640
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Chihong.

641
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Chihong.

642
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Mr. Chen, catch me.

643
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Go to the dock.

644
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Don't stop.

645
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Go to the dock.

646
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Go to the dock.

647
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Sorry, I have something to do with him.

648
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
I'm done.

649
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
I'm done.

650
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Go.

651
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
I'm done.

652
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
I'm done.

653
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
I'm done.

654
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
I'm done.

655
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Who's that?

656
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
I'm done.

657
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
If you leave today,

658
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
we won't see each other again.

659
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Can you read the text?

660
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Your brother-in-law Raminated our relationship.

661
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
It's a big deal.

662
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
It's not necessary.

663
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
But this is the most beautiful and touching

664
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
chemical reaction in the world.

665
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
It's not a professional at all.

666
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
You are really a chemical doctor.

667
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
That's right.

668
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
You taught those girls chemical medicine.

669
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Not anyone has your spiritual power.

670
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
They are all stupid.

671
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
I don't think you are that easy to get nervous.

672
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
I said you are easy.

673
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
But you just saw me turning around.

674
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
It seems like I did something that I can't see.

675
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
I just thought about it.

676
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
I can't see you anymore.

677
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
I'll go back to my quiet place.

678
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Can't I?

679
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Of course you can.

680
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
You have this right.

681
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
That's enough.

682
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Yes, you can go back to your quiet place

683
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
and then follow your father's instructions

684
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
to marry that rich little man.

685
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
I'm still giving birth to three or four boys and girls.

686
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
I'm still giving birth to three or four boys and girls.

687
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
I'm still giving birth to three or four boys and girls.

688
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Bless them and bring them together soon.

689
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
I'll protect and make them happy.

690
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
But I have to say,

691
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
you need to be simple as that.

692
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
They are called famous Waynares.

693
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Why did you say that?

694
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Are you kidding?

695
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I have beenertosome like that.

696
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
What?

697
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Yes.

698
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Why did a man of a family

699
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,320
rotation an ordinary and self-discipline

700
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,500
alom every morning?

701
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,300
Why did a man come this evening?

702
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,300
I can feel a pure, pure quality on you.

703
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
You're here to fool me again?

704
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
I'm serious.

705
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,300
The idea you gave your sister

706
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
made me so surprised.

707
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
A girl from a small place,

708
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,300
so bright,

709
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,300
a simple way to solve the problem.

710
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
What? I don't understand.

711
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
You suggest a woman to help you with the class?

712
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
What's the point?

713
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
It's great.

714
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
The world is still a girl's world.

715
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
The solution is simple.

716
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
It's just a stone.

717
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
It's precious.

718
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Your inner spirit.

719
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
Are you serious?

720
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,300
I'm very accurate.

721
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Qiu Hong, stay.

722
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Let's do it together.

723
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
I need you.

724
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
I was going to say...

725
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
You don't need any.

726
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
You're a book.

727
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,300
You're the author of this book.

728
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,300
You decide what kind of person you will be in the future.

729
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Shi Liu.

730
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,300
Why?

731
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
A grand occasion came in the evening.

732
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Come with me,

733
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
and dress up.

734
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Just like last time,

735
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,300
I'll be your wife.

736
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,840
1949

737
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,160
Jigu

738
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,960
What did you say?

739
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,980
I asked you to neutralize the Japanese treating효天白

740
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,260
Twenty% of the sales tonight

741
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,560
got rotating the ticket

742
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,720
That's right.

743
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,280
Two second-hand hide in the Japanese cruise ship.

744
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,280
He told me that we can't stay in Shanghai anymore.

745
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,000
I think he's really afraid of the safety of the college.

746
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,360
No one can convince him about this.

747
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,200
He just wants to move to the ground today. What can you do?

748
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,240
Come in.

749
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,200
Your Highness, this is the captain of the German cruise ship, Bayanhao.

750
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,000
Mr. Bu Laon.

751
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,880
He's an elf here, the imprecent student.

752
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,280
He can serve the King, Bayanhao is a great man.

753
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,600
Thank you, captain.

754
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,840
The ship is tomorrow.

755
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,240
Thank you, Mr. Blea Morgan.

756
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,680
Yes, my prince. We're the Morgan's again.

757
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,400
The first station is Hong Kong.

758
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,720
The King will be in Hong Kong tomorrow.

759
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,680
The King is not here to attend the banquet.

760
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,840
It's not like there's a difference.

761
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,520
The King's heart says that the son won't have such an arrangement.

762
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,400
The invitation is sent out. He's thinking about opening the carriage.

763
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,080
But you told me that the main character is not here.

764
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,800
The royal family is in a bad mood. What can you do?

765
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,240
What's wrong, Bao Quan?

766
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,880
Don't be angry.

767
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,800
The King is not here.

768
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,200
We have to continue this banquet.

769
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,880
We can eat it ourselves. We'll all be free.

770
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,600
You know how to do it.

771
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,480
You really know how to do it.

772
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,680
I'll go and look for the master.

773
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,520
Ask him to look for the master.

774
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,560
What happened, Bao Quan?

775
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,000
His thought has grown so much that the honourableheap is absent.

776
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,600
That you're abandoning the royal family...

777
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,760
you will have to pay for every kind of punishment.

778
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,480

779
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,580
Move, please.

780
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,080
速達大人命令

781
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,080
All the guests are symptomatic.

782
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,200
We do duty, do not bugle.

783
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,840
It is best

784
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,600
the same person I thought...

785
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,940
is Qiu Hong.

786
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,000
Look into theすすすс

787
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,900

788
00:42:49,440 --> 00:43:02,340
and then secondly

789
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,460
turn over and take off

790
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,580
Does this be considered clear?

791
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
I'm not sure if I can do it.
