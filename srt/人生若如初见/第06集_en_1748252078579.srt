1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Where are you going?

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I've got my hands dirty.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm a Chinese.

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm a Chinese.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm a Chinese.

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm a Chinese.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm a Chinese.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going out.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll be there in three or five days.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Take care of yourself.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where are you going?

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm really going out.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let me tell you this.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My job is to be a professional.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm a professional.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't understand.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But I have to pay for our room and dinner.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Wait for me to come back.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm home.

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mr. Okami.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please come in.

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You still don't have anything to do.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's wrong?

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How many days will you be working?

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Really?

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What day is it?

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a business.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's good to make money.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But it's hard to recover.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Business?

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm a business satelite.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So I'm living in a bigger house.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No way.

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't have a business.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't have a business.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't you want to run away again?

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll run away.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm a business person.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm a business person.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm a business person.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What do you mean?

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Miss.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I know you better than you do.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Are you studying Japanese?

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're good at it.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have two books.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll bring them if I find them.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll take them.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No way.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm a business person.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't have a business.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm a business person.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm a business person.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm a business person.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm a business person.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's raining.

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Wake up.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm too early to sleep.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Wake up.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wake up.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We should have gone faster.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If you don't mind, I'd appreciate it even if I had to live alone.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're free to drink.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you sleeping separately?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're not lying.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
They say that a cat despises stadium, but we sleep together.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You mean you can stay here?

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I've never been to a hotel like this before.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's the reason?

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why?

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you have any other reasons?

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why do you think I'm doing this?

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I want to be told that I love a man.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You love him?

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Did he tell you that?

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's been staying here since he first came to Tokyo.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I was always beautiful back then.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I understand.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So you can't trust a man.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Where did you get the clouds?

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What's your business?

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What kind of business can you do?

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Drink it.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm going to the beach.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm going.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can't afford to stay here anymore.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's the cheapest in Tokyo.

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What do you think Chinese people think of us?

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We're rich.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a good thing you said that you're going to the beach.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to the beach.

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Welcome home.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry. I'm not a good person.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's okay.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm not going to tell you that I'm going to the beach.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm going to the beach.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm going to the beach.

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm going to the beach.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm going to Tokyo.

178
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What's your name?

179
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How many big pigs are there?

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
All of them are joys.

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Continue your meal.

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, sir.

183
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Who did you see raising the pig's head?

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I saw the pig's head.

185
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's a god.

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You're Chinese gods?

187
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't know where this country's gods are.

188
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm just raising the horse at home.

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm a senior in the field of manga.

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So I'm a god.

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I see.

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're a god-groomed man for that black pig.

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have a cold.

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I have 10 pigs.

195
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll eat the pig's meat next year.

196
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Itohe, Liao-kyo.

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes, sir.

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You don't have to do the pig's business.

199
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You should train the army.

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Got it?

201
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes, sir.

202
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll go.

203
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Hurry up.

204
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Go to the front.

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hurry up.

206
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Go to the front.

207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Go to the front.

208
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why did you raise the pig's head?

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You're a big man.

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're not.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You're carrying the army's army.

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes.

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm the lowest in the field.

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't carry the army.

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're carrying the soldiers' guns.

216
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Look.

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I have the army's weapons and the army's weapons.

218
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I carry the weapons for five days.

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You bastard.

220
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What should I do?

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I've sent five of them home.

222
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Japan has a chance.

223
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're so good.

224
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All of you.

225
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Start the wild operation.

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes, sir.

227
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Go.

228
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Go.

229
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Go.

230
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Go.

231
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It seems that the pig's head is much easier.

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Go.

233
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Come.

234
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Look at the Japanese soldiers.

235
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
They have a 24-kilometer army as well.

236
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Go.

237
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Did you get the gun?

238
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes, sir.

239
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've got the gun.

240
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You can't just get the gun.

241
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You don't have to use it.

242
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Chinese soldiers are the same.

243
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
They can do it.

244
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why can't you do it?

245
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You want to make my army pay for it?

246
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This mountain is more dangerous than Kawashima.

247
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Go.

248
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Come to the imperial council.

249
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Make sure you don't get any trouble.

250
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes, sir.

251
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Go.

252
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Go.

253
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Tell me.

254
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What do you want to play?

255
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can't go there.

256
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't believe it.

257
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Are you the captain of the army?

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're the captain.

259
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll give you the stone.

260
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Who can make the hole?

261
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The soldiers are making the hole.

262
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We have a good army.

263
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Look at the soil.

264
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Go down.

265
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Go down.

266
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Go down.

267
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Go down.

268
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What are you looking at?

269
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Go down.

270
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Go.

271
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm looking forward to the battle.

272
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Go down.

273
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Go down.

274
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Go down.

275
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Itohe, go.

276
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes, sir.

277
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The commander is in a situation where the soldiers are caught.

278
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's the first time I'm allowed to talk.

279
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Do you understand?

280
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm here to meet the commander.

281
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Itohe, I'm here to meet you.

282
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm here to meet you.

283
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You've been caught in the first day.

284
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Actually, you don't have it?

285
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm here to meet you.

286
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm from China.

287
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Who are you from?

288
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm from a family.

289
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm your mother.

290
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Your mother?

291
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes, I'm from China.

292
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm from China.

293
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The high-ranking family is rich in Chinese.

294
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's a beautiful letter.

295
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Itohe, I'm here to meet you.

296
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm here to meet you.

297
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm here to meet you.

298
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm here to meet you.

299
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm here to meet you.

300
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm here to meet you.

301
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm here to meet you.

302
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm here to meet you.

303
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm here to meet you.

304
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm here to meet you.

305
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm here to meet you.

306
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's all 60 yen.

307
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Do you want to pay?

308
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm here to meet you.

309
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm here to meet you.

310
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm here to meet you.

311
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What's your name?

312
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm from China.

313
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You're so expensive.

314
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You're from China?

315
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You're from China, too.

316
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Ah, you're green.

317
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
tofu?

318
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm from China.

319
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You're green.

320
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Are you from China?

321
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
No.

322
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
OOO, it's from Chen Possum.

323
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Are you from China?

324
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm a зрмер.

325
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But how 다시?"

326
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
See you later.

327
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I speak her name lot.

328
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
My house is also sold.

329
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Really?

330
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
A Chinese girl, how can she sell her pen to Tokyo?

331
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
My house is not that expensive.

332
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,800
Then what are you doing in Tokyo?

333
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,400
What are you doing in Tokyo?

334
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,400
See? That painting is my painting.

335
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,200
Look.

336
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
We will keep a secret during this month.

337
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,600
Yes.

338
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
Do you want to buy one?

339
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,800
I don't want to buy this.

340
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,480
I came here to ask if the shopkeeper needs a hand.

341
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,200
I need money.

342
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Wait a minute.

343
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,680
Let's see if I can help you.

344
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Okay.

345
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm glad to see you.

346
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
What's wrong?

347
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm done.

348
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,080
The boss wants you to work next week.

349
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,240
The monthly salary is 35 yuan.

350
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,360
Your job is to help the shopkeeper to buy the painter.

351
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,600
If the customer sees the painting,

352
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,320
he will tell the shopkeeper to take care of the materials and the time.

353
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,920
You can tell the painter to send the materials

354
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,520
and then send the money to the painter according to the time.

355
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
What do you think?

356
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,360
It's so alive.

357
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
It's 35 yuan?

358
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,400
It's not easy.

359
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,480
The painters here are all famous in China.

360
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,200
Their works are on the tourist site in Beijing

361
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,240
and on the ten years in Shanghai.

362
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,880
It's much more expensive here.

363
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,560
These people are special in the first place.

364
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,200
The second is to mention the ancient customs.

365
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,400
If they don't make up for it,

366
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
the shopkeeper won't be able to get their paintings.

367
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,360
You're a Chinese girl.

368
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,200
I believe you can do this job.

369
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,560
Thank you.

370
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,040
You can write it down.

371
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,120
Thank you.

372
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,640
Who are you?

373
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm a painter.

374
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,080
A painter?

375
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,640
He's great!

376
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
I'm sorry.

377
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Mr. Shinkou!

378
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
I'm back.

379
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
I just had dinner with Mr. Yado.

380
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,640
Don't say that.

381
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,640
It's a secret that I told you.

382
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
I'm sorry.

383
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
Where did you go?

384
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
I'm talking to you.

385
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,640
I'm not asking you. Where have you been these days?

386
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
What's in your hand? Let me see.

387
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Can't you control it?

388
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
He Tou!

390
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
You... You found a job!

391
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Who told you to find me?

392
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Who told you to find me?

393
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Is it necessary to find you?

394
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
I don't want to see no face.

395
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,640
You can't do it. I won't let you do it.

396
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
I won't do it if you say no.

397
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
You're not suitable.

398
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
Why am I not suitable?

399
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm like this.

400
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,640
I'm a rich man. I have to buy vegetables with a single word.

401
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Can anyone give me 35 yuan per month?

402
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,640
Do you think they'll see you do it?

403
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
I can't say I can.

404
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
I met a big talker. He helped me.

405
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
Why did he help you?

406
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Why don't you think about it?

407
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm willing to do it.

408
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I said I can't do it.

409
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
I know them.

410
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
There are several bad painters.

411
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
You give him a painting and get him money.

412
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
He'll give you 35 yuan per month.

413
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
You're so stupid.

414
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
I forgot it. You're a painter too.

415
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Me? What me?

416
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
I almost forgot it.

417
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
It's the first time we met. You're a painter.

418
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Don't talk to them.

419
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
You're so stupid. You should be a painter.

420
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
You're a fool.

421
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
You don't want to thank me.

422
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
You're so stupid.

423
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
We're going to work tomorrow.

424
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
You're so stupid.

425
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Xiu Hong.

426
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Xiu Hong.

427
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
I know you didn't sleep.

428
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Actually, we should have talked earlier.

429
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Did you hear me?

430
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm sorry.

431
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
I'm sorry.

432
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Do you know, Dao Qiu Hong,

433
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,640
you and I are in the same era.

434
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
The Great Era.

435
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
The so-called Great Era

436
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,640
is not the era of death, but life.

437
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Do you know that

438
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,640
China has never been

439
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,640
a great change since the beginning of the Great Era?

440
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
The government is a blessing.

441
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
The country is the main power.

442
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
What should we do?

443
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
We should watch it grow?

444
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
That's why

445
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
we need to

446
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
change the fate of the country

447
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
in the long run.

448
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,640
The fate of China is in our hands.

449
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
In my dream,

450
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,640
I can't help but

451
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
think about the fate of the country

452
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
and the fate of the country.

453
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
What I want to do in the future

454
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
is to open a new chapter for China.

455
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
That's my idea.

456
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
You can watch it, right?

457
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
You can watch it, right?

458
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
I'll keep my word.

459
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,640
You can't do it without my permission.

460
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
What does that mean?

461
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,640
It's not the result you get.

462
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
It's the process.

463
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,640
The real meaning is the process.

464
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Didn't you say that

465
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
your purpose in life

466
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,640
is to make the quiet neighbor

467
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
praise your parents?

468
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Is that wrong?

469
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
I think

470
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
they will praise your parents one day.

471
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
That's nonsense.

472
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
How is that nonsense?

473
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
I'm serious.

474
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Things will change.

475
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
Don't believe me.

476
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,640
People will change too.

477
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
They will praise your parents one day

478
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,640
and give birth to a good daughter.

479
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
I'm already like this

480
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
and you're so fast.

481
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Are you really stupid?

482
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
No, no, no.

483
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
No, no, no.

484
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,640
I think you're a shallow and limitless person.

485
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Really.

486
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
These days, I thought

487
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
you wouldn't know how to make a living.

488
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
A shallow and limitless person

489
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
found a job for himself.

490
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
You are a woman

491
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,640
who is shallow and limitless.

492
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
Actually, everyone has a shallow and limitless person

493
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
who is shallow and limitless.

494
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Sometimes,

495
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
they are shallow and limitless.

496
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Just ignore them.

497
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
You just ignore the birds in the sky

498
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
and come to the ground.

499
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
I don't want to go to work in the painting shop.

500
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
I want to rely on my own ability.

501
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
It's not a matter of who I am.

502
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
I don't have to stop you.

503
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,640
I'm not afraid that you will be in the party.

504
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
You say that

505
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
a Chinese girl

506
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
in a capital like Tokyo

507
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
has too many troubles.

508
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
I've even been in a party like you.

509
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
What else can I do?

510
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
I want to find

511
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
another Yu Tianbai.

512
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
It's hard for me.

513
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,640
So, I'm the only one who has no second opinion.

514
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,640
You really want to find another me?

515
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
I can't find you.

516
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Go ahead.

517
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
You will go ahead.

518
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
You can go ahead.

519
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
You can go ahead.

520
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
What else can I do?

521
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
You don't believe me.

522
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
You can ask Zhong Fu.

523
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
He will be here the next day.

524
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Zhong Fu, isn't that your idol?

525
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Ask him

526
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
how he will judge me and Yu Tianbai.

527
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Mr. Chen is in Tokyo.

528
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
So?

529
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Why is he in Tokyo?

530
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Now,

531
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
he is the leader of the big camp.

532
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Some people are here.

533
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
So...

534
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Don't say that.

535
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
You are so rude.

536
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
You draw big cakes every day.

537
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Can you eat or drink?

538
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
You have to rely on your own ability to make rice.

539
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Go to sleep.

540
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I'm going to sleep.

541
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
I'm going to sleep.

542
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
I'm going to sleep.

543
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
I'm going to sleep.

544
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
I'm going to sleep.

545
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
I'm going to sleep.

546
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
I'm going to sleep.

547
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
I'm going to sleep.

548
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
I'm going to sleep.

549
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
I'm going to sleep.

550
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,640
I'm going to sleep.

551
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
I'm going to sleep.

552
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
I'm going to sleep.

553
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
I'm going to sleep.

554
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
I'm going to sleep.

555
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
I'm going to sleep.

556
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
I'm going to sleep.

557
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
I'm going to sleep.

558
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
I'm going to sleep.

559
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
I'm going to sleep.

560
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
I'm going to sleep.

561
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
I'm going to sleep.

562
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
I'm going to sleep.

563
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
I'm going to sleep.

564
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
I'm going to sleep.

565
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
I'm going to sleep.

566
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
I'm going to sleep.

567
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
I'm going to sleep.

568
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
I did it today.

569
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,640
I'm satisfied with the results of the combat operation

570
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,640
that I received in my army.

571
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I've discussed with the Kawashima

572
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
and the Japanese army

573
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
about how far you can do

574
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,640
with the Chinese sighting method.

575
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Let's do this.

576
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,640
You three from the Chinese sighting method.

577
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,640
You three from the dog group.

578
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
We'll do the combat operation.

579
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
That's good.

580
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
I'll do it.

581
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Get out of the way.

582
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Yes.

583
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
You are a secret.

584
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Choose two from the students in China.

585
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm a high school representative.

586
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
That's good.

587
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Yes.

588
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
I'll do it.

589
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
I'll do it.

590
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,640
The Japanese army doesn't have to choose.

591
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
You three.

592
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
You.

593
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
Yes.

594
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
You.

595
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
You.

596
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Get out of the way.

597
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
I'll do it.

598
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Yes.

599
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm a secret.

600
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
I'll do it.

601
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
The Japanese army.

602
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
Yes.

603
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Get out.

604
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Yes.

605
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
And.

606
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Don't open the door.

607
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
I'll do it.

608
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
I'll do it.

609
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Yes.

610
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Is it okay?

611
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,640
He's not going to change his clothes.

612
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Those people are not smaller than me.

613
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Why do they have to choose me?

614
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
You're bold.

615
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
You're not afraid of the sand.

616
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
You're afraid of this?

617
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
It's okay.

618
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
It's not a blow.

619
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
We're five military men.

620
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
We're old cats on the stage.

621
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
I'm not talking about him.

622
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,640
You should give the Japanese a good lesson today.

623
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
I'll do it.

624
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
I'll do it.

625
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
You should give the Japanese a good lesson today.

626
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
When you're ready,

627
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
you have to have a good time.

628
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
You have to have a good time.

629
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
I'll do it.

630
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
I'll do it.

631
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
Well.

632
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,640

YueDauJust Coll

636
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
You are absolutely right.

637
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
And,

638
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
I'm not a good singer.

639
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
I'm not even good at singing.

640
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
I'm just a little bit tired.

641
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
I can't sleep at all.

642
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
I can't even pull my pants off.

643
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
You are just a little bit lucky.

644
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,640
I'm usually a little bit lucky.

645
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,640
But I'm lucky when I'm alive.

646
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm not a little bit lucky.

647
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,640
I'm not a little bit lucky.

648
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,640
I'm not a little bit lucky.

649
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
I'm not a little bit lucky.

650
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,640
But I'm lucky when I'm alive.

651
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Let's put up a show tonight.

652
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,640
How's the third round?

653
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,640
You're looking for a match with Liang Xiang again?

654
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
No.

655
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
You have a match tonight?

656
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Liang Xiang, you have to go.

657
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,640
You want to know her.

658
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Who are you looking for?

659
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
I'm from the domestic business.

660
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,640
I just went to the court for a meeting.

661
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
A court official?

662
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,640
You know, she has a relationship with a court official.

663
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,640
I can't be a official.

664
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,640
I'm sorry.

665
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
