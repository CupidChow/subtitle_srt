The End

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 1

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Xia Zhong, come in.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're a doctor.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Come in.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Come in.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're here.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Right here.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yuanxiang, where are you going?

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why are you hitting my head?

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Look, Guike is here.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's here to help you.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
To help me?

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why are you here?

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're the owner.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You didn't recognize him?

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He's the one who hit Qin Qing's head.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's so sad.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The one behind him is Zhu's official.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So sad?

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know him.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You said that Qin Qing's family's name is here.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You haven't seen him.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You don't know him?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're so sad.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's Qin Qing's father.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You said that Liu Tian's name is here.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You don't know him?

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You don't know him?

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why should I know him?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Can I get him?

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm not going.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going with you.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I've told him.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You said that you can't get him.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm not going.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm telling you to contact him.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're in a relationship.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can get him yourself.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you going to the restaurant with me?

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or do you want to keep up with him?

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What are you doing?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You two can't go.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I have to go to the restaurant.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You two can go in and have a meal.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll go alone.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Brother.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why is my head so heavy?

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It hurts.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm going to the hospital tonight.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll go to the hospital tonight.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll go to the hospital.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Brother.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Brother Tian Yu.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you think Kai Zhi is strange?

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He is aspiritual shepherd with a low groundwater level.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
He has to be involved in the�ת innovations

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
that would suit him.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He does everything you ask.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
You saw my sister?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yourpted��?

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Just like his day of the 205th,

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
he has to be a guide.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He has to follow the rules of the world.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What does he want?

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is the biggest fear in the world.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The biggest fear in the world.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The biggest fear in the world.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The biggest fear in the world.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No one is going out.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No one is going out.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Who else is he going out with?

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Last month,

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in the heaven,

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
do you know who he has met?

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Who?

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's just a mess.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Really?

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That day,

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
he asked me to see Liang Qichao.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Just now?

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Can I see Liang Qichao?

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No one can see him.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm from the Yuan Dynasty.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The Yuan Dynasty is dead by the Kangliang Dynasty.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He did that.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He was going to the court to find the murderer.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He was already on the blacklist

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
when he left Shanghai.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Really?

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But,

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the murderer can't be found.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know why.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This guy is the leader of Liangjiang.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He is the one who recommended Liu Kui.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Moreover,

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
he is the leader of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know what to say.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He is on the back of the stage.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Where else can he find money?

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He is in the East.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Our military is deep.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's really a hidden treasure.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Brother Tu,

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
who is he?

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I came to see you personally.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm from the Yuan Dynasty.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Brother Tu.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Master Bei.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm here.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm here.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We are brothers.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We don't need to go to you.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Go.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Go, go, go.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sit.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I came from the capital.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The imperial court of the Zheng Dynasty

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
has many beautiful flowers and beautiful buildings.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The buildings are beautiful.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The glass is five-coloured and the carriage is full of the wind.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I came from Oman.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And you are a man of the imperial family.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are a soldier in Japan.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Prince Qing.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes.

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He was found in the ancestral house of the Zongren Manor.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's why Xia Wen came to the Jinzhou Qiyin to find you.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So it is.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He even reported to Empress Dowager Huang for this.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Empress Dowager is very grateful for the arrangement of the horse.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The carriage is not so deep.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's full of the prince's love.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Actually,

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
your name is far from my second name.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I know.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He is not as good as you.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He is too old-fashioned.

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If Ming'er gives him this name,

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
he will be blind.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So I don't agree.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He looks after you.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
When I came to the capital,

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
he even specially recommended me.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I was very happy.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was very happy.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He even specially recommended me to come and see you.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's great.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You really chose the right person.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He is very kind-hearted.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He is very kind-hearted.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
After I go back,

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I will report to his old man.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He will be very happy.

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This...

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is the money that the horse asked me to bring you.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This...

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is not a sale.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Definitely not.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's the public money from the court.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The horse criticized him.

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He asked you to take it

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and give it to the military in the east.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He asked me to give it to the military.

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The chaos in the east

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
is taking the military away.

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Without money,

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you can't win them.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The current court is reorganizing the military

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and building the new army.

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What's missing is the reliable

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
soldiers.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You take the money,

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
ask for a lesson,

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
do something,

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
reject the people's qi.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Resist the people's qi?

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Old man,

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
from now on,

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
don't treat yourself as a official.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You should treat yourself

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
as the future imperial military leader.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In the royal family,

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
we need a new military talent.

192
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I hope you can do it.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The new military talent is the future imperial military leader.

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The future imperial military leader is the future imperial military leader.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The future imperial military leader is the future imperial military leader.

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you for coming.

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you for coming.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You came?

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I've eaten.

201
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I...

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm going to introduce you to...

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My name is Xie Shu Hong.

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Shu Hong?

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The book sold by Shu

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and the red leaves by Hong Ye.

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Wait a minute.

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Come.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He is also Hong.

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He is prettier than me.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The official is also...

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This is also Mr. Cai's work.

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He is...

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I like it.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I like it.

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He is...

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hong.

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He is good at using it.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Come.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Give it to me.

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Two, three.

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All together.

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
All are good.

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I see.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
All are the big talkers in the shop.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You take it.

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Give it to me.

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And...

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is the map.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's also for me.

232
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And...

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This one.

234
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And...

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This one.

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is for you.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Your work today.

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The book...

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The notes.

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
All are written.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Ask for it.

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Understand?

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I understand.

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's the content of the painting.

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's a piece of paper.

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Excuse me.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is for you.

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is for you.

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Tianxiang's idea is good.

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Come.

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's talk.

253
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes.

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Hong.

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Have some tea.

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Wait.

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Tianxiang.

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I will make tea for myself.

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You say.

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I am a good person.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What can I do?

262
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can make a good book.

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Where did he go?

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He went to Mo Dianqin.

265
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Mo Dianqin?

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He helped the painter make money.

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Painter?

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What kind of painter?

269
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Cai Guangqi.

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I have dozens of them.

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I have dozens of them.

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Coming.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hello.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Is it Mr. Zhu Wendong?

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's me.

276
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I am from Wan Shan Wen's hotel.

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Come in.

278
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I have never seen you before.

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You are new here.

280
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes.

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Mr. He Xi, the boss of Wan Shan.

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He has a new painting.

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He has a painting of

284
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the whole city.

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What are you talking about?

286
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I have told him about Wan Shan.

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I have never painted

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
the painting of the palace.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well.

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a good deal.

291
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't need that money.

292
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This is the whole handkerchief.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I know it with my hands.

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This is the authentic material of the publicity.

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's not even made in Japan.

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The pen drawing

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
is used to make handkerchiefs.

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
My father also drew the pen.

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He has to use handkerchiefs

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
every time.

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There are new works

302
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and the materials are made by him.

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The paint is white and yellow.

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have used it in the shop.

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I have used it in the shop.

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have used it in the shop.

307
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I have used it in the shop.

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I have used it in the shop.

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I have used it in the shop.

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I have seen the pen drawing of the palace.

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I have used it in the shop.

312
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I have used it in the shop.

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I have used it in the shop.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
My father also likes to use it.

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He has used it in the shop.

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He doesn't.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He has called me Xue Qing.

318
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The most interesting thing is

319
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
he named me

320
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
as my sister.

321
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He calls me Xue Qing.

322
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Mr. Wan Shan.

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Where did you

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
find such a famous painter?

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Actually, there are many paintings of the palace.

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's just good.

327
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's not big.

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Mr. Qiao has a good temper.

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He is very good.

330
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He is very good at painting.

331
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He is Japanese.

332
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He can't be moved.

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He is our general.

334
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Do you think so?

335
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You little girl

336
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
is really good at business.

337
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What is the price she gave him?

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let me see.

339
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Mr. Wan Shan said

340
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
it's the top price

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
for Mr. Zhu.

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Please take a look.

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't wear glasses.

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
How can I see it?

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well...

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All right.

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Go back and tell Mr. Wan Shan

348
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to do it once.

349
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I will never draw again.

350
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Mr. Qiao is really my

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
good-for-nothing.

352
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I am the one who made it.

353
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You call him good-for-nothing?

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes.

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He is very good at painting.

356
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He is very good at painting.

357
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He is very good at painting.

358
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Do you really think

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
my good-for-nothing

360
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
is good?

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No.

362
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's good-for-nothing.

363
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Bai He is very good at dancing.

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Zhu Biao is good at singing.

365
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He is good at singing.

366
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He is a good singer.

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He is very good at painting.

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I can't see it.

369
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You are really a good singer.

370
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The captain of the Yangtze River

371
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
told me

372
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that he is very satisfied

373
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
with your performance.

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What?

375
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You are not

376
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
able to see

377
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the things that you are not good at.

378
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What is it?

379
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Tell me.

380
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's my mother.

381
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mother?

382
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

383
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I am very worried about her.

384
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Her laughter is so annoying.

385
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Really?

386
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
My mother and I are very close.

387
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
She married Qi Ying at the age of 17.

388
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She gave birth to me.

389
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Then her father passed away.

390
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
She raised me alone.

391
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's very hard.

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The golden opportunity of the royal family

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
is so great.

394
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Is it possible

395
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to let her come to Tokyo

396
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
just like a month or two?

397
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know a lot of people

398
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
who are like a wall,

399
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
a building, and a bed.

400
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Zhu Biao,

401
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you bought so many things.

402
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What's wrong?

403
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
My mother is coming to Tokyo.

404
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I have to prepare.

405
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I will help you.

406
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Your mother is coming to Tokyo?

407
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What time is it?

408
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Just two days.

409
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The Laixi管ai in Shanghai

410
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
just bought a boat ticket with her.

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Where are you staying?

412
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Your mother is a princess.

413
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't stay too long.

414
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I found a place

415
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
in the city with her.

416
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
By then,

417
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
you and Kai Zhi will come over.

418
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay.

419
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Are you still buying other things?

420
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I am not buying anything.

421
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I am just buying.

422
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I will buy you a new boat.

423
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I will buy you a new boat.

424
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I will buy you a new boat.

425
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I will buy you a new boat.

426
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I will buy you a new boat.

427
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well,

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
are you a new customer?

429
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hey, Shikuko.

430
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You

431
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
haven't told the teacher anything, have you?

432
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No.

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I haven't told her anything.

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You are so strange.

435
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Is it your fault?

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Is it because of Yosuka?

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I

438
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
can't show her a smile even if I meet her.

439
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I feel bad

440
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
that I have fallen in love with her.

441
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Why?

442
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I am here.

443
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hello.

444
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you.

445
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hello.

446
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hello.

447
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I have been waiting for you.

448
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Nice to meet you.

449
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Please come in.

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Please be careful.

451
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Welcome.

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Thank you.

453
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You must be tired.

454
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I have a message for you.

455
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Please be careful.

456
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This room is for you.

457
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It is a very nice room.

458
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Please take your time.

459
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, it is for you.

460
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Please don't move.

461
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I will go to the bathroom.

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They are coming.

463
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I will take some.

464
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh.

465
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Please come here on rainy days.

466
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It is 20 degrees.

467
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It is very nice.

468
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It is a very nice room.

469
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank you.

470
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Please come in.

471
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You are here.

472
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The business is good.

473
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It is.

474
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I can't even talk.

475
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I am sorry.

476
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
When did you call her sister?

477
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Son.

478
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes?

479
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
She is coughing all the way.

480
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why didn't you drink water?

481
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I dare not.

482
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I have to go to the hair salon.

483
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I told you to send her to the hair salon.

484
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
She is not feeling well.

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I can't get out of the room.

486
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You are so nice.

487
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It is good to live at home.

488
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It is hard to live outside.

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Son.

490
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I have not found a place to stay in the room.

491
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Where can I sleep at night?

492
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I will help you.

493
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You sleep on the floor?

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Japanese people are used to it.

495
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This shop is opened by Lord Lin Cang?

496
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
No.

497
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Lord Lin Cang has hired a doctor for you.

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So I can't bother him anymore.

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So I found this place myself.

500
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And there are many Chinese people around here.

501
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It is convenient for you to live here.

502
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Good.

503
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It is good.

504
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We can live here.

505
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Mother.

506
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I can't stay with you tonight.

507
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I have to go back to the company.

508
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I have to go with my father tomorrow.

509
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The school day is coming.

510
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That is, the door of the fish farm.

511
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The moon is passing by.

512
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It is the dragon.

513
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It is not far away.

514
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It is still a fish.

515
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It is white and white.

516
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Go.

517
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Don't worry about me.

518
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I am old.

519
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't know where the yellow soil is.

520
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Besides,

521
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
how can your mother do it?

522
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Girl.

523
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Chinese people.

524
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Come.

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I will ask you something.

526
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I can't go down.

527
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Come.

528
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Come here.

529
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You are talking about the old man?

530
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That is right.

531
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The old man is old.

532
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Am I that old?

533
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
No.

534
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You are not old.

535
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Not at all.

536
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
My mother-in-law is a soldier.

537
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We came to Hu Bei.

538
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We came here last night.

539
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Japanese people don't understand.

540
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Look.

541
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I can't find a place to eat.

542
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It is a mess.

543
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Don't worry, mother.

544
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I will ask my mother.

545
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You stay here.

546
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I will ask her.

547
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay.

548
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Thank you, girl.

549
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Come in.

550
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I have prepared breakfast for you.

551
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I didn't expect you to get up so early.

552
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Come.

553
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You use it first.

554
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
My mother will be here soon.

555
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Girl.

556
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:11,920
The winter in Japan is colder than in

557
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Japan.

558
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I can't find a chair in your house.

559
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Tell the boss.

560
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I am old.

561
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I am old.

562
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I can't sit on the floor.

563
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I have to get a board.

564
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I will go find it for you.

565
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Thank you.

566
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
How is Japan?

567
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Isn't it cold?

568
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Please be careful.

569
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Come in.

570
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Japanese is so nice.

571
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I can't understand.

572
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Thank you, girl.

573
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I didn't have a chair.

574
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I got you a chair.

575
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This is a bed.

576
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I can't sit on it.

577
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I can't sit on it.

578
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I can't sit on it.

579
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I can't sit on it.

580
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I can't sit on it.

581
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
She left me.

582
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
She left me.

583
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I can't sit on it.

584
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Fine.

585
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Take it.

586
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You are so nice.

587
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You are so nice.

588
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You are so nice.

589
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Actually, this person is a foreigner.

590
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
A foreigner?

591
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You are not from the same country as me.

592
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
No.

593
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This person is a Japanese.

594
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Moreover, he doesn't know the word Gougou.

595
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Gougou means Gougou.

596
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What?

597
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Gougou means Gougou.

598
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Gougou means

599
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Princess.

600
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Princess?

601
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
This person?

602
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So, Mr. Roliko,

603
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
you have to do this job better.

604
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes.

605
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm sorry.

606
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The boss is so surprised.

607
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I can't stand it.

608
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Mom, I have to go to work.

609
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I have to go.

610
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Can you take her away?

611
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Son, how much money do you need?

612
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The world is the best for the world.

613
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The world is yours.

614
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yunhe, what are you talking about?

615
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Before, Prince Qing gave me a sum of money.

616
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I was the one who gave the country a lot of money.

617
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Prince Qing?

618
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yes.

619
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The money of the Qing Dynasty is more suitable for this time.

620
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
By the way, I have invited more than ten soldiers to your place.

621
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I will be there in a day.

622
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You will be there for me.

623
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Okay, you can do it.

624
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We don't need to be afraid of these Japanese food.

625
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We have to be kind and polite.

626
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
By the time, let the girl in the opposite door

627
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
buy us some fresh meat.

628
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We will eat it.

629
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Okay.

630
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Why is the wife of the opposite door so lively?

631
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Who is she?

632
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
She is so beautiful.

633
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I am asking you.

634
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
How would I know?

635
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't care about that.

636
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Come here.

637
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Come and have a look.

638
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Is the money good?

639
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The money is good.

640
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The chess is good.

641
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It looks good.

642
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The money is good.

643
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Look at the line and the picture.

644
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What's wrong?

645
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You are done?

646
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
What if I draw a picture

647
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
with this one?

648
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The books, the light, the line,

649
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and the color are all money.

650
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The money is not good.

651
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I just draw money.

652
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What's wrong?

653
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You really want to draw money?

654
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What's the most necessary

655
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
for the revolution in China?

656
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The most necessary is money.

657
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I am still missing money.

658
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
People are missing money on the street.

659
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
If you are missing money, you can make fake money.

660
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Shihong, you are so smart.

661
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You think fake money is so easy to make?

662
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You can make it out of it.

663
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Shihong.

664
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I am coming in.

665
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You are done?

666
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Look at this carefully.

667
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Is this a smart drawing?

668
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Listen.

669
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Every country's currency

670
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
is the most smart drawing.

671
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Come here.

672
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Come here.

673
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Look at this.

674
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Look at this picture.

675
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
How many threads should I use to make this picture?

676
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Shihong,

677
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you need to help me find a pen and paper

678
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
on the top.

679
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's not a pen and paper on the top.

680
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
How can you make it out of this?

681
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Especially this picture on the currency.

682
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Do you know why the currency

683
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
is the main pattern of people's picture?

684
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Because the eyes of humans

685
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
are the same.

686
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The most accurate one.

687
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Even the old lady of the seller

688
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
can see the difference in human face on it.

689
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You can't fool her at all.

690
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
This is the ability of human life.

691
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's talk about this portrait.

692
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You said the accurate round of round

693
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
must have tens of thousands threads.

694
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
As long as it is not the top Chinese currency,

695
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
no matter what, you can't make it.

696
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Do you know so many Chinese currencies?

697
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Help me find one.

698
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You don't think about it.

699
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
This is a matter of the world.

700
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Which one of you will make it?

701
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Then you have to see your revolution.

702
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Revolution must have the ability to promote.

703
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If you promote, there will be organizations.

704
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
If you organize, there will be armed actions.

705
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
If you have armed actions,

706
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
you can defeat the power of the Great Qing Dynasty.

707
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Just by promoting revolution

708
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
can people make a fake currency for you?

709
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The national armed revolution

710
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
must be a big profit.

711
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The fake currency is the best way to make money.

712
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
First of all,

713
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
it can take the beauty of the money

714
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and make it mess up the economy.

715
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The Japanese fake currency technology has been lost.

716
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We have found experts in this area

717
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
who are making the model.

718
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Now, we need a fixed supply market.

719
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Stacy

720
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
They aren't sitting there now.

721
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Let's go look in the distance.

722
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,360
That's one of the last moments of my life.

723
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,540
Entry number 1.

724
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,420
So that doesn't mean you have to command events with eight privates.

725
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,780
Sorry I couldn't come on time.

726
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,780
You think your mother drinks tobacco?

727
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,780
Yes.

728
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,780
I couldn't see much of it.

729
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,780
But I think it's better to have a cigarette.

730
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,780
I'll be the one to say it all.

731
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Is that so?

732
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,780
No, no. Money is enough.

733
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,780
I'm taking all the necessary things from Mr. Ayakura.

734
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,780
I'm taking all the necessary things from Mr. Ayakura.

735
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,780
Hey, come in.

736
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,780
What is this?

737
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,780
It's a disease.

738
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,780
It's a good thing about East Asia.

739
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,780
The doctor in East Asia said that he didn't want me to smoke.

740
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,780
He said that he was not good at his health.

741
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,780
I said that you should talk about this when you're old enough to live like me.

742
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
What about your son?

743
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,780
He went to the army.

744
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,780
He said that he was going to be filial in the day after tomorrow.

745
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,780
He doesn't understand.

746
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,780
By the way, girl, help me with something.

747
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,780
I'll cook some fresh meat for you.

748
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,780
Okay.

749
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,780
After you finish your dishes, you can cook some meat.

750
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,780
It's all the people who like it.

751
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,780
People who like it don't need to boil it for long.

752
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,780
They can boil it for a long time.

753
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,780
If you drink it, it's better than using it.

754
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,780
That's what you mean.

755
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Son, you're here.

756
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Let me introduce you to him.

757
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Mother, you don't need to introduce him.

758
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,780
Mom, I have something to do.

759
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,780
No, no, no.

760
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,780
The guests are coming.

761
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
Let's go together.

762
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,780
Mother.

763
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
What's going on?

764
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,780
I've met him on the boat in Japan.

765
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,780
He and Mr. Wu are very concerned about my identity.

766
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,780
No way.

767
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,780
Son, you don't need to lie.

768
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,780
Since he's concerned,

769
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,780
we don't need to make him look like a man with a hot face.

770
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,780
You're not a good person.

771
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,780
Can you be a little more?

772
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,780
What are you talking about?

773
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
You can't even think of a girl.

774
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,780
You're a man.

775
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,780
You have to have the strength to be like the old Tai Han.

776
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,780
Didn't you have the strength to be a good person?

777
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,780
Do you hear me?

778
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,780
Son, come here.

779
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,780
Son, come here.

780
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
Father.

781
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
Father.

782
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
Son.

783
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Coming.

784
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
Jin Niang.

785
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
Good boy.

786
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Good boy.

787
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Don't worry.

788
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,780
My family's son, Xiao Zi,

789
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,780
is called Xiao Zi.

790
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,780
Then I'm the one who's called Xiao Zi.

791
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,780
Go in.

792
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
Hurry up.

793
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Take your time.

794
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,780
Come in.

795
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
Come in.

796
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,780
Come in.

797
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Thank you, Jin Niang.

798
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
Xiao.

799
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Yes.

800
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
It smells so good.

801
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
It smells so good.

802
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,780
What are you doing?

803
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,780
Ask me who I'm asking.

804
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
I'm asking you.

805
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
Father.

806
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Father.

807
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,780
Coming.

808
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,780
It's still not over.

809
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
It's okay.

810
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
Come slowly.

811
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Come slowly.

812
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
Can I go in and have a look?

813
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
Just a little bit.

814
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
You little girl.

815
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,780
I never want to let others disturb me.

816
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,780
It's like real.

817
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,780
Look at the rain.

818
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,780
You're so good.

819
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,780
What's this?

820
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,780
The year Empress Dowager was 60 years old,

821
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,780
the one I received in the palace

822
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,780
was the nine-glazed lotus.

823
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,780
Really?

824
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
It's a big deal.

825
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Your words are like the gift of Empress Dowager.

826
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Nine-glazed lotus.

827
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,780
It took me half a year to make it.

828
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,780
It's so great.

829
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,780
My hands are swollen.

830
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
I can tell.

831
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
You're just a pre-use.

832
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,780
The price of the shop gave me a little bit of money.

833
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,780
It's not even enough to pay the water.

834
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,780
How can I say?

835
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
It's not enough to pay the water.

836
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,780
I have an idea.

837
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
What?

838
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
There's another way.

839
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
If you can't draw,

840
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,780
can you draw?

841
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
It's like a pen.

842
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Draw?

843
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
What kind of person?

844
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
Who?

845
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
The one with this head.

846
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Draw him?

847
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
Such a noble person,

848
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
you're the one who's so noble.

849
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
You can draw him.

850
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,780
It's a good idea.

851
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,780
We don't need to draw in the future.

852
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
Just make money.

853
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
No, it's not like that.

854
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,780
I'll die in this life.

855
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
How many can I draw?

856
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,780
It's not enough to pay my salary.

857
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,780
There's not much to do.

858
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,780
One is enough.

859
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,780
Fine.

860
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Just draw one.

861
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
The whole world will be happy.

862
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,780
We'll be a bank.

863
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
That's a good idea.

864
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
Draw one.

865
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
The whole life will be happy.

866
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
You little girl.

867
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
You're so thoughtful.

868
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,780
You have such a good idea.

869
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,780
You just need to follow the rules.

870
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
Someone will help you with the rest.

871
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,780
Other people don't have such a surprise drawing.

872
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,780
What kind of person are you talking about?

873
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
Have you ever heard of the Revolutionary Party?

874
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,780
The Party?

875
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Revolutionary Party?

876
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,780
That's right.

877
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,780
They asked me to ask you this.

878
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,780
It's a small bill.

879
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,780
The 10 yuan transfer of the Chinese bank.

880
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,780
Is it okay?

881
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,780
Miss.

882
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,780
How old are you?

883
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,780
I'm 19 years old this year.

884
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
You're so young.

885
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,780
You're so good at drawing.

886
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,780
What a pity.

887
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,780
What a pity.

888
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,780
Take this.

889
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,780
I'll give you the revolution.

890
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,780
This...

891
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Take this double-edged painting.

892
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,780
But...

893
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,780
Tell Boss Wan Shan.

894
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,780
I'll never sell the same painting...

895
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,780
as Zhu Wentong.

896
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,780
Take it.

897
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,780
You haven't printed it yet.

898
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,780
I'll print it for you.

899
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
He doesn't draw?

900
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,780
Why are you so honest?

901
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,780
This way, Mr. Lao will be scared to run away.

902
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
He's a little scared.

903
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
Tell him that he'll be scared to run away.

904
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,780
You should be careful.

905
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,780
What's the matter with him?

906
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,780
Don't say that he's scared.

907
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Tell me about the revolution.

908
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
The people's tragedy.

909
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
Where's my document?

910
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
What document?

911
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780
Zou Rongxiong's new work.

912
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Yes, yes, yes.

913
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,780
Here.

914
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,780
I'll read it for you.

915
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
Just a part.

916
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,780
The collection of thousands of different kinds of paper.

917
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,780
Retreat.

918
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,780
The thousands of different kinds of paper.

919
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Work hard.

920
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,780
The rare gold.

921
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,780
260 years of cruel and cruel paper.

922
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,780
It's a big shame.

923
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Don't be so cautious.

924
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,780
You bless your own state,

925
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,780
but your whole family can be taken away from you.

926
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:50,780
From the wild animals Look after the autonauty.

927
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,940
Shi MAbdy Google

928
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,780
I will be honored by you

929
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,780
I will be honored by you

930
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,780
This song is a dream

931
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Leave the light of love

932
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,780
Light up the starry sky

933
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,780
I will be honored by you

934
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,780
I will be honored by you

935
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,780
The light of the sky is bright

936
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,780
The light of the sky is bright

937
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,780
The light of the sky is bright

938
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,780
The light of the sky is bright

939
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,780
I will be honored by you

940
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,780
I will be honored by you

941
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,780
This song is a dream

942
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,780
Leave the light of love

943
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,780
Light up the starry sky

944
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,780
I will be honored by you

945
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,780
The snow is falling

946
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,780
The red light is bright

947
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,780
The light of life is bright

948
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,780
The wind is hard to reach

949
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,780
I will be honored by you

950
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,780
I will be honored by you

951
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,780
This song is a dream

952
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,780
Leave the light of love

953
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,780
Light up the starry sky

954
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,780
I will be honored by you

955
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,780
The snow is falling

956
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,780
The red light is bright

957
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,780
The light of life is bright

958
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,780
The wind is hard to reach

959
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,780
I will be honored by you

960
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,780
This song is a dream

961
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,780
Leave the light of love

962
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,780
Light up the starry sky
