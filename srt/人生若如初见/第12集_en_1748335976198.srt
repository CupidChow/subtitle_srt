Episode 130

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,720
What a huge gift, Liang Xiang.

6
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,800
It was been from you that it was worth introducing.

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,040
You left earlier than anyone.

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,580
What exactly the two of you made me do?

9
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,240
Give me a call.

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,520
This tama is all it takes.

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Hi.

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
What's the matter with you two?

13
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Kaizhi, since your friend is here,

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
you should take some photos.

15
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
It's a good idea.

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Get some vegetables.

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
We haven't arrived yet.

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
We'll get some vegetables when he's here.

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Okay.

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
You're taking photos of others again.

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
You can take a photo of us anytime, okay?

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,520
You're taking photos of Chaoxian's injury.

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
You dare not do anything to me?

24
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,520
You're so mean.

25
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
It's late.

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Let me introduce you to the guy.

28
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
He's my brother, Yang Yifan.

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
He's from Hanhua.

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
He's Miyabi.

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
He's Miyabi.

32
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
I understand.

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Come on.

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Don't be shy.

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm not shy.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
You're Kaizhi's brother.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm the one who's with Tu Bao, right?

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
To be honest,

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
we heard from Kaizhi.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
He said he has a brother named Ju Yuan.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
He's a good man.

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
He's got a lot of people.

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
It's so hard.

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Don't believe that.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Don't believe that.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
What kind of a man is he?

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Haven't you heard of him?

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
He went to the exam hall and got a fart.

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
He also got a fart for the ancestors.

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Listen, Kaizhi.

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
There's a real question.

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
You can't tell if you're curious.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Right?

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Who are you talking about?

55
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Don't think too much about the Chinese scientific system.

56
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
It's not necessary.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
It's okay to make a big fuss.

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
It's better to kick the door for him.

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
It's better to kick the door for him.

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Mr. Yang,

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
do you know much about science?

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Science design is a genius design.

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
The court moves the whole country's culture

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
through science.

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
It's a life-threatening process.

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
It's not a thought.

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
It's a process of many young people's talent

68
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
and experience.

69
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,520
It's a waste of time and effort.

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Brother Yifan,

71
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,520
it's a little bit easy to get to know you.

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Joki,

74
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
what are you talking about?

75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Do you know?

76
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,520
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
You're just a little girl.

78
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Do you know how to talk?

79
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Science design?

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
I saw her crying.

81
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Cheers!

82
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
I'll drink it.

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Cheers!

84
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Cheers!

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Cheers!

86
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Cheers!

87
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Cheers!

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Cheers!

89
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
It's delicious.

90
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
It's delicious.

91
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
It's delicious.

92
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Mr. Yifan,

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
if you dare to go in,

94
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
you can have a rest.

95
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Let's go.

96
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
What are you doing?

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
What are you doing?

98
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
What are you doing?

99
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
What are you doing?

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
What are you doing?

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
What are you doing?

102
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
What are you doing?

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
What are you doing?

104
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,520
I'm a Tokyo detective.

105
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
What are you doing?

106
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
It's strange.

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Why did they arrest us?

108
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Did they arrest you?

109
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Why did they arrest me?

110
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
They found a relationship.

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
They were in a good relationship.

112
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Tu Fang,

113
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
you're a good friend.

114
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Who?

115
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
What do you mean?

116
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
The police can't arrest people without reason.

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
How do you know

118
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
they're innocent?

119
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Mr. Yang,

120
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,520
where do you live in Tokyo?

121
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
You don't know the meaning of it.

122
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
No, no.

123
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Just ask.

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,520
I don't think they're going to arrest me.

125
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Yesterday afternoon,

126
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
I had a tea with

127
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Japanese General.

128
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
You know him?

129
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
I don't know him.

130
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
I met him the first time.

131
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
My friend introduced me to him.

132
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
We talked about

133
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
the current relationship.

134
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Really?

135
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
If they were going to arrest me,

136
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
they should have arrested me yesterday.

137
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
But the problem is,

138
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
what's the use of arresting me?

139
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Sun Wen, Wendun, Meng Na,

140
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
the world is in chaos.

141
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
But before that,

142
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
who else in the world

143
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
knows that there's a person named Sun Wen in China?

144
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
That's true.

145
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Han Hua,

146
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,520
maybe you'll be Sun Wen's second tomorrow.

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
I heard that the Japanese General

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
has a bad personality.

149
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Is that true?

150
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
He has a low personality.

151
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
He looks pure.

152
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
He has a dark skin.

153
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
When he thinks about it,

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
there's no difference between

155
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
a farmer and a farmer.

156
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
But he has a pair of eyes.

157
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Stop.

158
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
When I hear you talk,

159
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
like a eagle,

160
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
I really listen to every word you say.

161
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
You can feel his ambition.

162
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Mr. Yang is very sensitive.

163
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
I've been in Japan for a few years.

164
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
This is also very deep for me.

165
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
So I have to change it.

166
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Liang Xiang,

167
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
with your identity,

168
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
it's not easy to recognize this.

169
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
How do you change the key?

170
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Change from the destiny to the people's will.

171
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm sure you will change it.

172
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Of course, it's for the emperor.

173
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
It's called cultural change and cultural change.

174
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Cultural change is a change.

175
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Cultural change is a revolution.

176
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Mr. Yang,

177
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
is it a change or a revolution?

178
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
What do you think?

179
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
China must be changed.

180
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Revolution will only make China

181
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
from the old past

182
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
to the future.

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
It seems that you are in military school.

184
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm not only in military school.

185
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
In the east,

186
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,520
there are nearly 10,000 Chinese students.

187
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Where can you meet them?

188
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
If you meet them,

189
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
you can't get rid of these topics.

190
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Now, Chinese politics

191
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
is everyone wants to participate.

192
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Everyone thinks he has the ability to participate.

193
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Where is this?

194
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Why are we here?

195
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
You asked me?

196
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
I want to ask you.

197
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Did you do anything illegal?

198
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Are you drunk?

199
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
You are listening to me.

200
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
What's going on here?

201
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Three seconds.

202
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Three seconds.

203
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Listen carefully.

204
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
You all should subscribe here.

205
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
When you are done,

206
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
find each person's confession.

207
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Excuse me.

208
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Why did you do this?

209
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
You want to find the person's confession?

210
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Shut up.

211
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
If you say,

212
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
find it.

213
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
If you say,

214
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
find it.

215
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
You are sure to be a good person.

216
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
That's all for today.

217
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Here you are.

218
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Thank you.

219
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Shuku-ko.

220
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Yes.

221
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Are you being confessed?

222
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
No.

223
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Do you have any evidence?

224
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Do you have any evidence?

225
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,520
It doesn't make any sense.

226
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,520
I just felt some kind of falsification from you.

227
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,520
You are young, but you are smiling.

228
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
What do you mean?

229
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,520
I don't want to talk to you.

230
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
You are late.

231
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Show me your hand.

232
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
What a beautiful hand.

233
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,520
You must have a good body.

234
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,520
The ratio of people's hands is the same as the body.

235
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Is that so?

236
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Yes.

237
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
If you have time,

238
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
let's talk.

239
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,520
I have a very good impression of you.

240
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Bye.

241
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Shuku-ko.

242
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Yes.

243
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Do you have a brother named Yoh Ichihan?

244
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Yes.

245
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I see.

246
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Did you do anything?

247
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,520
A man from the Tokyo Police Department came to see you.

248
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Your brother told you that he was a security guard.

249
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
I see.

250
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
I see.

251
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
I see.

252
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
I see.

253
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
I see.

254
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I see.

255
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
I see.

256
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
I see.

257
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
You are a security guard.

258
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Yes.

259
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
I see.

260
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
I see.

261
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
I see.

262
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
I see.

263
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I see.

264
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Nice to meet you.

265
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
I am a teacher at Shikanga School.

266
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
My name is Hirata.

267
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I am Hirata.

268
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Nice to meet you.

269
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
I am Shuku-ko.

270
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Did you come here as a security guard?

271
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Yes.

272
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I am honored to see you.

273
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Hey, Deli!

274
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Deli.

275
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Let's go.

276
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Brother, what's going on?

277
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
What's the matter with them?

278
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
It's all my brothers.

279
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Your brothers?

280
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
What's wrong with them?

281
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
They are in trouble.

282
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,520
They are too impulsive.

283
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
In trouble?

284
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
They are in trouble?

285
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
A hundred women can't find them.

286
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
They are looking for them.

287
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
They are in trouble.

288
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
In trouble?

289
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
I don't know what they are.

290
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
They are in trouble for 24 hours.

291
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:09,520
How many women have you been with?

292
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
I don't know.

293
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520
I am only Chinese.

294
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Don't come near her again.

295
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Don't think about anything strange.

296
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Got it?

297
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Yes.

298
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
Please understand.

299
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Take a break.

300
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Please understand.

301
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Please understand.

302
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
You two, please leave.

303
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Yes.

304
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Yuan Xian, I know that you have been with them.

305
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
You can explain to me.

306
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Why?

307
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
I am also surprised.

308
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Why do police officers know that

309
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,520
only one Chinese is coming with the women of the imperial court

310
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
but is trying to get her Chinese classmate?

311
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Because at that time,

312
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
there was no uniform.

313
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
And

314
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,520
there was a funny con man.

315
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
They wanted to know who you are

316
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
and what you are doing.

317
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
This is a good reason.

318
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Officer,

319
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
anything else?

320
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,520
You don't want to talk to me?

321
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
I understand.

322
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Moscow.

323
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Yes, sir.

324
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Hello, officer.

325
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Please, take care of me.

326
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Sir,

327
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
what did you say?

328
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
What are you doing?

329
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
I am just asking you.

330
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
I am not asking you.

331
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
I am just asking you.

332
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
What are you doing?

333
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
I am just asking you.

334
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
What are you doing?

335
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
I am just asking you.

336
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
What are you doing?

337
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Take off.

338
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Take off.

339
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Take off.

340
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Give me the gun.

341
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Take off.

342
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Take off.

343
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Take off.

344
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
You think it over?

345
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
You are different from us.

346
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
How is it different?

347
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
What is different?

348
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
You took off the uniform and didn't want to catch you.

349
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Give it to me.

350
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Take off.

351
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Take off.

352
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Listen to me.

353
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I can do it.

354
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
You can't.

355
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
You have to think for your own money.

356
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
I am not asking you.

357
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
You are saying that I am not.

358
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
You are saying that I am not.

359
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I am not saying that I am not.

360
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
I am not.

361
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
What are you doing?

362
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Listen to me.

363
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
He is just a little boy.

364
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
I have been so excited for three days.

365
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
He is a bad guy.

366
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
He is not a bad guy.

367
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
He is not a bad guy.

368
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
I want to teach him a lesson.

369
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
I want to teach him a lesson.

370
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Take off.

371
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,520
The reason why I am a new member of the country is to be a monster.

372
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
A monster is a slave.

373
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
A slave is a thief.

374
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
A thief is a thief.

375
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
A thief is a thief.

376
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,520
They are raising a trap for their country.

377
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,520
They are students of the new country.

378
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,520
They are students of the military and the political system.

379
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,520
They want to be a slave to the Japanese ideology.

380
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,520
If the new president of the future doesn't want to be a slave to Japan,

381
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,520
he will have to be a slave to the Japanese ideology.

382
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
I understand.

383
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Yes.

384
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,520
This is a 100-year plan of the Japanese Empire.

385
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,520
It is also a dream of the people of Yamato.

386
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I want you to understand this mission.

387
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,520
I want you to understand this mission.

388
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,520
I want you to erase your own life and your life.

389
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Don't be fooled by your emotions.

390
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,520
I want you to repeat the evidence of their actions.

391
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,520
This is the plan of the country.

392
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,520
I have been thinking about it.

393
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,520
I have been thinking about it.

394
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Let's go.

395
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Yes.

396
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
You are bald.

397
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I saw it yesterday.

398
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Why?

399
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Even if you are a student of the Japanese ideology.

400
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Li Yijian is very suspicious.

401
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,520
Now he is more serious.

402
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
You are not stressed, are you?

403
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
I am very stressed.

404
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
He has been in the house...

405
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
I don't want to talk about this.

406
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I am very stressed.

407
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
I am very stressed.

408
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
I am very stressed.

409
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
I am very stressed.

410
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I am very stressed.

411
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I am very stressed.

412
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I am very stressed.

413
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I am very stressed.

414
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
I am very stressed.

415
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I am very stressed.

416
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
I am very stressed.

417
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I am very stressed.

418
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
I am very stressed.

419
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
I am very stressed.

420
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,520
I will introduce you to a new friend.

421
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
He is Mr. Li Juki.

422
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Thank you for organizing this.

423
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Don't worry about it.

424
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Mr. Li came from the University of Tokyo.

425
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
It's not convenient for him.

426
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,520
He made them come here.

427
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
What are they?

428
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I don't know.

429
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Mr. Shuku, let's call the principal.

430
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Yes.

431
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Hello.

432
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Hello.

433
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
What is it?

434
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
What is it?

435
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Your friend is coming.

436
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Yes.

437
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Please.

438
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Mr. Li.

439
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Mr. Li.

440
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
You are trying to fool me.

441
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Where do you think you are?

442
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Is it your money-making club?

443
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
No.

444
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Please cut the phone.

445
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
What are you talking about?

446
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,520
What did you do to the school?

447
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,520
The money-making club you gave me was fake.

448
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
Are you fooling me?

449
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Shut up.

450
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Your neck is very stiff.

451
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,520
Your neck and this small one are very stiff.

452
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
It's very hard.

453
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
You are a fool.

454
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
It's me.

455
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Mr. Kawiyama.

456
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
You are so stupid.

457
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Mr. Kawiyama.

458
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
Wait.

459
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Mr. Kawiyama?

460
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,520
You are doing the club?

461
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Yes.

462
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,520
I am Mr. Li.

463
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
I am Mr. Shuku.

464
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,520
I am Mr. Shuku.

465
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Why are you dating in this place?

466
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,520
It's just a lie.

467
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Japanese politics don't have such a luxury.

468
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
You are a fool.

469
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
You are a fool.

470
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
You are a fool.

471
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,520
You are a fool.

472
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
But you are still a fool.

473
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,520
You are a fool.

474
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,520
What are you doing?

475
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,520
What are you doing?

476
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,520
I don't know what you want to do.

477
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,520
If you love art, you can use the painting.

478
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,520
If you want to work with politics,

479
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,520
send your boss who is living in your house.

480
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,520
If you want to take part in the Chinese palace,

481
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,520
the best way is to start a Chinese revolution.

482
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Look at me and help me.

483
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
I just want to say that

484
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,520
my money is worth the revolution.

485
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Yes.

486
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Where did you meet him?

487
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
He?

488
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,520
He is my cousin.

489
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Really?

490
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Really?

491
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Yes.

492
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,520
I will give you a lot of money.

493
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,520
I will give you a lot of money.

494
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Of course.

495
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,520
I will give you a lot of money.

496
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Let's go.

497
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,520
I will give you a lot of money.

498
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,520
I will give you a lot of money.

499
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,520
I will give you a lot of money.

500
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,520
I will give you a lot of money.

501
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,520
What a great man.

502
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,520
You are a painter.

503
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Yes. I am a poor painter.

504
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
You can sit down.

505
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
I am sorry.

506
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,520
You will give me a lot of money.

507
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,520
So I need money.

508
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,520
The quality of the materials is very valuable.

509
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,520
He is like a good woman.

510
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Why didn't I mention Shuhong to you?

511
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Where is he now?

512
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
He is in Dongjing.

513
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
He is...

514
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Then,

515
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
you let him come to me.

516
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
I will be very happy.

517
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,520
My money is in your hands.

518
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I am not worried.

519
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
No.

520
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,520
I don't want him to participate in this.

521
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
It's too dangerous.

522
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
Then,

523
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,520
why should I be in your danger?

524
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,520
You said you would go to the palace of China.

525
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I know.

526
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
But I don't need a family.

527
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I need

528
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,520
the intelligence of the people of the country.

529
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,520
The people of the country are too poor.

530
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,520
The people of the Fengjian team are too poor.

531
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,520
They are too poor.

532
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
The condition is not good.

533
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
The trade is fair.

534
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,520
You may go to the left.

535
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
The people of the country will come to Dongjing to see me.

536
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
They need a check-up.

537
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,520
I will buy the materials.

538
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,520
The guards in the city will be very happy.

539
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Then,

540
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,520
let Shuhong teach me.

541
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
You.

542
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
I?

543
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
I am not too good.

544
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
All.

545
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Mr. Liu Buwanshan.

546
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
I have another question.

547
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
I am curious.

548
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,520
How did you get into this relationship?

549
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Did you have your relatives in the military office?

550
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Well.

551
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,520
I suggest you not to be curious.

552
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
In the face of Dongjing,

553
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,520
the word is suddenly secret.

554
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,520
If you are curious,

555
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
the Japanese security guard

556
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
will come to knock on the door.

557
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Be careful, Mr. Wu.

558
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Don't give the money to the people of the country.

559
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Don't let the people of the country get into trouble.

560
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,520
It has been two hours.

561
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Answer me.

562
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Where did you go?

563
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Excuse me.

564
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Excuse me.

565
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Excuse me.

566
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
What do you want?

567
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Do you have a desk?

568
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
What about your relationship?

569
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I am a teacher at the school.

570
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Teacher?

571
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Yes, teacher.

572
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
I am sorry, but

573
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
I have refused to attend

574
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
all the school's new classes

575
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,520
since 9 p.m.

576
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Why are you quiet?

577
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Nothing good.

578
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,520
I am not a strict person.

579
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
Mr. Shuku.

580
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,520
I can't fool you.

581
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,520
There was a police officer earlier.

582
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,520
I was a little nervous.

583
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,520
I was a little nervous.

584
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,520
There was a police officer earlier.

585
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
By the way,

586
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,520
the police officer is a special person.

587
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,520
I have no other choice

588
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,520
than to take you to the university.

589
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,520
I will return your tuition.

590
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,520
We are short-term relationships,

591
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,520
but I am evaluating you.

592
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,520
I am not calling you by your name.

593
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Teacher.

594
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Let's go to university tonight.

595
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,520
That man is waiting for you at the gate.

596
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
What's wrong?

597
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,520
I have quit my studies.

598
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
You have really quit your studies?

599
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I have quit my studies.

600
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
You should have said that

601
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
you are a brother-in-law.

602
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,520
You should have said that

603
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,520
you are a brother-in-law.

604
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,520
What a good girl.

605
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
You are back from your studies?

606
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,520
I have just got a investment.

607
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Really?

608
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Let's practice.

609
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
What do you think about the couple?

610
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Can you be separated?

611
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
I can't.

612
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Let me run for you.

613
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
I will protect you.

614
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
I will be your friend.

615
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
You know how to run.

616
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
You are the boss.

617
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
You are a fireman.

618
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Who are you talking to?

619
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Your ex-lady, Mr. Wanshan.

620
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,520
Mr. Wanshan?

621
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
He is a Japanese black bag.

622
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
What can you do?

623
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,520
I can't let you go.

624
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
You are a Japanese.

625
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Where do I sleep?

626
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Anywhere.

627
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
Anywhere?

628
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,520
You can sleep anywhere.

629
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Why are you looking at me like that?

630
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
I am more dangerous than a bomb.

631
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
This is not where you sleep.

632
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,520
You didn't go back to see

633
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,520
the boss of the hotel.

634
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Why did I look for him?

635
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
You think I don't know?

636
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,520
I knew it.

637
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,520
I have seen you before.

638
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
It's good to be here.

639
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
What are you looking at?

640
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
I don't even know how to talk to you.

641
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
A man who does business.

642
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
He is a man of honor.

643
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
How can he not be a man of honor?

644
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Bring the box over here.

645
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
It says Mr. Wanshan.

646
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Yes?

647
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Three of them are in the prison.

648
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
As for Mr. Yama,

649
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
do not worry about what we expect.

650
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Thank you.

651
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
The guys from squeeze materials

652
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
are trying to appoint an entire era

653
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
to the nuclear 셋.

654
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
We were held in this family

655
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
celebrating with one attitude.

656
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
She immediately agreed.

657
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
I'm the one who's against it.

658
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Yes.

659
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
If I say I'll give you money, you'll give it.

660
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,520
If you say you'll kill someone, I won't live.

661
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Yes.

662
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
Yes, sir.

663
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,520
Master, the Chinese are here.

664
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Return to Shanghai.

665
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Tell them what I said.

666
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,520
When you have a report, come to the public.

667
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
Write it down.

668
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,520
The wind is clear, the life is smooth.

669
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Everything is in order.

670
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
That's all.

671
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Yes, sir.

672
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Go.

673
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Shuo Hong.

674
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Do you want to sell your school?

675
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
It's beautiful.

676
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
The shop is beautiful.

677
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
Where did you go?

678
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,520
My brother-in-law told me to go to Xia Tian Gezi's school.

679
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
I studied for a while.

680
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Xia Tian Gezi?

681
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
What a poor man.

682
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
He's the only one who's rich.

683
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Is the shop still good?

684
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Not good.

685
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
It's light.

686
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,520
You're leaving, and the flowers are not good to sell.

687
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Mr. Wu asked me to bring it to you.

688
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
That's it, Shuo Hong.

689
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,520
It seems that Mr. Wu chose a place

690
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,520
that is not good.

691
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
The shop is under construction.

692
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
The shop is under construction.

693
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,520
He can consider moving the shop.

694
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Can the people agree?

695
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,520
The business is good under the building.

696
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I will agree.

697
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
The shop is under construction?

698
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
No, no, no.

699
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
The local shop is under construction.

700
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
You're going to sell it for me?

701
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
What do you think?

702
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,520
It's convenient to use.

703
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Isn't it?

704
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,520
I can sign a agreement with you now.

705
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
This one.

706
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
