1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
ðŸŽµ

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,340
naming the

3
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,300
one

4
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Come on!

5
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,300
Come on!

6
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,300
Come on!

7
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
Come on!

8
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Give me the gun!

9
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,300
Yuan Xian, you're here.

10
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Someone told me to come here.

11
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
I...

12
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm Tong Jitan.

13
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Give me the score and I'll come here.

14
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
I'll go there and shoot at the tofu.

15
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
I...

16
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
Yes, the score is 17.

17
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,300
I've prepared the clothes for you.

18
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Go!

19
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Yes!

20
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,940
Mother Folk!

21
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,800
Why aren't you looking at me?

22
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
A little bit.

23
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,300
The other child is Yang Yubin.

24
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:02,300
Miss Chao Zongwe, I need you.

25
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,900
I said I'll do it.

26
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,500
You're crazy.

27
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,500
I want to hear your thoughts on the tank.

28
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
I guessed it.

29
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
That's a model of a magnet.

30
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
It's a physical project,

31
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
but it's military project.

32
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
It's a moral training for the police.

33
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
It sounds very fresh.

34
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I think it's...

35
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
the traditional Chinese soldier

36
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
who has no personality

37
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
that is too hard to stand.

38
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,500
He has no determination to fight.

39
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
He only has to overcome.

40
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
He has to overcome.

41
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
He has to overcome.

42
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
He has to overcome.

43
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
He has to overcome.

44
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
He only has to overcome.

45
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
According to the study of the Ru family,

46
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,500
he has to overcome with his soldiers.

47
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
So,

48
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,500
the most ideal soldier in China

49
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
is Lu Jian.

50
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Is that true?

51
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Listen to my first answer.

52
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
The Japanese war has proved

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
that the so-called Ru family

54
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
is useless.

55
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
From now on,

56
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I will teach Japanese swordsmanship to you.

57
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
In the swordmanship,

58
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
you can understand

59
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
the spirit of our Japanese people

60
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
and the way of life.

61
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Tu Fang.

62
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Tu Fang.

63
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Where did you go tonight?

64
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I didn't see you tonight.

65
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Zhang Lezhang.

66
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
The soldier of the military.

67
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
That's good.

68
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
You went to the military.

69
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
You think it's delicious?

70
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Tomorrow is the new day.

71
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I will take you to Dongjing Diguo University.

72
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Turn around.

73
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Dongjing Diguo University?

74
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Where are you going?

75
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
There are some interesting people there.

76
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
They want to know you.

77
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Why are you going with them?

78
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
I don't care about you.

79
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Li Jianli is his master of the Bikou Garden.

80
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
He is the master of the Bikou Garden.

81
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
He is his master of the Bikou Garden.

82
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
I tell you.

83
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
There are not only six students in the country,

84
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
but also one of them,

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Miss Fu Jia from Chao Xianguo.

86
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Miss Fu Jia from Chao Xianguo?

87
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Of course.

88
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,500
There are also some students from Liuyue.

89
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
I will go there.

90
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I have to go to get flowers in the afternoon.

91
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Then go there.

92
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Don't forget.

93
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Kaizhi.

94
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Tell me.

95
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
How did you get into the city?

96
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
You almost got caught.

97
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
You know that?

98
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Yes. I want to eat.

99
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Actually, I have nothing different from now.

100
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I also have a hearing here.

101
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I have a meeting there.

102
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Really?

103
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
At that time, I was studying in Wuchang.

104
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Wuchang University of Zixiang.

105
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Zixiang University is a unique school in Hu Guang.

106
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,500
At first, Zhang Zhidong and Tang Caichang are close.

107
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
They often come to me.

108
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
It's the Zili Jun from Weixing Sect.

109
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
The Zili Jun from Tang Caichang.

110
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Yes. It's him.

111
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
He often comes to our school to teach us.

112
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,500
There is no one who doesn't admire the students of Zixiang University.

113
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
We don't know.

114
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Zhang Zhidong suddenly changed.

115
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
He is a Zili Jun from Tang Caichang.

116
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
He is not a Zili Jun from Tang Caichang.

117
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
He doesn't even let me go to school.

118
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
He is just going to the execution ground.

119
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
It's that simple?

120
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Yes.

121
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
There are tens of thousands of reasons for killing.

122
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
The reason for your attitude towards the Revolutionary Party.

123
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
It's one of them.

124
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Do you believe in revolution?

125
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
How can I say?

126
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,500
What is the nationality we are facing now?

127
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
China has already lost its power to rule.

128
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
How can they restore this power?

129
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Different people have different rules.

130
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Some people change their rules.

131
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Some people close their doors.

132
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Actually, it's natural.

133
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Do you think so?

134
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
You have to open a door.

135
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
You have ten thousand keys in your hand.

136
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
You are a man.

137
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
You are a master.

138
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
You are not in a hurry.

139
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Let me tell you.

140
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
What should I use?

141
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Open the door.

142
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
To be honest,

143
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I am here to introduce you to Liang Shizhi.

144
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Introduce Liang Shizhi for me?

145
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
No.

146
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
You are not the one who introduced me to the court.

147
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
You are the one who introduced me to the court.

148
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
The Japanese ancestors

149
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
ate and drank everything.

150
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,500
They came to Japan from the sea.

151
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
They can even develop themselves.

152
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
They also imported

153
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Chinese,

154
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Indian,

155
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
and all kinds of material and spiritual civilization.

156
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
They also collected and collected.

157
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
They chose a special type

158
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
and completed the organization of the country.

159
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
They used this power

160
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
as the foundation

161
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,500
to win the world's grand prize.

162
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
They accepted the scientific civilization

163
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
from the west

164
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
and created today's power.

165
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Miss Zhao Jianxia.

166
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
I am not here yet.

167
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
As Sun Wen said,

168
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
a nation has to be based on confidence

169
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
and development.

170
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
It is very important

171
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
to have a strong sense of Japanese.

172
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
It is more important to China.

173
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
If the Chinese people can't die,

174
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
they can't beg for life.

175
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
If they want to beg for life,

176
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
they must dare to die.

177
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
The people dare to die.

178
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Under the current situation of world culture,

179
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
they must become a conscious people's power.

180
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Without such a people's power,

181
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
they can't have a strong sense of Japanese.

182
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Good.

183
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Good.

184
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
They are very good.

185
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
What is it?

186
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Who is that?

187
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
He is Liang Xiao.

188
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
He is the leader of the Chinese society.

189
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
After that.

190
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Liang Xiao.

191
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Liang Xiao.

192
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
You are so boring.

193
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Liang Xiao.

194
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
You are not here.

195
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
They are discussing the academic program.

196
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
You are not here.

197
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I only saw a bunch of foreigners.

198
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I didn't see the Miss of Chao Jianbo you said.

199
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I didn't lie to you.

200
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
The Miss of Chao Jianbo

201
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
doesn't live in the school.

202
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
She usually comes a little late.

203
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Go to her Miss of Chao Jianbo.

204
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
You stay here.

205
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
You know her.

206
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Hello.

207
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Hello.

208
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Hello.

209
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Hello.

210
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Hello.

211
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Hello.

212
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Hello.

213
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Hello.

214
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Hello.

215
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
What you said is a middle-aged man.

216
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Yes.

217
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Teacher.

218
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm afraid he will be very upset.

219
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
That means

220
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
he is still in the middle of the school.

221
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Forget it, teacher.

222
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
You have a student like me.

223
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
That's enough.

224
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
No, no, no.

225
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
He should continue his work.

226
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
He is very sensitive and afraid.

227
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
In the past years,

228
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
people saw that others were afraid of chaos

229
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
and they were very much in hiding.

230
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Why?

231
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Because they didn't believe them.

232
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Later,

233
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Liu Xiu was also annoyed.

234
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Liu Xiu was a noble family.

235
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
He took a big turn and went to war.

236
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
People were worried.

237
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
People were worried.

238
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Look,

239
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Liu Xiu,

240
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
who has a lot of family,

241
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
has stood up and talked.

242
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
It seems that he is reliable.

243
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
You have to understand.

244
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
If you can promote a middle-aged man

245
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
to participate in the revolution,

246
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
that will be very valuable.

247
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Dad.

248
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Dad.

249
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Dad.

250
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Where were you?

251
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I was a little disappointed.

252
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I forgot to bring the bamboo house yesterday.

253
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Who put on the scar?

254
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
I told you to clean it up.

255
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
You can't just do it.

256
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Don't you think it's very beautiful?

257
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Kelesa, Kelesa.

258
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
What do you think?

259
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Who is the rich lady?

260
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
What did you say?

261
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
The best.

262
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I'm very happy.

263
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
I'm talking to you.

264
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
I'll talk to you later.

265
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Let's go.

266
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
I think I know.

267
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I'll tell you later.

268
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Kai Zhi is coming.

269
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Kai Zhi, come and sit.

270
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Kai Zhi,

271
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
I saw a carriage from the Liangxiang Pavilion

272
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
that took the carriage away.

273
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
You said that the Japanese

274
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
will really be so close to the Qing Dynasty.

275
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Do you really want to help the Qing Dynasty?

276
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I think Huang Shulang has been a good example.

277
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
You're right, Kai Zhi.

278
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
You have to persuade him to stand up for revolution.

279
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
I heard from the comrades of the Liji Society just now.

280
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
They think

281
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
the Japanese want to cultivate the Qing Dynasty

282
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
and become the same as them.

283
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
In the future, if the Liangxiang people

284
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
really become the ancient property of the Qing Dynasty,

285
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
won't China have to support the Japanese?

286
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
What's wrong with that?

287
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
If that's the case,

288
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
we must expose the Japanese to the surface of the mountains.

289
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
It's not just Liangxiang.

290
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
We must make more people know

291
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
that the Japanese are very ambitious.

292
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Everyone in Japan knows that.

293
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
That's why we must protect the Japanese.

294
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I suggest that you students

295
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
can create a revolution to see

296
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
the first and foremost,

297
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
to show the revolution and to unite the ideas.

298
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
That's good.

299
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Kai Zhi's idea is good.

300
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I can send our students to the dormitory.

301
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
They've been in the Japanese for a long time.

302
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
We can also go to the dormitory.

303
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
We can.

304
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
We can.

305
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
The relevant students are all government officials.

306
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
I have a problem.

307
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
The dogs and the board are hard to brush.

308
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
You must clean up.

309
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
If the funding is insufficient,

310
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
I'll pay the first aid fund.

311
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
We'll figure out a way together

312
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
to make a revolution.

313
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Don't worry, Kai Zhi.

314
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
We'll take care of it.

315
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
We'll take care of it.

316
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Don't worry, Kai Zhi.

317
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Everything will be fine.

318
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Our mission is to be promoted

319
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
and make a good investment.

320
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Okay.

321
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
That's all.

322
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
You're saying something bad?

323
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Okay, I still can't.

324
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I'm just a small-minded person.

325
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I can't even breathe.

326
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Except for the financial issue,

327
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I'm afraid no one can do it.

328
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
You like it?

329
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I have a strong will.

330
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Mr. Cai also said so.

331
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Mr. Cai.

332
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Mr. Cai, you have to thank him.

333
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
He's the one who can't even draw a pen.

334
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Boss, Mr. Wan Shan.

335
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
You've done a good job.

336
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
You're so happy.

337
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Why don't you praise me

338
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
for wearing your shoes?

339
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
You're going to add a letter again, aren't you?

340
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
You should add a letter.

341
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
I'm going to go.

342
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
I can't go without a letter.

343
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I'll think about it.

344
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Excuse me.

345
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Lin Xin.

346
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Look.

347
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm the one who taught you to draw.

348
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,500
You're so good at drawing.

349
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
You're a salesman.

350
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
You're a salesman?

351
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Do you know each other?

352
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I don't know each other.

353
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Just a drawing.

354
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Okay.

355
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I'll take it.

356
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I'll take it.

357
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Is it 1700 yen?

358
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Yes, 1700.

359
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Thank you.

360
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Thank you.

361
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Go and get a job.

362
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
You're from the Japanese family.

363
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
You should look at him.

364
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You're so precious.

365
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
You can't be so casual.

366
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Why are you so stupid?

367
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
What else can I do?

368
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
He's just like me.

369
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I didn't say that.

370
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
You're not used to being a stranger.

371
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
You're just like a paper.

372
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Who are you?

373
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Why are you talking like that?

374
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Don't talk like that.

375
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I'm not buying it.

376
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
If he talks like that,

377
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I'll stop buying it.

378
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
If you don't buy it,

379
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
you'll be in trouble.

380
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Okay.

381
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm not buying it.

382
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
What happened?

383
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I'm a foreigner.

384
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I don't know how to speak Japanese.

385
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm a foreigner.

386
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I'm a foreigner.

387
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
I'm a foreigner.

388
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
I'm a foreigner.

389
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm a foreigner.

390
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
I'm a foreigner.

391
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Hey, hey, hey.

392
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Call the car.

393
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
I'm not going to walk around like this.

394
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Okay.

395
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
See you.

396
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
See you.

397
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
You're so proud.

398
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
You want to hit me?

399
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
No. You're really a fireman.

400
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
What's wrong with a fireman?

401
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
He's stronger than you in Japan.

402
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
If you don't do that,

403
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
you'll be in trouble.

404
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
You're stupid.

405
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Japanese

406
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
even do business in Japan?

407
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Not at all.

408
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Boss Wangshan is so smart.

409
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
He's a Japanese.

410
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Mr. Cai took out all the food and milk.

411
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
He only bought half of it.

412
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
He's selling it.

413
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Oh, Tian Huang.

414
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Japanese believe in Tian.

415
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
If he doesn't believe in Tian,

416
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
then there will be chaos.

417
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
You mean

418
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I?

419
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Look.

420
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
You're so loyal to our family.

421
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
You don't believe me.

422
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Since you've paid the bill,

423
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm so angry.

424
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Mr. Liang,

425
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
I'll help you put up the painting.

426
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Do you still remember my name?

427
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
You can't forget it now.

428
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
You're still a foreigner.

429
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
You can't forget it now.

430
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
You're my client.

431
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
If you want to buy painting,

432
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
you can ask me.

433
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I'll give you a meeting.

434
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I'll go.

435
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Are you worried?

436
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
No.

437
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
I sold the painting.

438
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Do you know who bought it?

439
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
You can't imagine it.

440
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
The one who killed him.

441
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
The one who killed Jun Shisheng?

442
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
He's always so rich.

443
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
You said it was Japanese.

444
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
I've parked the car.

445
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
You can't even get on the car.

446
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
What?

447
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
You're so stupid.

448
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
You can't even get on the car.

449
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
You don't even get on the car.

450
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
You're waiting for me to serve you?

451
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Shoukou,

452
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
you asked him to come and sit.

453
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Who?

454
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
The one who killed Jun Shisheng.

455
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
What?

456
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
He's rich. He wants to get married?

457
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I've discussed with Tianxiang.

458
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
We need to fight for all the Japanese soldiers.

459
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
We need to fight for the revolution.

460
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
You're so good-looking.

461
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
You're so good-looking.

462
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Our defense is in the middle of the revolution.

463
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
We need to take the second law.

464
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
The second law doesn't need

465
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
the military talents.

466
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
You can ask him to come.

467
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
I'll do my job well.

468
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
I think you'll like it

469
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
when your father comes back soon.

470
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
I'm Shoukou Yuushou.

471
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Why are you suddenly talking to him?

472
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
I've heard about you.

473
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
He's a strange person.

474
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
What do you want to do?

475
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
What do you want?

476
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
I don't know about him.

477
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I haven't decided yet.

478
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
I don't want to be in this world.

479
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
I want you to stop.

480
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
I don't want you to stop.

481
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
I don't want you to stop.

482
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
That's not what I want.

483
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
I don't want to be in this world.

484
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Are you afraid of him?

485
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I don't want to be in this world.

486
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
I'm a teacher.

487
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
I'm a teacher.

488
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Please don't talk to me about this.

489
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
You're really...

490
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Chun-Chen Junzi.

491
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
No, no.

492
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
I'm not that scared.

493
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Junzi.

494
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
In Chinese...

495
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Junzi Tang Dang Dang.

496
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Xiao Ren Chang Qi Qi.

497
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Junzi Yu Yi Yi.

498
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Xiao Ren Yu Yi Li.

499
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Junzi Bu Liao Ren.

500
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Jiumei.

501
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Right?

502
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
I'm Chinese.

503
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I'm Chinese.

504
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Are you studying Chinese?

505
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Are you studying Chinese?

506
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
My father likes Chinese culture.

507
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
My daughter...

508
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
is also...

509
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Chun-Chen Junzi.

510
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Hello, Miss.

511
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I still have a request.

512
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Why can you change it?

513
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Mother.

514
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Miss Ryoukyo.

515
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Please tell your husband.

516
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
He's really in a hurry.

517
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Idiot.

518
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
You're back.

519
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Mother.

520
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
If it was only Mr. Ichiro Hira,

521
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
I would have told him that I'm his friend.

522
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
I would have told him that I'm his friend.

523
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Yes.

524
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Yoshiko.

525
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
You don't hate that hairpin of Mr. Ryoukyo.

526
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I don't.

527
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
I hate it.

528
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I hate it.

529
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Why do you treat a man like a woman?

530
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Mother.

531
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I don't think he's too smart.

532
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
But...

533
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
you don't feel that in this house, do you?

534
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I'm really sorry.

535
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
I feel sorry for you.

536
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
It's okay.

537
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
I'll find you some food.

538
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Okay, bye.

539
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Bye.

540
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Bye.

541
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Bye.

542
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Hi, Mr. Yoshiko.

543
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
What is it?

544
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
I have a question.

545
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Tell me.

546
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
The same is true.

547
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Why did you use Mark's ultimate weapon?

548
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
and the Chinese military only teaches dog-head

549
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
What else?

550
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Of course, for example, the Chinese military only teaches horse-touching

551
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
but not the defense of the cavalry

552
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Shikuan Shen Liang Xiang

553
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Yes

554
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I think my future father-in-law

555
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
has already told you

556
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,500
that there is no explanation in the Japanese army

557
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
But your future father-in-law's daughter

558
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
she is not sure to marry you

559
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Shikuan is a good girl

560
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Yes

561
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Shikuan is a good girl

562
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
How long will you be in the military?

563
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Yes

564
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
You little kid

565
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
What's going on?

566
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
What's wrong with him?

567
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Why did he say that he is a father-in-law?

568
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
He is going to divorce you, right?

569
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
What did I tell him?

570
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Father-in-law

571
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
You said father-in-law

572
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Who is he?

573
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Bai Yi Qiu

574
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Look at my mouth

575
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Shikuan Shen Liang Xiang

576
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Do you know?

577
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,500
If you have heard of such a long-term revenge

578
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
you need to be in the Japanese army's military

579
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Are you listening?

580
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
But I think he is a cloth

581
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
He is making a big move

582
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,500
I don't want to be the head of the Japanese army

583
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
So you are the teacher?

584
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
It's not easy to be a teacher

585
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
First of all, you students

586
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
You have to be our teacher

587
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,500
So you will be a good teacher

588
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
You can't be just a servant

589
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
It doesn't make any sense

590
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Come on

591
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Come on

592
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
What's wrong with you?

593
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
You are so slow

594
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
If you allow me to be a good teacher

595
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
I will be even better

596
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
You are a good teacher

597
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
You are a good teacher

598
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
You are a good teacher

599
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Since you are a good teacher

600
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
you are a good teacher

601
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
You are a good teacher

602
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
You are a good teacher

603
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
You are a good teacher

604
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Can you see it?

605
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Your life is in my hands

606
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
I am holding it

607
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
That's right

608
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
You are right

609
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
You are right

610
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
I am very grateful to you

611
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I am very grateful to you

612
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
I am very grateful to you

613
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Liang Xiang

614
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
I want to say this

615
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Don't be far away

616
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Far away

617
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
It's the power of the weak

618
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
And the rules of the world

619
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Are determined by the strong

620
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Without a strong one

621
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Will give all of their life to others

622
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Our army

623
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Is not so childish

624
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Do you understand?

625
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
You are right

626
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
You are right

627
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
You are right

628
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Do you understand what I am saying?

629
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Even if I don't know what you are saying

630
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
But I know what you are saying

631
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Who calls you a teacher?

632
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
I am sorry

633
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
I am sorry

634
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
I will learn to speak with him

635
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
I will use 50 knives

636
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Not a weapon

637
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,500
I will shoot him in the morning

638
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,420
My teacher

639
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,300
So funny

640
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
So for those who didn't erstrilevel

641
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
So you help and I don't know what you are talking about

642
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
What's going on?

643
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
What's wrong?

644
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
What's wrong?

645
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Did they get cold?

646
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Yes, they shouldn't be so different.

647
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
How about we find the chief of the high school?

648
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Yes.

649
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
What's wrong?

650
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Tu Fang, you're talking.

651
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I don't agree with this.

652
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
This...

653
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Come here.

654
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
What's wrong?

655
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Go and talk to him.

656
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Get up and drink some water.

657
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Come on.

658
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
What's wrong?

659
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
I don't know what to do.

660
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
But I know I can't do that.

661
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Which one?

662
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Which one?

663
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Please.

664
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
Barclays.

665
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
This may be possible in East China's University.

666
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
But I'm absolutely sorry for the military.

667
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Not so much.

668
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
There's another way.

669
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
He doesn't want to teach.

670
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
He teaches in vain.

671
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
There's only one way.

672
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
He wants to teach.

673
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
You have to learn well.

674
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
You have to be better than him.

675
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Wait.

676
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,500
The military will be out sooner or later.

677
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Why are you standing there?

678
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
You're going back to school?

679
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Yes, I'm not going back.

680
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
I'm going back to school.

681
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Let's go.

682
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
How is it?

683
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
It's so good.

684
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Eat more if you like.

685
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Anyway, my son won't come back today.

686
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
He's going to bring something to the name.

687
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
It's not the taste.

688
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Eat.

689
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Try this.

690
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Try this.

691
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Come on, try it.

692
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Take it with your hands.

693
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,500
I haven't had such a delicious Chinese meal in a long time.

694
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Your son is so lucky to have such a good son.

695
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
He's a good son.

696
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
He's been a big boy since he was a kid.

697
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500
He has so many things to do.

698
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Girl, I forgot to ask you.

699
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Where did you come from?

700
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,500
I came from my family.

701
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
I came from Anqing.

702
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Anqing?

703
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Yes.

704
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
It's just in Xiajiang.

705
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
What does your parents do?

706
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
They open a shop in our family.

707
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
They make steamed buns,

708
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
they cook and feed them.

709
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
They cook and eat them.

710
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
They promote them.

711
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
It's related to writing and painting.

712
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
They're from the same school.

713
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Why did you come here?

714
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Mom,

715
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
I don't want to talk about it.

716
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
I can't make it clear.

717
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
You can't make it clear?

718
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Mr. Wu looks at you.

719
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
It's not normal.

720
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
It's not difficult.

721
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
You can't make it clear.

722
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
We can make it clear.

723
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
It's true.

724
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
My son grew up in Qiying.

725
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
How could you think

726
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
that he came to the East?

727
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
No one can think of me.

728
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Your son is different.

729
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
He's a pro-summer.

730
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
He's a general.

731
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
What general?

732
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
He's good at raising himself.

733
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Mom,

734
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
the steamed buns are delicious.

735
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
It's so low-key.

736
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
You're the same as my son.

737
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
He loves to eat.

738
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
He's so greedy.

739
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
I can understand now.

740
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
As long as he's a soldier,

741
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
he's not greedy.

742
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
As long as he's a soldier,

743
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
he can be hungry when he's free.

744
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
He can eat when he has time.

745
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Really?

746
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
My son told me that

747
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
he wanted to eat

748
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
something when he was training.

749
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Do you know that?

750
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
He wanted to eat something.

751
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
He wanted to eat

752
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
the little thing.

753
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
He thought of so many things.

754
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
The thing?

755
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
The smile.

756
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,500
It's so nice to have a baby.

757
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500
It's so nice to have a baby.

758
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,500
It's so nice to have a baby.

759
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Is it nice?

760
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Yes.

761
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Mr. Wu told you to eat.

762
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Mom, I...

763
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Go ahead.

764
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Girl,

765
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
try this for Mr. Wu.

766
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
Let him try it.

767
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
This one.

768
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Then,

769
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
take the dumplings.

770
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Okay.

771
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
Thank you, Mom.

772
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Song Gong.

773
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Song Gong.

774
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Song Gong.

775
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Song Gong.

776
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
What's the matter,

777
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Baren?

778
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Try this.

779
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Isn't this a real circle?

780
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Song Gong.

781
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Song Gong.

782
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
You're right.

783
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
It's a fake.

784
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Fake?

785
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
This morning,

786
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
the fire in the front hall

787
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
took 11 of them

788
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
and put them on the table

789
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
to get the money.

790
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Fortunately,

791
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Jing Shou's old friend

792
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
was in the wrong.

793
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
After the check,

794
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
it was a fake.

795
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
At that time,

796
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
the real circle was so big.

797
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
This is not the worst.

798
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
The matter of the morning,

799
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
the afternoon,

800
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
the morning,

801
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
all the money

802
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
were all known.

803
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,500
The people were in a mess.

804
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
But they took all the money

805
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
from the bank.

806
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
They wanted to get the money.

807
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Then,

808
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
the new department

809
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
is closed now.

810
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
How could this happen?

811
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Do you know what's going on?

812
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
President Sheng is in Beijing.

813
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I don't know about this.

814
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
I'm here to see you.

815
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
Send a telegram immediately.

816
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Tell the police.

817
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
This is a small case.

818
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
We can't control it.

819
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
We don't want to see the result.

820
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
I'll send you there.

821
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Bao Quan.

822
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Bao Quan.

823
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
I have to go.

824
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
What's the matter?

825
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I just came back from the public office.

826
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
You know what?

827
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
The bank's bank

828
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
was cheated by someone.

829
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
It's just a 11-point paper.

830
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
No.

831
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
The 10-point paper was cheated.

832
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
At night,

833
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
the 5-point paper was cheated.

834
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
The 5-point paper was also cheated.

835
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,500
How could you say that?

836
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
The chef of the fish family, Ding.

837
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
He's the one who burned the lamb.

838
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,500
I know.

839
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,500
Tell me.

840
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Ding took a 5-point paper

841
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
to seal the bank's exchange cash.

842
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
No.

843
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
The bank didn't give him the cash.

844
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
He even took the money.

845
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
He even covered the price.

846
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
He was so stubborn.

847
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Ding asked me to show you this.

848
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
You're the chairman of the bank.

849
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
He asked you to give him the cash.

850
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Mother.

851
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Mother is in trouble.

852
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
I'm sorry.

853
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,500
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,500
I'm sorry.

856
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,500
I'm sorry.
