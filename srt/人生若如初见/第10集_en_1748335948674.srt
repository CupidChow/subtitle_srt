00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:52,760
Chow canry go

5
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Come on! Come on!

6
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Don't rush! Don't rush!

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,760
You can do it! You can do it!

8
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Twenty people! Twenty people! Come on in!

9
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Come on!

10
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Slow down! Slow down!

11
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Don't be too good! Don't be too bad!

12
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Mr. Song!

13
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Let's talk.

14
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
How about we pay the bank's fees to the bank?

15
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Mr. Song, the board of directors is in Beijing.

16
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
How is it?

17
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,760
The board of directors has already met with Huifeng, Huaqi and other European and American banks.

18
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,760
They are very helpful and open to the public.

19
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,760
The board also said that all the clients should be in line.

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,760
If the clients are not in line, they can meet with the European and American banks.

21
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,760
It's better to have a choice.

22
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Open the door! Open the door!

23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Yes, sir!

24
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Are you okay?

25
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
I'm fine.

26
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm fine.

27
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Hurry! Hurry!

28
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Hurry!

29
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Hurry! Hurry!

30
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Hurry!

31
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Hurry!

32
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,760
Hurry!

33
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Are you Gao Shan?

34
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Yes.

35
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,760
You are the most beautiful, Mr. Kaung.

36
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Well, please sit down.

37
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
The money is gone.

38
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,760
This is a great place.

39
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,760
The building is still in the way.

40
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Mr. Kaung, you are beautiful.

41
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm actually a technical worker.

42
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
You are right, Mr. Kaung.

43
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Mr. Kaung, you are the best.

44
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
You are the most beautiful, Mr. Kaung.

45
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm impressed.

46
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
You are great, Mr. Kaung.

47
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
You are right.

48
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
I'm not lying.

49
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,760
You are the best for us.

50
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,760
You are the best for us.

51
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Mr. Kaung, that's a misunderstanding.

52
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Money is something that can be used to make money.

53
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,760
We, as the investors of the funds,

54
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,760
don't have to think about the risk of theft.

55
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,760
First, I'll try to get some money.

56
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,760
I'm not sure if you understand.

57
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I see.

58
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,760
We have to deal with everything at once.

59
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,760
We have to get the money.

60
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
I'm happy.

61
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Mr. Kaung, you are the best.

62
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
You are the best.

63
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Good morning, Mr. Wan Shan.

64
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Wait a minute, Su Hong.

65
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Good morning, Mr. Wan Shan.

66
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
What is it?

67
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,760
The shop's shop is still open?

68
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Yes, boss.

69
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Mr. Shao Shan's drawing was just received yesterday.

70
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Mr. Cai Guangqi agreed to give us the drawing.

71
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Mr. Fan Zhuo's water will be out in three days.

72
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Don't worry.

73
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Yes.

74
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
You have a boyfriend?

75
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
You have always had one.

76
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
What are you talking about?

77
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
You are still hiding things.

78
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
I don't know.

79
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Shuo Hong.

80
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
I'm sorry.

81
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm sorry.

85
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,760
I only got in this morning.

89
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
So,

90
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
you and Mr. Wu

91
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
are the only two of us.

92
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
How do you know, boss?

93
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
This is

95
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
the only reason

96
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
that I let him go.

97
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Why?

98
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
He will tell you why.

99
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
What?

100
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
That bastard is your boss.

101
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Why are you saying that?

102
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
That's all.

103
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
That's all.

104
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Do you know how much he has?

105
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Look.

106
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
After looking at it, you know how dark he is.

107
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
The bank is closed.

108
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
You did it.

109
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,760
The entire Shanghai financial industry is almost over.

110
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Because of the small-scale price.

111
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
The budget and plan of the genius

112
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,760
are the creativity in this room.

113
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,760
The bank is the only official bank in the world.

114
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
It's in the government.

115
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Do you know what's the most valuable thing in the world?

116
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Creativity.

117
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
The genius's creativity

118
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
is only the brain of the genius.

119
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
But your boss,

120
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
he's going to beat me.

121
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
He's going to背 over us

122
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
and secretly

123
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
print and print and test the water.

124
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
I'm so ugly.

125
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm so black.

126
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
I didn't expect

127
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
that you and these financial agencies

128
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
would have such a good relationship.

129
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
The bank is more expensive than me.

130
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
You're more interested in it than I am.

131
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
The boss of Huan Shan

132
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
is a black bag in Japan.

133
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
So I always say that

134
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
you're too simple.

135
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
You're too easy to be easy on others.

136
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
My lord.

137
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Our loss is too big this time.

138
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
All the votes are to be taken back.

139
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
All of them are to be taken back.

140
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,760
The votes for the only way to win

141
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
will be to be held in a year.

142
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
The most terrible thing is

143
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
the case is not solved yet.

144
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
What's the reason for the fake money?

145
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
No one knows.

146
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Who will get the good money?

147
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Tell me.

148
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Who?

149
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
From the real estate of the fake money,

150
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
the domestic business is not bad.

151
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
The Lord told me that

152
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
half a year ago,

153
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
the Japanese Bank

154
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
and our negotiations

155
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
were very close.

156
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
When we were talking about the contract,

160
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
the Lord refused.

161
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
You mean that

162
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
the fake money came from Japan?

163
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
If we're wrong,

164
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
who will pay the debt?

165
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
I'm sorry.

167
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
What's the matter?

168
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
I'm sorry.

169
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
I'm sorry.

172
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Songgong.

173
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Songgong.

174
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Songgong.

175
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
The case is broken.

176
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Broken?

177
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Did the British help the Japanese Bank?

178
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Who did it?

179
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,760
The fake money was caught by the Japanese.

180
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
After the interrogation,

181
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
they admitted that

182
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
the fake money

183
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
was stolen by the Japanese

184
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
from the East.

185
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
It's the Japanese.

186
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Take the fake money.

187
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Don't let anyone take the money.

188
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Yes.

189
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
The contract is complete.

190
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
The chief of the 15th-grade army has also taken it.

191
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Yes.

192
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Shuhong, where's the paper?

193
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
It's on the desk.

194
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
What's wrong?

195
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
What's wrong?

196
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
We have to move.

197
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
We have to move now.

198
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Move?

199
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Yes.

200
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Where should we move?

201
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
I don't know.

202
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Go, go, go.

203
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Pack up.

204
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Pack up.

205
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Pick up the important stuff.

206
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Hurry up.

207
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Don't stand there.

208
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Hurry up.

209
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Hurry up.

210
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Hurry up.

211
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Hurry up.

212
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Hurry up.

213
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Don't stand there.

214
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
We can't make it.

215
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Mr. Wu.

216
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Where are you going?

217
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
We...

218
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Mr. Wu.

219
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Mr. Wu.

220
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
What about the 10th-grade army?

221
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
It's strange.

222
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
We always have this time.

223
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
It's from the teacher.

224
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Please stop.

225
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
It's a slip.

226
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Did something happen?

227
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Is the teacher okay?

228
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Are you okay?

229
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm fine.

230
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm fine.

231
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm fine.

232
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
He might be coming back.

233
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Can't you come back to the teacher?

234
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Bye.

235
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Let's go.

236
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Let's go.

237
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Mr. Wu.

238
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
You are going back?

239
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
No way.

240
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
I don't have time for her.

241
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Mrs. Wu.

242
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,480
I couldn't stay at home alone.

243
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,880
I wanted to go back long ago.

244
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,640
But the winter was too cold.

245
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,040
I was afraid that he would freeze on the way.

246
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,720
But he was in a hurry to go back when the car was on the way.

247
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,800
So I took a colleague

248
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,360
and took him to the north.

249
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,920
What a pity.

250
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,800
I should have brought him to the funeral.

251
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,000
It's already a big trouble for you.

252
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,760
You're so nice.

253
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,600
I'm here to introduce you to the people in the community.

254
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,720
The whole place is so crowded.

255
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,120
I'll read it in Japanese.

256
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Yes.

257
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
Hira, are you aware of this?

258
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
When you look at the father's eyes

259
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,520
who is against the Chinese people,

260
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,080
don't you think he's already over the average person's expectations?

261
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,640
I'm sure you know that

262
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,280
Ayakura Kaka is not a good person.

263
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,080
I think that

264
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,800
he's the leader of the military in the future

265
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,520
and also the leader of the Chinese military in the future.

266
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,920
This way please.

267
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,600
This is the first time I've ever seen a person like him.

268
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
I'm Ryoko Kosei, a senior high schooler.

269
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,920
Please come in.

270
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm the chairman of the secret and secret company.

271
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm Ryoko.

272
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,520
Please come in.

273
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,880
This is the chairman of the secret and secret company,

274
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Mr. Kataoka.

275
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,720
Please come in.

276
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,880
I love you.

277
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,280
Let's drink.

278
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,880
He's not the one who's against the choice.

279
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,880
If that's the case,

280
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,560
there's no way that Russia won't like the selection of voice actors.

281
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,640
Ayakura Kaka is not that good at thinking.

282
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,240
What do you mean?

283
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,920
If you're so proud of yourself,

284
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,680
you'll be able to have a relationship with China and Japan.

285
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,240
Do you think that voice actors will be able to do that?

286
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,480
I understand now.

287
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,720
You're afraid of your students.

288
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,760
You're afraid of being a political leader.

289
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,920
I can't seem to copy China's culture.

290
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,600
The Chinese culture requires handheld self-agogues.

291
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,880
It will gain its dedication.

292
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,200
Mr. Cai.

293
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,800
Good.

294
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
This is the right time.

295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,100
I am Liang Xiang.

296
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,100
Do we know each other?

297
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,800
I bought your clothes and it hurts.

298
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,800
Mr. Lin likes it.

299
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,600
So I invited you.

300
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,800
I told you.

301
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,400
So you are like this.

302
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Come on.

303
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,400
This is the right time.

304
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Oh, right.

305
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Can I ask you a question?

306
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Tell me.

307
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,400
Is that Chinese girl who often contacts you?

308
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,400
You mean Shu Hong?

309
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Yes.

310
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
Hello, Mr. Lin.

311
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Hello, Mr. Lin.

312
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Hello, Mr. Lin.

313
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Hello, Mr. Lin.

314
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Hello, Mr. Lin.

315
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Hello.

316
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Do you like it?

317
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
How much?

318
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Five.

319
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's good.

320
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Here.

321
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
It's a little bit hard.

322
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Is it a middle-aged woman?

323
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
If so, leave your shoes here.

324
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Do you forget my shoes?

325
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
This is 100 yen.

326
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
100 yen?

327
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Go.

328
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Wait.

329
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
It's okay.

330
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
It's not good.

331
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
It's not good.

332
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Come on.

333
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Come on.

334
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Chinese?

335
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,600
You are the best Chinese I've ever seen.

336
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm sorry.

337
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
There is still a lot of white shoes.

338
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
I've got 10 yen more to go.

339
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
It's okay.

340
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
What's wrong?

341
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
I'm not sure.

342
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
What's wrong?

343
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I'm not sure.

344
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
You are a good Chinese.

345
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
You are my friend.

346
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
You are a good student.

347
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,600
But it doesn't matter how much you earn.

348
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Don't try to make me pay for the food.

349
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
You know that, right?

350
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
What's wrong?

351
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm sorry.

352
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
I'm sorry.

353
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
You are a good student.

354
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
You are a good student.

355
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
You are a good student.

356
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
I'm sorry.

357
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm sorry.

358
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
I'm sorry.

359
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Come back.

360
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Come back.

361
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
What's wrong?

362
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
What's wrong?

363
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Come back.

364
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
What's wrong?

365
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Tianman, what's wrong?

366
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Come back.

367
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Come back.

368
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
What's all this?

369
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
I'm looking for a job.

370
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
I'm at the night market.

371
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
I'm a worker.

372
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
A interview?

373
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
You want to be a interviewer?

374
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
I have three months left.

375
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
I'm not used to it.

376
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
I only need 15 yuan.

377
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Do you know how to make clothes?

378
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
I really want to keep it.

379
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
But the electrician is a sewing machine.

380
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
It's not very familiar.

381
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
The boss asked me to bring the old machine.

382
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
It's useful.

383
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Help me.

384
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Help me to make this machine.

385
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
It seems a little bit of a problem.

386
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Who are you?

387
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Why are you being so hard on me?

388
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
I'm talking to you.

389
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
You must be an old man.

390
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
You must...

391
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
I'm not lying.

392
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
What old man?

393
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
A young man.

394
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
If you don't make money,

395
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
do we have other options?

396
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Make money?

397
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
You must be a white man.

398
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
You...

399
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
You're a girl like this.

400
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
You can make clothes.

401
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
You can make clothes.

402
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Have you ever made clothes?

403
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Is it that hard?

404
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Take off your clothes first.

405
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Then you'll be fine.

406
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
You haven't answered me yet.

407
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Is your boss a man?

408
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Yes.

409
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
He's a big man.

410
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
You can't go.

411
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
You know what?

412
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
You can't go.

413
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Don't you think about

414
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
why he keeps you?

415
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
He thinks I'm suitable.

416
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
He's looking at me.

417
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
He wants to teach me how to make money.

418
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
I need money.

419
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Listen to you.

420
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Listen to you.

421
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Say it.

422
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
He wants to teach you how to make money.

423
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
To be honest,

424
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
he just likes your young man.

425
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
He likes your beauty.

426
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
That's right.

427
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
There are some good things in the shop.

428
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
The boss asked me to try it on.

429
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm wearing a beautiful suit.

430
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
It's suitable.

431
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
He asked you to wear a beautiful suit.

432
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
What does he want to do?

433
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
You're a man.

434
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
You're a man.

435
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
What does he want to do?

436
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Don't go.

437
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Don't go.

438
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Wu Tianan.

439
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
What's the matter?

440
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Listen to you.

441
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
You're a man.

442
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Can you be so honest?

443
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Yes.

444
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
You said you wanted to make a bomb.

445
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
And make money.

446
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
You're all smashed.

447
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
You're making the Shanghai Police Department

448
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
a crime.

449
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
My family is so rich.

450
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I don't want to eat or drink.

451
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I don't want to play with you anymore.

452
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
It's too hard.

453
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
If you don't want to go,

454
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
we can only be separated.

455
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Look.

456
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
You're living your life.

457
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
You're living your life.

458
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Is this enough?

459
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
I'm sorry.

460
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I'm sorry.

461
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
It's done.

462
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
It's done.

463
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
The boss said

464
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
this machine is made of rice wine.

465
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
You don't know who he is.

466
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
He's a machine.

467
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
He's a machine.

468
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Excuse me.

469
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
It's okay.

470
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
I'm going to take it.

471
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Take it.

472
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Take it.

473
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
You're used to it.

474
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
You remember it from the beginning.

475
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
You should be a little more careful.

476
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
You should be careful.

477
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Yes, I will.

478
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Oh.

479
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
This is Mr. Oshima.

480
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
It's been a while.

481
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Oh.

482
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
This girl is here.

483
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
It's a new design from the shop.

484
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Mr. Oshima,

485
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

486
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Yes.

487
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
This is our new design.

488
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Here you go.

489
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Mr. Oshima,

490
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
come here.

491
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Yes.

492
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Please take a good look at Mr. Oshima.

493
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Mr. Oshima,

494
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
thank you for your help.

495
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Where did you get the money?

496
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Sorry,폍 y the driver?

497
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
I borrowed money from your boss

498
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
to fluorinate burdock.

499
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
And the old pe вперon

500
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
was to blame me my hair process.

501
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
I thought it's a lucky name.

502
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Still say what comes

503
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
to your head.

504
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Valоровo你接应.

505
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,840
And my boss

506
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
just ignored your form for me

507
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
so that you can really beat

508
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,840
yourself without any dongs and

509
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Logic armpitis

510
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
I've only studied

511
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,700
imm propio

512
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
for five years.

513
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,440
You've been using me.

514
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,920
You even gave me a half-month salary.

515
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Then I'll do such a good thing.

516
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,320
Eat.

517
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,360
I haven't eaten anything proper for the past two days.

518
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,560
I'm still afraid of problems.

519
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,600
I promised your brother-in-law to protect you.

520
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I'm responsible for you.

521
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
That's right.

522
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
You are the one who sent the God to take care of me.

523
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Eat.

524
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,880
My benefactor.

525
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,600
You have to protect me when you're full, right?

526
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
I'm hungry.

527
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
You've been running around the chicken shop for two or three times.

528
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Didn't you see me?

529
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I went to the market.

530
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I saw that the sound was not reliable.

531
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
And, did the boss know about it?

532
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Promise me.

533
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Don't run away.

534
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Okay?

535
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
You're like this.

536
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
You're making me feel sour.

537
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Sour?

538
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
I'm making you feel sour.

539
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
You're a person with a good education.

540
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
You have the ability to speak four languages.

541
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
According to you,

542
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
the whole country's public opinion is not like you.

543
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
You're all confused.

544
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
You need to be happy and you need to be excited, right?

545
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
This is not like you.

546
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
The country is the leader.

547
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
The intellectuals are the grain of the nation.

548
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
So,

549
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
the one who bought the land is the public opinion of the world.

550
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Don't be so careless.

551
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Put your eyes on the old man, the young man.

552
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
What's the matter again?

553
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
The boss of the company has started to call me Cai Jian.

554
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Yes, it's the material of the material he's selling.

555
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Let me explain it later.

556
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Tonight,

557
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
I have to take care of the same thing as Cai Jian.

558
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Old things are still in the market.

559
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Cai Yi,

560
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
every sword has its own style.

561
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Cai Jian Fang is always changing.

562
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
But it's not easy.

563
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Don't listen to him.

564
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Isn't it just Zhao Hu Lu's painting?

565
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
What's the problem?

566
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Come on, let me see.

567
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
It's just that the face and the sleeves are a bit different.

568
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
This is a combination of the two.

569
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
You can't just take it and use it.

570
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
You have to put the powder brush on top to make it look like this.

571
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
You have to use a special computer to make it look like this.

572
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Let's go.

573
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I'll make you one for tonight.

574
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
What's that?

575
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Yes,

576
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
we have a doctor in this house.

577
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
It's a pity that he's a bad doctor.

578
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
These are the dishes.

579
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I'll teach you when you're done.

580
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Yes.

581
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
You can do it.

582
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Sure.

583
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Let's get the man.

584
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Mom,

585
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
go, go.

586
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Mom, I'm going to buy you a drink.

587
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
I'm going to buy you a drink.

588
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Why didn't you sleep last night?

589
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Don't move.

590
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Don't move.

591
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Don't move.

592
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
You have to keep your guard up.

593
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
You can't do it if you're angry.

594
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Okay,

595
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
you've become a great master.

596
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
What's so hard about it?

597
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Let me tell you,

598
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
my combination of the two

599
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
is even more powerful than my drawing.

600
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
It's a great deal.

601
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Oh my god.

602
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Did you make a fortune?

603
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Do you know

604
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,600
why I can be so quick to get a job?

605
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
I've never had such a good memory.

606
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Yes, why?

607
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
I have love in my heart.

608
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
I'm not learning any art.

609
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm using my love

610
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
to be with other men.

611
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
You're talking nonsense again.

612
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I'm telling the truth.

613
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
A woman like you

614
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
should have a better future.

615
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Otherwise,

616
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm sorry.

617
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Look carefully.

618
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
It's okay.

619
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
I drew it for you.

620
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Just draw it with the line.

621
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
You're so good.

622
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
You're not good at drawing.

623
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Men and women are not good at drawing.

624
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
I'm blessing you.

625
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I'm just kidding.

626
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
What's your name?

627
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,600
How is the car?

628
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
I can't believe it.

629
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
You're a genius

630
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
even though it's just a few days.

631
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I've been working on it.

632
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
I've been working on it for two nights.

633
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
If you keep going,

634
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
you'll be able to take a job

635
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,600
by yourself.

636
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Everyone,

637
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
listen.

638
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Did you see that?

639
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Your coach is higher than the school.

640
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Look at the clothes.

641
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
I'm still in the front,

642
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
but I've done this much work.

643
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Everyone,

644
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
please be careful.

645
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Don't give your coach.

646
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
He's always in the back.

647
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Move your hand.

648
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,600
schools

649
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,600
The red eyes are born to be a man's wind

650
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,600
I will be honored

651
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
This song is a dream

652
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Leave the light of love to shine on the starry sky

653
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:25,600
The red eyes are born to be a man's wind

654
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:32,600
The red eyes are born to be a man's wind

655
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:38,600
I will be honored

656
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
This song is a dream

657
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Leave the light of love to shine on the starry sky

658
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,600
The red eyes are born to be a man's wind

659
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:58,600
The red eyes are born to be a man's wind

660
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:04,600
I will be honored

661
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,600
This song is a dream

662
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Leave the light of love to shine on the starry sky

663
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:18,600
The red eyes are born to be a man's wind

664
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:25,600
The red eyes are born to be a man's wind

665
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:31,600
I will be honored

666
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,600
This song is a dream

667
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Leave the light of love to shine on the starry sky
