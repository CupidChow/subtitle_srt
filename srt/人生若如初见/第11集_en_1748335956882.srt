00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
Four May bonsai

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The End

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 3

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey, take off your clothes.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's beautiful.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Your clothes are beautiful too.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
More closely.

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, like that.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stretch your spine.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, smile.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Shikuko, you're the one who's going to win the award.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're going to wear my new design.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've paid for it.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Your smile is 200 yen.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You understand, right?

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Look at that girl.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She's so pretty.

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's good.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, let's do it.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
One, two, three.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Comrades,

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the revolutionary style in the country is

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the wind-up movement.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In Japan,

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
there are the revolutionary groups

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that are like spring bamboo shoots.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They're all out of their heads.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But revolutionary,

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
there's only one reason for it.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The so-called

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
military-tank movement,

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the cold grass, the fresh air,

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
we have money.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now, there are many businessmen

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
who have accumulated revolutionary funds for us.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've brought them all.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But, the ugly words are in front of me.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Every one of them

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
needs to be used in the knife.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
As a revolutionary,

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we need to change the kind of

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
big-handed,

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and arrogant,

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and make trouble.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yifan, good for you.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Speaking of money,

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I heard that the money in China

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
will soon be spent on the economy.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It will be spent on the future.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
After hearing the news,

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I heard that

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
someone can help me find him.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brother Tang,

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
why are you in the East China Sea?

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm here to do business.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm just looking for my brother.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Help me.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's the matter?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I heard that

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you're as good as in the East China Sea.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where's Xia Chuan?

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You have to help me find him.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We have a colleague who is making trouble there.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll think of a way to help me find him.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's the matter?

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Dad, I'm here.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's okay.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm here to help you.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll go now.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll go to the shop.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have something to tell you.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sit here.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Come on.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No, no.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't drink.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't drink.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're in trouble.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
My business is going to be a success.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You come and help me find him.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll go to the shop.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Cheers.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Cheers.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Cheers.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Cheers.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Cheers.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Cheers.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Cheers.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Cheers.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Cheers.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Cheers.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I haven't heard from you for a long time.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Are you with someone in Osaka?

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well...

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm a special person.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Are you a man or a woman?

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm a special person from the last year.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You come to the shop often.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Are you the man who's in the back?

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, I've known you for a long time.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you have that kind of relationship?

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No, no.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm just a special person.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That man is also a really lucky man.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's a good person.

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He brings me delicious food when I'm in trouble.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
When I feel fear, he takes me to the shop.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In Japan, there are people like you who are poor.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They have a lot of physical and mental abilities.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They don't know who to save.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's why a man who is like a woman comes out.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That kind of man is a secret.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But he's a very good person.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, a good person?

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you have a good person in the man who is like a woman?

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What kind of person is he?

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm a good person.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're good at making fun of me.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What do you think of my man?

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He's a good person.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't care if he's a good person.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I just make money.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
A man who works for a woman and doesn't make money is a man.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
As you know, I've been a woman for years.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Many people have come to talk about how to save the life of a woman.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But I couldn't help it.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm looking for a woman who can help me with this shop.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't know, but when you came here to look for a job,

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I was the first person to like you.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I've been looking for you for three months.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think you didn't see me.

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What do you think?

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Don't you think we look good together?

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm a man who's not a man.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I know that.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But I'm a man who cares about women.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're really a good person.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I believe in you.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm a good person.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I believe in you.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I want you to leave it to me.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You'll be wearing the clothes of this store.

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You'll be wearing my clothes.

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You'll be more beautiful.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If you put on my cover and come to the new exhibition,

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
you'll be rich soon.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't think we look good together.

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I want to put on the clothes of this store.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I want to put on the clothes of this store.

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I want to put on the clothes of this store.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't want to talk to you.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I want to go home and think about it.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll come to the new exhibition tomorrow.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
These dresspies are for my work.

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,900
I wonder how many

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,880
times I always wear them.

163
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,840
The first is the poem.

164
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,000
The next is the zigzag.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The biggest thing in the world is called Ling Xiu.

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Being Ling Xiu is hard.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's wrong?

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Something new?

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What's wrong?

170
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Nothing.

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why are you so stubborn?

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Mr. Wu.

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let me tell you this.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm afraid I'll lose my job tomorrow.

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Why?

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Why? I don't want to do it.

177
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No.

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You have to tell me clearly.

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I...

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't open up a little.

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm tired of being here today.

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm so tired of being here.

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're back and you're not doing it.

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm so tired of being here.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I...

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Boss Ji asked me to marry him.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Boss Ji asked me to marry him.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Are you willing?

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you're willing, I'll marry him.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No.

191
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Just let me know.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is it all that hard for you?

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No matter how hard you try, you'll never get through.

194
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm done.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I support you.

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Tomorrow,

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
you'll take that yellow button as your own.

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Excuse me.

199
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Do you have any questions about

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the Chinese people's social status?

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What's your relationship with them?

202
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm a relative.

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
A relative?

204
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
A relative?

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A relative?

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, a relative.

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
A relative.

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Everyone,

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
your relative

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
has a friend's teacher.

211
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I paid 200 yen for this.

212
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If it's a relative,

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll pay 200 yen for the one I paid

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
for the other girl.

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
200 yen for you?

216
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, 200 yen.

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What do you mean?

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
A week ago,

219
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that girl

220
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
disappeared without a word.

221
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
She got married to a job.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So,

223
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll pay this money

224
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
for the other girl.

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's a new job, isn't it?

226
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're right.

227
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What kind of money

228
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
do you have to pay?

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I paid the money.

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
She got away.

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't know

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
what else I can do.

233
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You don't want to go to the police station?

234
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well,

235
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the man who took her

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
was suspicious of her.

237
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well,

238
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
are you going to pay

239
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
at the police station?

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Or,

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
are you going to pay here?

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hello.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hello.

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hello.

245
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Please come in.

246
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Hello.

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Hello.

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Please come in.

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hello.

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Please come in.

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think we're meeting somewhere.

252
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you remember?

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Sorry, this is a bad time.

254
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You forgot?

255
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,800
I'll give you a bread to your boyfriend on the cruise.

256
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,320
You're the last few, the last few.

257
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm afraid you're not as good as the others.

258
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,560
Stop it. Go away.

259
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,520
I'm busy.

260
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Where's my bag?

261
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
This is yours.

262
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,280
You went to the nightclub?

263
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Yes.

264
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,640
I spent 200 yuan to buy it.

265
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,920
You deserve it.

266
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,280
Who told you to do this?

267
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,320
How can you care about money?

268
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,040
We're relatives.

269
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,200
Who are your relatives?

270
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,920
You're the one who made Yang Yifan.

271
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,440
How did you know?

272
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,880
He's my cousin.

273
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,440
I'm his cousin.

274
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,840
My name is Yang Kaizhi.

275
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
On the cruise to the East,

276
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,280
I didn't expect you to be the top five.

277
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,080
The top five of the world.

278
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,760
Why are you here in the East?

279
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,920
It's the Sun Wen of the Star Society.

280
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,680
We have no chance of meeting with the Star Society.

281
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,640
Really?

282
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,840
With Sun Wen and Meng?

283
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,960
Let's talk about it.

284
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
Can we talk about it?

285
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,680
I'm not sure.

286
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,960
What did you say to me?

287
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,320
The East's police said

288
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,760
they haven't cancelled your investigation.

289
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,360
They hope you can be the top seven.

290
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,680
What?

291
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,400
He doesn't know the truth about the previous hero?

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Look, here's the money.

293
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,160
If you don't sell flowers,

294
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,040
I won't let you run away.

295
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,920
How dangerous it is to run on the street

296
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,880
with a girl?

297
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,920
Just for a few hours.

298
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,200
You'll starve to death

299
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,520
if you don't have those money.

300
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,800
You can't talk about it here.

301
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,960
What are you talking about?

302
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,480
I'm the one who's thinking.

303
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,600
How can I get the money?

304
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Just blow it.

305
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,400
Why don't you blow it when you don't have food?

306
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,520
I'll blow it now.

307
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
Look, here's the money.

308
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,640
Han Hua knows how much I owe him.

309
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,520
Can I be the top seven?

310
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,240
You say Kaizhi, right?

311
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,280
What else did you say?

312
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,520
Your brother-in-law

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,840
hopes you can go back to the East with me.

314
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,360
No.

315
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,760
What do you mean, Han Hua?

316
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,720
You want to disband us?

317
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,040
After you left Shanghai,

318
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,560
the people from Shanghai went to Anqing.

319
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,520
Your sister was shocked.

320
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,760
Liu Chang'er.

321
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,160
My sister didn't have a child?

322
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,720
Yes.

323
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,560
What about my dad and mom?

324
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,600
They're also tired.

325
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
I heard Yifan say that

326
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,200
the shop is still open.

327
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,480
But the business is better than before.

328
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,840
Your dad is still fine.

329
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
The tea in Shanghai is brown.

330
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,840
He doesn't have any alcohol.

331
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,240
When Yifan came to the East,

332
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,800
your dad asked him to lend him money.

333
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600
He hoped you wouldn't pay me back.

334
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,760
He stayed in the East to study.

335
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,400
Yifan has contacted

336
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,520
the Qing Shan ten-year-old girl school in the East.

337
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
The summer singing class of the Qing Shan girl school

338
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,600
has been agreed.

339
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
So you went back to the East with me.

340
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,680
Mr. Wu.

341
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
What do you think?

342
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,680
What else can I say?

343
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,960
He followed me all the way.

344
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,920
He had too many troubles.

345
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
There's no reason

346
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,240
to let him follow me.

347
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
Study is a good arrangement.

348
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,200
You should study well.

349
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,800
When I see you,

350
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,200
I should study hard

351
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,360
to gain some knowledge.

352
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,160
Don't go.

353
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,840
So as he goes on like that,

354
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,680
he has no fresh air.

355
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,160
Noo!?

356
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,080
Stop it!

357
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,440
Shut up!

358
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,920
Who the hell do you think you are?

359
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,500
Me without money.

360
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Are you crying?

361
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Cry?

362
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Are you going to cry?

363
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
You're not going to die?

364
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Answer me!

365
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
I'm not crying.

366
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Call for help!

367
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Answer me!

368
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I'm not crying!

369
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
No!

370
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
You...

371
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
You're going to take back your face!

372
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
You're going to take back your face!

373
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Hurry!

374
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Hurry!

375
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Hurry!

376
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Hurry up!

377
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Hurry up!

378
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Hey, slow down!

379
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Hurry up!

380
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Hurry up!

381
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Hurry up!

382
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Hey, you!

383
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Hurry up!

384
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Hurry up!

385
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Hurry up!

386
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Hurry up!

387
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
I'm done.

388
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Student, your feelings are already received.

389
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Hurry up!

390
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Sit down!

391
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Hurry up!

392
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Sit down!

393
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
You still want to do that?

394
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Don't think about it. It's already over.

395
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Oh, right.

396
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Bai Chen, I'll give you this.

397
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Pack it up.

398
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Don't, Tu Fang. How can this work?

399
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Pack it up.

400
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Tu Fang, you...

401
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Take it.

402
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Don't take it.

403
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Tu Fang, you...

404
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Ren Jun, you're so open-minded.

405
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Let's go.

406
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Let's go.

407
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Let's go.

408
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Let's go.

409
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Let's go.

410
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
You're so kind.

411
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
You're so kind.

412
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
You're so kind.

413
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
You're so kind.

414
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
What did you say to him?

415
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
What can I say?

416
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,500
He went to find a train to the Yellow Carp to go to the Red Light District.

417
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
What?

418
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Oh, God.

419
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
The farm village in Shandong is a good place to go.

420
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
We met a Japanese instructor.

421
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
He killed a person.

422
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
You have to let him find his own way.

423
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Then you can't go to the Red Light District.

424
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
You're listening to me?

425
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
You're right.

426
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
He's here.

427
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
You're going to the Red Light District?

428
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Yes.

429
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
It's about the food.

430
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,500
You're going to kill a person now?

431
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I kill a person?

432
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Sir, I don't understand what you're talking about.

433
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
The behavior you're doing today has already been known.

434
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
You're in the east of the East of the Gong Lan.

435
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
You're in the east of the Gong Lan.

436
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
You're in the east of the Gong Lan.

437
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
You're in the east of the Gong Lan.

438
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
To fight against the Japanese,

439
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
you have to take your life back.

440
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
That's your idea.

441
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
The instructor is coming.

442
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I will take you to the Red Light District.

443
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
You think...

444
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,500
you're very wise,

445
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,500
and you can sell your life

446
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
and make money.

447
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,500
I am looking for the death of the Japanese elite.

448
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:39,500
But first, you must remember, understand, and realize my spirit.

449
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Otherwise, you will never be able to graduate from here.

450
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,500
If it really is true...

451
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Then you will have no point in learning here.

452
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,500
This is your own failure to graduate.

453
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,500
It is also my failure to be a teacher.

454
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Liu Tian, I am going to kill you!

455
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
What are you doing?

456
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,500
How can I protect this old dog?

457
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
I am going to kill you!

458
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Why?

459
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Why did you do that?

460
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I am going to kill you!

461
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Stop!

462
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
What are you doing?

463
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,500
I am going to kill you!

464
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
What are you doing?

465
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,500
I am going to kill you!

466
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,500
I am going to kill you!

467
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,500
I am going to kill you!

468
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Take him to the hospital.

469
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Hello.

470
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
I am reporting.

471
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
I have arrived at the hospital.

472
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Come in.

473
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Did you get your hand hurt?

474
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,500
I am going to kill you.

475
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Thank you.

476
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
I got it.

477
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,500
You are not feeling well.

478
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
I am not feeling well.

479
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I was going to be a woman.

480
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:34,500
I did my best, but I did not get my power.

481
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:46,500
52 people died in the war.

482
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,500
I am not sure if I can survive this.

483
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Many of you have been killed.

484
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:05,500
That young man is one of them.

485
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Young man?

486
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
What do you mean?

487
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,500
You are going to kill a military man.

488
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Is it not a good start?

489
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,500
I do not know what you mean.

490
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,500
You might be right.

491
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,500
What did you say in the past?

492
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:41,500
One bomb, three bombs, one bullet, three shots.

493
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,500
I am going to kill you.

494
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Yes, sir.

495
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
By the way,

496
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Miss Fen Zi told me to tell you about her teacher.

497
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,500
She is the head of the Dongjing Regions.

498
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Miss Ge Zi is going to have a tea party in the next few days.

499
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Miss Fen Zi wants to ask you for a favor.

500
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Thank you for your kindness.

501
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I can't go.

502
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,500
I have another arrangement for the next few days.

503
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I want to investigate military history.

504
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
I see.

505
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,500
I will tell her.

506
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Be careful.

507
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,500
This is a school that the head of the Dongjing Regions

508
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
was established in the school.

509
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
That is right.

510
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,500
There is a tea party in the school.

511
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,500
The school was established in the middle of the year.

512
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
It was in the middle of the year.

513
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Most of the students from Hong Kong are from the family of the Tokyo family.

514
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,500
It is Sunday today, so everyone is going home.

515
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,500
We will return by 8 p.m.

516
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,500
So, why not pack your things first?

517
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,500
It's a name of the school, right?

518
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Oh, well, let's get to know each other first.

519
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Tomorrow, the head of the Dongjing Regions

520
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,500
will be assigned to you.

521
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Let's get started.

522
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,500
First, take this blanket by hand.

523
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Yes, like this.

524
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Take it by hand.

525
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,500
The head of the Dongjing Regions

526
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,500
is assigned to you.

527
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
The head of the Dongjing Regions

528
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,500
is assigned to you.

529
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
The head of the Dongjing Regions

530
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
is assigned to you.

531
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500
The head of the Dongjing Regions

532
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
is assigned to you.

533
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,500
The head of the Dongjing Regions

534
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
is assigned to you.

535
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Zhang Zhang.

536
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Why are you here?

537
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
I can't even recognize you.

538
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,500
They just cleaned you up.

539
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,500
At least you have to pay 50 yuan for the medical treatment.

540
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
I'll give you a minute.

541
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
You're so desperate.

542
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
I...

543
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I can't pay the rent or the bread.

544
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
You know me best.

545
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
How much do you want?

546
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Well, I'm here in Dongjing.

547
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
I need to meet some people.

548
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
I have to have a proper meeting.

549
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
But Dongjing's meeting is too expensive.

550
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Okay, don't be so serious.

551
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Enough.

552
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
I'll call you later.

553
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
I'm not going to be here.

554
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Don't tell your brother-in-law I'm here.

555
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I'll call you later.

556
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Don't be so desperate.

557
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Are you really staying in the room?

558
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
The person who came to the school last night

559
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,500
was assigned to you.

560
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
That's right.

561
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,500
This Yang Kai-zhi is a real man.

562
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
He's a real man.

563
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
We have to take care of him.

564
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Sit down.

565
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
Actually, I have an appointment tonight.

566
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
He's Japanese.

567
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
He's not Japanese.

568
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
He's not Japanese, right?

569
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Guess who he is.

570
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Who is he?

571
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,500
The old man you signed.

572
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,500
My old friend?

573
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Master Yun?

574
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Yes, the representative of the Japanese.

575
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
I see.

576
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
It's him.

577
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Why can't you go to me?

578
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
I don't want to go.

579
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
I can't go either.

580
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Do you know why he's forcing you to sign?

581
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Tell me.

582
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,500
He told me that Yuan Shi-Kai

583
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,500
left a mark on me in the three cities of Beiyang.

584
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
He asked me to follow him.

585
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Oh, my god.

586
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
A mark?

587
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
He asked you to be the president?

588
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
So?

589
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
He's the president?

590
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,500
The president?

591
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Yes.

592
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Why not?

593
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
You're the new general of Beiyang.

594
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
You can also find a tree to grow.

595
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Right?

596
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
He gave me a mark.

597
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Yuan Shi-Kai is just

598
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
making me a boss.

599
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
I'm a loyal man.

600
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,500
I can't be the old man.

601
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
You can't, Mr. Tu.

602
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
You're a manager.

603
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
You can't be the old man.

604
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
You must...

605
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Let me introduce my good friend.

606
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
She's a rich and wealthy girl.

607
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Miss Li Zhu Ji.

608
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
Ke Zhi.

609
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500
This is too exaggerated.

610
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
You can't find a good friend.

611
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
You can't find a good friend.

612
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
You can't find a good friend.

613
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Ke Zhi likes you.

614
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Even if you're a woman from Yao Zi,

615
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
we all have to help you.

616
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Go ahead.

617
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
What are you talking about?

618
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Nice to meet you.

619
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Nice to meet you.

620
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,500
I'm a good friend.

621
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
You're a good friend.

622
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
I Modi.

623
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
I got smell of King of the United Kingdom.

624
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
I was late.

625
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
We could havebert together a year ago.

626
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Thank god.

627
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
So, Yuan Xiao Xiang?

628
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
He brought the medicine to you.

629
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
But you went away right now.

630
00:38:59,500 --> 00:38:59,800
What the hell are you

631
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
doing?

632
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Nothing.

633
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
I'm in physical care.

634
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,500
Be patient.

635
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
I don't know how could you two end up like this?

636
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Ke Zhi.

637
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,620
Yes, since your good friend is here,

638
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,820
you should take a picture of him tonight.

639
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,260
It's a good idea.

640
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,180
Get on the car.

641
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,820
He's not here yet.

642
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,780
Wait for him.

643
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,420
Get on the car.

644
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,620
Yes.

645
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,620
You're making money again.

646
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,220
You can ask us to take a picture,

647
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,460
okay?

648
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,940
You're taking a picture of Chaoxian's clothes.

649
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,620
You dare not do anything about it?

650
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,980
It's late.

651
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,380
I'm sorry.

652
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,940
Let me introduce you.

653
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,980
This is my brother, Yang Yifan.

654
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,380
I'm from Hanhua.

655
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,780
I'm Miyabi.

656
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,900
Put it on.

657
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,820
Understood, sir.
