It's seventeen o'clock.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You would be against it if it's seventeen o'clock.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's a pity.

We can see that a star is in the sky on Thalun.

It off-spring a Vogon.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It is faster to float up the sky than to fall down.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It off-spring a Tiger on Thalun.

Hurry up!

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All of them are from the Tang's factory.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They are from the Xie Cong in Jinzhou.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I wonder if they will be able to prove their innocence.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hurry up!

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They are both under attack.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They are in a fight.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We should not reveal anything.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Then how do we deal with them?

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Very long time.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Very long time.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Kill them all.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't kill them all.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't kill them all either.

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let them bet on their own luck.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you doing?

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you so excited?

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You little kid.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Why are you here?

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Can't you learn?

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
My master is not in the office today.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He said he has a hot spot.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will borrow the card from him.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He ran fast.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He is the first one to arrive.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You are so stupid.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are a kid.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why are you looking at me?

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Be careful.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let the little boy take care of you.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I am not afraid of the second uncle.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I am afraid of the third uncle.

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The thing about the Kanao River is the sound.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When it comes to the reason,

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
it should be the most important thing

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
to choose the most important thing in the day.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
At least,

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the sun must be set.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Look at the weather.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It is not good.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
53 guests.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Two pairs of 잡els.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Search for them.

Yun Aiguo.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How old are you?

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
17.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're going to turn 17?

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What a pity.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not a good boy.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Go.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go.

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's the fate of the Du family.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't panic.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You have three points.

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
One point for one.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The second point for one point.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The third point for one point.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The fourth point for one point.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Go.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't read the two-pointed coin.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Kill him.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The death is on your mind.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hold it well.

150
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,180

151
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,200
Didn't listen carefully

152
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Caution

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What are you doing?

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Taozi.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Next.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Go.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Go home.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You said you were the best.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Other people are afraid that you won't be able to survive.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Get up.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll take you back.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll take care of Qi Ying's soldiers.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If anyone catches you again, I'll take care of you.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's go.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Go.

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Go.

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Be careful.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're afraid of people because you're too fast.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You dare to do it in the morning.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You dare not do it in the evening.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I agree because I'm too fast.

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Stop.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm too slow.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
To be honest,

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm a student from Taozi University.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm a student from Tan Dao.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll scold you if you go back late.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're not Qi Ying.

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We Qi people are always the best.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But we have to be full of strength.

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm still a little bit left.

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're also a little bit.

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's right.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We're the best.

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yang Zi, the young master is here.

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Uncle, I'm in the class.

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't be afraid.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't fall.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't fall.

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't fall.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You're welcome.

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Thank you.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
People are always the best.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We are the best.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We are the best.

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We are the best.

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We are the best.

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We are the best.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Where are you going?

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The outside world is in chaos.

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I...

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Kneel.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Didn't you say

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
he went home to compare me?

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mr. Yi, kneel down for me.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Kneel.

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Six thousand is not suitable.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's filial.

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The country is in chaos.

212
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's loyal.

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But you guys are the best.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't you have any

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
filial piety?

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What's wrong?

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This bowl of water is broken.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
My mother is gone.

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not enough to swallow.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's just Liang Xiang.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're the culprit.

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You said

223
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I shouldn't have gone back with this bowl of water.

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm not saying you're the best.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If you're lying,

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
the master won't spare you.

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes.

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The master won't spare you.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm running away.

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Look at you.

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What should I do with you guys?

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If I go back with this bowl of water,

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
what will you lose to me?

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you can,

235
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
we'll have twenty fried ghosts.

236
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You said that.

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't regret it.

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If you can't get it out,

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
you'll have to ask us

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
to have twenty fried ghosts.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We have to tell the master.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Then let's bet.

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's bet.

245
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's bet.

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's really good.

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He's really good.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't be silly.

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's go home.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Liang Xiang.

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're really good.

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You little...

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You're all so good.

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Twenty fried ghosts.

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Let's go home.

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's go home.

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's go.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What did I tell you?

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Your father left early.

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're the only mother.

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're the only mother.

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You're the only mother.

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're the only mother.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why can't you study well

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and be so angry with me?

266
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I know it wrong.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Really?

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you seventeen or eighteen?

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're adult.

270
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You should know how to get into the world.

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You're going out?

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm always on the bed.

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Master's family wants to ask

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Mrs. Hu Guangyan to be the maid.

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Why did you ask me

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
to be your maid?

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know what it is.

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hong now.

279
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What's this?

280
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Put me on the phone.

281
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll put you in the bed.

282
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The headroom is тíqásu.

283
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why are you still doing this?

284
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Now, are you sure you want me to put you on the bed?

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're drunk.

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You think I ran away?

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't you?

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It znas.

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's so messy.

290
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
These two heads are so beautiful.

291
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What are these dog officials doing?

292
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
They're making fun of us.

293
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You guys are making a bunch of heads on your heads.

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
How can you cut your head?

295
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The woman in the old house is cutting her head.

296
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
She's only expensive, not cutting her head.

297
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're using your right hand to cut two heads.

298
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
When you're cutting your head,

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
you should be a little bit more careful.

300
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You should cut one head on the side.

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You can cut it three times.

302
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You can cut it three times.

303
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Show us how it's done.

304
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's it.

305
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's so pretty.

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's so pretty.

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's so pretty.

308
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Please treat us well.

309
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's a matter of the woman and the person.

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't understand your rules.

311
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
When you're here,

312
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you should help me out.

313
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't make mistakes.

314
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Make people laugh.

315
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I know, Madam.

316
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is my daughter, Duo Mei.

317
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Duo Mei, call Shen Shen.

318
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Shen Shen?

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
We're a couple.

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What's Shen Shen's name?

321
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
For example, Sixth Aunt,

322
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Seventh Aunt,

323
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and the local rank.

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Look, look, look.

325
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I almost made a mistake again.

326
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Later, when Madam Yan Shi comes,

327
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you should call her Third Aunt.

328
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Do you want to greet your father when you meet him?

329
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, I do.

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Then, do you want to greet your father?

331
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Or do you want to greet him alone?

332
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Men should greet each other.

333
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Women should greet each other.

334
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Please be nice.

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's what you want, Madam.

336
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's so pretty.

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's so pretty.

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Mei, have you seen it clearly?

339
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes, I have.

340
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
St ich, sing a song about my broken heart.

341
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It won't chase you anywhere.

342
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'll gladly let you sing a song.

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Come in, drinking tea?

344
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You must be very fast.

345
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You shouldon up your balls before some drinks.

346
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,380
Cook pork

347
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,980
We told her to make the food her own

348
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,480
We should do it

349
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,480
I have to go to Shanghai

350
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,860
Why do you still want to go there

351
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,560
And i have to admit they have not

352
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,640
My lady

353
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,440
Guikuo is here

354
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,760
I will come

355
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,300
My mother asked you to eat

356
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,760
とても腹血

357
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,700
I was so worried I forgot my wheel

358
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,500
To make her know the food

359
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Yes, I know.

360
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Gu Guang Yan Yue's wife is here.

361
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Go.

362
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I'll go now.

363
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I'll be there soon.

364
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Go.

365
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Gu Guang Yan Yue's wife is here.

366
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Gu Guang Yan Yue's wife is here.

367
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
What a beautiful girl.

368
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Greetings, Goddess San.

369
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Come.

370
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
What a beautiful girl.

371
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
How old is she?

372
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Goddess San, 17 years old.

373
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
She's so pretty.

374
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:51,100
Zhang Yundong,

375
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,900
Move over.

376
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,860
Let me take the scene here...

377
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,900
Headmaster Bi re Chuck Perfect is Alno

378
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,900
What?

379
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,400
Exactly

380
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Where are you all this time?

381
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Your Highness, twenty years ago,

382
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I married a woman to a whole family of two.

383
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Two were appointed by the court.

384
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
A few days ago, Nanjing sent me to the capital to work.

385
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
So that's how it is.

386
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
You're rich.

387
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I dare not look down on you in front of you.

388
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Get up.

389
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Today, the owner is free.

390
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,400
You don't have to be too formal.

391
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Come on.

393
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Please go to the wedding.

394
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Go.

395
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Get up.

396
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,400
This is the wedding dress.

397
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
This...

398
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm here today.

399
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
It's not convenient for her to be the chief.

400
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
I'll take her to sit.

401
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Everyone, sit.

402
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,400
The emperor asked me to point out the etiquette of the beggars.

403
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
That's it.

404
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Madam, please sit.

405
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Sit.

406
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
You don't have to be too formal.

407
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Just sit down and eat.

408
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

409
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Madam.

410
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Madam.

411
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
I really don't know.

412
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
You really don't know?

413
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I just know that he is the second-in-command of the beggars.

414
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
The other beggars...

415
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Do you know King of Rui Qing's Du Erguin?

416
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,400
The old ancestors of the White Qi

417
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
and the former royal father, Regent Wang.

418
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Du Erguin?

419
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
King of Rui Qing?

420
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Yes.

421
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
His mother's family is the royal family.

422
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
That's right.

423
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
His mother's family is the second-in-command of the Du Erguin.

424
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
You asked him to accompany me.

425
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
You...

426
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
You are so nice to me.

427
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Madam.

428
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Madam, I really don't know.

429
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Madam.

430
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Mother.

431
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Mother.

432
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Where is she?

433
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Mother.

434
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
She is so cute.

435
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
She is so cute.

436
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,400
There is a guest room upstairs.

437
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Son.

438
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Son.

439
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Son.

440
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Son.

441
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Son.

442
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Son.

443
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Son.

444
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Son.

445
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Son.

446
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Son.

447
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Son.

448
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Where is Yang Xiang?

449
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
He's here.

450
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Seems

451
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
I can't teach you.

452
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,720
You go to the Danzifang now.

453
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,120
They have something to do with you.

454
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,920
Master, please forgive me this time.

455
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,560
It's all because of the blood-stained poison, Master.

456
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,560
Master, please forgive him.

457
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,680
Master, please forgive him.

458
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,400
Please forgive him this time.

459
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
Mother will never dare to do it again.

460
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,880
Go, Liang Xiang.

461
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,480
I don't want to teach you.

462
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
I really don't.

463
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,680
What's wrong, Liang Zi?

464
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,080
You look like a pair of shoes.

465
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,880
How can I tell you?

466
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,440
We didn't expect that

467
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,840
your family would come to see you.

468
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
The official news that came yesterday

469
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,480
made you feel like you're in Shanghai.

470
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,120
Shanghai? Why?

471
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,040
Why? I also want to know why.

472
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,680
Why did you think of our Qing Dynasty's ancestors at this time?

473
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,240
Oh, it's too early to know.

474
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,360
One side is the internal chaos of the party,

475
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,560
the other side is the external chaos of the hunting force.

476
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,480
The battle of the Gangzi last year

477
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,560
broke out in the 8th-grade army of less than 20,000 people.

478
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,480
They haven't left yet.

479
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,160
They're still standing in your capital.

480
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,360
They've already played a few rounds.

481
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,800
What do you say? They can't play it.

482
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,440
They're lying and lying around.

483
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,840
Do you have any way?

484
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,320
No way.

485
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,760
The two have been sacrificed in Xi'an City.

486
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,800
That's why I thought of re-establishing the Five-Five-Six.

487
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,400
Look, there are a few words on the official news.

488
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,720
Compared with the ancestors of the Five-Five-Six,

489
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,640
the ancestors of the past are not familiar.

490
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,880
The ancestors are not aware of the great foundation of the culture,

491
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,000
and the ancestors are not aware of the people's world.

492
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,840
They are happy to have the opportunity to learn how to dance and dance.

493
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,400
Did you hear that, kid?

494
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,760
That means that those who have been suffering in the capital

495
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,600
have already been in the top of Xiulan City.

496
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,320
They can't find the right ancestors. That's why they found you.

497
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,640
Me?

498
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,280
I want to send you to Japan to learn military skills.

499
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,880
I've already seen it.

500
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,480
Japan?

501
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,200
Me?

502
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,240
Fu Dutong personally told you?

503
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,880
Yes.

504
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,120
The official news sent by Beijing?

505
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,040
Yes.

506
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,680
To study in the East?

507
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,200
Within three days, we'll have to go to Shanghai.

508
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,520
The cold weather is hot.

509
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,840
Yuti.

510
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,640
Get it clear.

511
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,040
But I can't, I can't...

512
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,400
I can't cry.

513
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,940
Once I�도 know,

514
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,180
God bless.

515
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,800
God bless!

516
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,460
Son!

517
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,880
BR怕'S

518
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
FAIL

519
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,680
I don't want to teach you.

520
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,160
I know.

521
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,880
I know.

522
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Bye.

523
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,760
Come here.

524
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,320
Let's go.

525
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,600
What do you think?

526
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,320
Me?

527
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,200
Come here.

528
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,000
I don't want to teach you.

529
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,680
You are Song Jia's third son, Song Chen, right?

530
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,240
Who are you?

531
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,080
Him.

532
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't have the time.

533
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,600
Wait a minute.

534
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,640
I know who you are.

535
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,480
The girl in the store in Kaventang.

536
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,280
I remember.

537
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,600
You are really bold.

538
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,280
Really?

539
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,960
You are hurting me.

540
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,200
See you later, Mr. Song.

541
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,960
I'll pass the paraffin.

542
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,580
No sense in chit-chatping in the house today.

543
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,840
No sense at all.

544
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,560
It's okay.

545
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,920
You really play Zhao Xia?"

546
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
I played a fool with him.

547
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,280
Then he believes it's me.

548
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,560
I think someone should give him a chance.

549
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,160
I'm looking for an air.

550
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,320
Go and sit on the train.

551
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,840
You stay...

552
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,680
Ju YIN atmosphere

553
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,680
My dad died of loneliness

554
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,360
Why do you talk to such an honest man?

555
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,420
How sum you want to talk to me?

556
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
You went to see him?

557
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,240
I told you, Xia Dao. I don't have to go see which bastard.

558
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,240
It has nothing to do with me. You should blame our father.

559
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,240
You've paid for the delivery. You should return to Shanghai.

560
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
That's great.

561
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Our father is not that kind of person.

562
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Then why don't you find a married man for me?

563
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
What's good about a married man?

564
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Your sister married a married man's empty name.

565
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,240
It's not that you're still working on your own at the end of the year.

566
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Don't be stubborn. I don't understand.

567
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Tell me.

568
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Is that thing like flipping books?

569
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,240
If you flip it over, you'll be fine, right?

570
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Don't talk nonsense.

571
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,240
What's the point of talking about that girl's house?

572
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Look, you're like this.

573
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
I won't come back to see your brother-in-law.

574
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
I won't come back.

575
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Why didn't you come?

576
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,240
This is not the delivery just now.

577
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Your brother-in-law is in Shanghai and he's not going to leave.

578
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
He still wants me to go there.

579
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Just a few words.

580
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Just say it clearly.

581
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Why are you writing so many words?

582
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Then, are you going there?

583
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
I'm in this state now.

584
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Isn't it a problem for your brother-in-law?

585
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,240
So I want to discuss something with you.

586
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Discuss with me?

587
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,240
Your brother-in-law is anxious about the material in this letter.

588
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
He has to send a package of medicine to someone.

589
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,240
I think you should help me with this.

590
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Me?

591
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Your mother-in-law...

592
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
My mother-in-law?

593
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,240
Song family is in Shanghai and they have a general name.

594
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,240
They have a special message every month.

595
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Your brother-in-law bought so many paper documents for us.

596
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,240
I think it's not very convenient to bring the delivery of Song family with you.

597
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
It's convenient for you.

598
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
I'll take the water and send it to you.

599
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
I'll send it to you by myself.

600
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,240
What are you talking about?

601
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
How could you be like this?

602
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
You don't want to go to Shanghai?

603
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Just go.

604
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

605
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

606
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

607
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

608
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

609
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

610
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

611
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

612
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

613
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

614
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

615
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

616
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

617
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

618
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

619
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

620
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

621
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

622
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

623
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

624
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

625
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

626
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

627
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

628
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Let's go to the suburb.

629
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

630
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,240
I'll send you to Shanghai.

631
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,400
and surrender with no introduction

632
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,120
We have been known myself as Prince of Chun

633
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,560
and has been visiting Germany

634
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,600
Get over here

635
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,960
We'll be sending lies

636
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,360
to each other

637
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,640
welcoming good times

638
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,680
So we must obey

639
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,080
and make up for our hard work

640
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,520
to bring the passionate home

641
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,320
Right?

642
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,560
Yes

643
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,340
Hello Mr.porz Ocean

644
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:24,620
It's been 20 years since we started it

645
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,560
See, my wife is not as caring as her

646
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,860
We do not know its behavior

647
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,680
Bring���可愛 swans here

648
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,780
Yue Lan

649
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,300
Who are you

650
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
I'll see you later.

651
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,300
This is the ticket you registered last year.

652
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
I brought it for you.

653
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
It's 20,000 yuan.

654
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
Please take a look.

655
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
You're from the Tang Caichang.

656
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,300
I'm my brother.

657
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Last year, I registered his 20,000 yuan for the ticket.

658
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,300
It's a pity that I'm not a good person.

659
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Zhang Zhidong killed my brother.

660
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,300
Do you think I can invest in this?

661
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,300
But he will tell me that

662
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,300
you have to pay the ticket

663
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,300
no matter what.

664
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
As a person,

665
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,300
you can do whatever you want.

666
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,300
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

667
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,300
President Song,

668
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,300
you can do whatever you want

669
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
with the tickets.

670
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
But

671
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,300
can you do me a favor?

672
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,300
Tell me.

673
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,300
I heard that you just started

674
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,300
to sponsor the two general capital

675
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
to send the military students to the Japanese.

676
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,300
What's going on?

677
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
Do you think

678
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,300
I can be one of them?

679
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
Hello.

680
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,300
Is Yang Yifan here?

681
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
Mr. Yang.

682
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
It's hard to find you.

683
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
What did you say?

684
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,300
His Majesty's brother is in Shanghai.

685
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
A big road is blocked with water and crabs.

686
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
It's a pity that the price is high.

687
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,300
Brother, why is His Majesty's brother so high?

688
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,300
It's not a matter of light and light.

689
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,300
It's a pity that he can be worth it.

690
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
He can be worth it?

691
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
How can he be worth it?

692
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,300
It's not enough.

693
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,300
Look.

694
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
The contract in Beijing

695
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
is under the conditions of the eight countries.

696
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
The court must send the first Prince of Qin

697
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
to Germany to be a member of the county.

698
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,300
You can say that it's worth it.

699
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Han Huan, you found the student?

700
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Where?

701
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,300
This is my aunt.

702
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
We've been in the report for seven days.

703
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
We haven't found her yet.

704
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Come slowly.

705
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,300
Come slowly.

706
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
I said how can they see me so excited?

707
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,300
It's a day's rent for one day.

708
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,300
Who did this school?

709
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,300
Me.

710
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,300
You?

711
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,300
I didn't expect that the rent is the advantage.

712
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,300
You can do anything

713
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
in the same way as a big bank,

714
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
a big shop,

715
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
a big factory,

716
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,300
or even a school.

717
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
No one can control you.

718
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
You can do whatever you want.

719
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,300
There's only one type of rent.

720
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
The rest is up to you.

721
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,300
Decide the system of the school.

722
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,300
The student's salary.

723
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,300
But why do you want to do it?

724
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,300
Good question.

725
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Such a big sale.

726
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,300
Can it make money?

727
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,300
My sister knows that it's urgent.

728
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,300
You're even more like your dad than your sister.

729
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Fine, you can stay here.

730
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
I can do whatever I want.

731
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,300
I want to talk to my colleague.

732
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,300
It's a big deal.

733
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Wait, brother-in-law.

734
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Why don't you look at it?

735
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,300
My sister brought you a bunch of food.

736
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Say it again.

737
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
By the way,

738
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
before you leave Shanghai,

739
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,300
I'll take you to a place where you can relax.

740
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,300
Okay?

741
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,300
Don't worry, brother-in-law.

742
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
You can't come here so slowly.

743
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,300
I can stay and help you.

744
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,300
You help me?

745
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,300
What do you mean?
