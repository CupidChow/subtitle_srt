00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to make a new one.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to keep a good position in it.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can make a new one.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to make a new design.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
I'm going to make a new set of the real reason of its existence.

50
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to make a new design.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We thought of the real good position of my solid position.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,580
It only could bring back our thought.

53
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,760
How about we work for the most important role?

54
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,880
The game is addressed to VLOG by Mary вами.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,040
Take me tosee the last episode

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,120
of VCO Tour Committee.

57
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,400
Alright.

58
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm leaving from the portal.

59
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,400
This is it.

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,580
I'll stay here for a while.

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,140
flawless調.

62
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Hey, Agami!

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Agami!

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Yes?

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Well, teacher!

66
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,760
I'm glad that you're back to your home.

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,760
My husband told me about you.

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,760
I'm so glad you're back.

69
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,760
I'm the boss!

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Oh, Mr. Depin!

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
How are you?

72
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,760
She's my daughter, Shuko Sedo.

73
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh, Shuko.

74
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
I'm sorry to have to see you.

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Thank you for coming.

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Is this your room?

77
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Yes.

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Yes.

79
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
The sheets are newly drawn.

80
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,760
I've made the room's room as it is.

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,760
The table is full of things you left behind.

82
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
I'll be waiting for you later.

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
First, please take a deep breath with us.

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Here you go.

85
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Here you go.

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,760
The food is always ready.

87
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,760
I'll be waiting for your favorite food.

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Take your time.

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Thank you.

90
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
What did he say to you?

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
He said all the formalities.

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
How could he be so familiar with you?

93
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Japanese do business like this.

94
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
They're familiar with each other.

95
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
You can't care about their money.

96
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
The room is so big.

97
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
Look where you're sleeping.

98
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Why is there no bed?

99
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
What did you say?

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Why is there no bed?

101
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Japanese live in this weird way.

102
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
The room is small.

103
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
They sleep on the floor.

104
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
You can sleep anywhere you want.

105
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
You can sleep in the cabinet.

106
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
You sleep in the room.

107
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
I sleep in the room.

108
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Go to bed.

109
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Go to bed.

110
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
You can cook here.

111
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
I have to tell you the truth.

112
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
I believe that there should be no problem with the rent for three months.

113
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
If you continue to do that, you will be able to see it.

114
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
We will naturally be able to pass the contract.

115
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
We will be able to save some money.

116
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
I will try not to let you stay on the street.

117
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Two netizens can have such conditions.

118
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
It's heaven already. Don't you think so?

119
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,760
So, I became your burden?

120
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
A beautiful burden.

121
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

122
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
I don't believe that the winter is so big.

123
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
It won't be easy for me.

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
It's good that you can think like that.

125
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,760
The sea is over the moon. The sky is high. The birds are flying.

126
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Let's fly and see.

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
You go and pack up.

128
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I will go to the street with my old friend.

129
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
They don't know that I am coming to the winter.

130
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
You are so silly.

131
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I don't have any feelings for you.

132
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
You can't be so silly.

133
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Dad.

134
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Mom.

135
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Sister.

136
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Why am I so silly?

137
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,760
I'm so stupid.

138
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
I'm so stupid.

139
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I'm so stupid.

140
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Mr. He.

141
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Mr. He.

142
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
What did you say?

143
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Mr. He,

144
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
I'm so sorry.

145
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Mr. He.

146
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Did you hear that?

147
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Are you okay?

148
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Did something happen?

149
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
What did you say?

150
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I can't understand Japanese at all.

151
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Did something happen?

152
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Are you okay?

153
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
I can't understand Japanese at all.

154
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
I'm so sorry.

155
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Are you okay?

156
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Please wait a minute.

157
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Someone!

158
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Someone!

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Can you hear me?

160
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Can you hear me?

161
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Please help me.

162
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Please help me.

163
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Wait a minute.

164
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
What did you say?

165
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Hello.

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Excuse me,

167
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
can I ask you something?

168
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

169
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I'm not.

170
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
I'm saying that you're not feeling well.

171
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
It's a matter of time.

172
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
You should stop.

173
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Please stay with us.

174
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Please.

175
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Please tell me if you're in trouble.

176
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
You don't have to be polite.

177
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Mr. Yu used to live here.

178
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
He's an old client.

179
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
You can just tell me if you're in trouble.

180
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Do you know

181
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,760
where there's a selling place?

182
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
That's it.

183
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
That's a small place.

184
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Yes.

185
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
It's a famous place.

186
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I'll take you to the market.

187
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
It's convenient.

188
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
I'm also open to people.

189
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
But I'm not happy.

190
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
I can't take your money.

191
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
What did you say?

192
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I don't want to hear that.

193
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,760
I'm really worried about that.

194
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,760
I've been a teacher for three years.

195
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
So I'm not happy.

196
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Please don't say that.

197
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
It's okay.

198
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
It's okay.

199
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
It's okay.

200
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Thank you.

201
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
You're welcome.

202
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Thank you.

203
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
You're back.

204
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm just a friend who's been living here for a long time.

205
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,760
I'm so happy to see you.

206
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,760
How about...

207
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,760
you can quit abusing the company

208
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
to spread two ver 2002,

209
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
then continue to beg another company.

210
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,760
With the reputation by 98%.

211
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Your sister would risk a lot of money

212
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,760
and so would the resources of your jewel law group.

213
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
she-ma!

214
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
It's Mom!

215
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
I can live a hard life.

216
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
This is just the beginning.

217
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I told you that I have been to the police station.

218
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,760
But I don't know how I will live my life.

219
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Except for those officials,

220
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
they lack money from the Chinese people.

221
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
When I go out, I have no money.

222
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
I have no money.

223
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
I don't know how they will get married.

224
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Go to sleep.

225
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Oh, no.

226
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
You are right.

227
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,760
I am a silly girl who comes from a small place.

228
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,760
I don't know how I will get to the big place in the winter.

229
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
I have no mother, no family.

230
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
It's nothing.

231
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
I am proud of you.

232
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
I am a family that I am living in peace.

233
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
How can I get this?

234
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
They are two girls.

235
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
They are ashamed of them.

236
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
They are like a wind.

237
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
They are like a mess.

238
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
They are so drunk.

239
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
They are so rude and rude.

240
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
They are so mean.

241
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
I can't think of anything.

242
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
How can you not think?

243
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
You and I are not the same.

244
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
You and Yu Tianba.

245
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
We are so close.

246
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
You want to save the country.

247
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
You want to create history.

248
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,760
And we are so clever.

249
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
What do you want to do?

250
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
What can you do?

251
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
What is the education my parents taught me?

252
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
What is the purpose of life?

253
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
It's actually very simple.

254
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
You are a good person.

255
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
You are a filial son.

256
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Your neighbors will praise you.

257
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
That's so nice.

258
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
But now,

259
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
my parents can still get the praise of the neighbors.

260
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
I have to think about it.

261
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Now the neighbors are watching my movie.

262
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Why do you have the praise?

263
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I am really sorry.

264
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
I can't.

265
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
I can't.

266
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
I can't.

267
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
I can't.

268
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
I can't.

269
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
I can't.

270
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
I can't.

271
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
I can't.

272
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
I can't see you.

273
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
I am not happy.

274
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
Indeed.

275
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,640
Thank you.

276
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,440
Thank you.

277
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,440
73. 74.75.

278
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,840
And my right?

279
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,680
My left?

280
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
What does it mean?

281
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,080
I paper, paper.

282
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,080
I'm going to make it easy.

283
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
This is?

284
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Yes.

285
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Don't move.

286
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Stand up.

287
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Stand up.

288
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Good.

289
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
I'm going to do it.

290
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
I'm going to do it.

291
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
I'm going to do it.

292
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
5.1

293
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
Next.

294
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Hurry up.

295
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm going to do it.

296
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
God.

297
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
How many ghosts have we become?

298
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Liang Xiang, you know what?

299
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
You wear the same thing.

300
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
You look like a noble.

301
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
What do you mean?

302
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
People are like that.

303
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
What are you talking about?

304
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,080
A noble doesn't let people see everything.

305
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
I'm going to do it.

306
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Go.

307
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,080
The main course is the first course of your instruction.

308
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Today, the main course is the first course of your instruction.

309
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,080
I'll take you to the institute.

310
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,080
I, the first class, will be your responsibility.

311
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,080
I'll represent the school and teach you the responsibility.

312
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Why do you call it responsibility?

313
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Because you're not a formal student.

314
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Can you be a formal teacher in Japan?

315
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,080
I'll teach you the performance in the next half a year.

316
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
In the next half a year,

317
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
you'll be studying here.

318
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Then you'll be at the academy.

319
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,080
After that, you'll be able to enter the school.

320
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,080
The academy is the golden law of Japan.

321
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,080
Everything he's taught is what you have to do.

322
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,080
In that case, you don't have to teach your teacher the responsibility.

323
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,080
You have to teach your teacher the responsibility.

324
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
When I was a kid,

325
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,080
I wanted to teach you the same thing as the president of the United Nations.

326
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,080
Remember, teach the same thing as the president of the United Nations.

327
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:31,080
You'll be able to complete the same thing as the president of the United Nations.

328
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
No matter where you come from,

329
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,080
or where you come from,

330
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
you'll only have one car.

331
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
A train.

332
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
And I,

333
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,080
I only trust the people between you and the school.

334
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Understood?

335
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Yes.

336
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Thank you.

337
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,080
What's your name?

338
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Shin Sen?

339
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,080
I don't sell Shin Sen.

340
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
I want this, Shin Sen?

341
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Don't touch my finger.

342
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
It's a dangerous way to cut it.

343
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Go away.

344
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
I'll make it cheap.

345
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,080
It's the first time I've ever bought meat.

346
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
It's a face that everyone can't see.

347
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Chinese people believe in their own skin.

348
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,080
I have a flower.

349
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
I don't want a flower.

350
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,080
I want to be a good person.

351
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Li Ji.

352
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Li Ji.

353
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Please be careful.

354
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
What's wrong with you?

356
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
You're too reckless.

357
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
I never believe in those Western newspapers.

358
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Never.

359
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
No matter if you believe it or not,

360
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
you've been officially reckless in Shanghai.

361
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
It's meaningless.

362
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
You helped Prince Chun Qimang.

363
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
You're a piece of cake.

364
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Tian Bai, we only want to make a promise.

365
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
I'm telling the truth.

366
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
He's still a spy.

367
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Even if he's a Chinese,

368
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,080
he's still a red-banded spy.

369
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
You're so stupid.

370
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Tian Bai, I'm asking you.

371
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
In the book,

372
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
the foreign king's death is not known.

373
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
The German style of the wind

374
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,080
is also considered a spy in the West.

375
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Even if it's like that,

376
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
it's not a good thing.

377
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Only the government of Hong Xiaozhi's Bureau

378
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,080
suddenly made a suspicion about Chinese people.

379
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Is it a good thing?

380
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
It's about to be broken.

381
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
If you keep talking nonsense,

382
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
will you be okay?

383
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
I hope that the quality and talent of the wind

384
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
that he's over-explanating

385
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
will be as good as the Great Qing.

386
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
I hope that he'll have a new hope.

387
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Such propaganda

388
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
is clearly the cause of the West's fall.

389
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
It's useless.

390
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Can't you see it?

391
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Tian Bai,

392
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
is this beef red or white?

393
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Of course, it's red.

394
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Only a red-banded beef like this can be red.

395
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
You have to blow the sauce in the oil pan,

396
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
and then put the onion, ginger, garlic, and garlic

397
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
in the last beef, you know?

398
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
I've told you many times.

399
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Only the living can be the master.

400
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
I don't believe in the West's fall.

401
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
I never believe it.

402
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
No matter if you believe it or not,

403
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
it's a big problem for us.

404
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
It's too much.

405
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Master.

406
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Master.

407
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Yes.

408
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
What's wrong?

409
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
I'm sorry, but

410
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
you're my master.

411
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
I don't want to forgive you

412
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
for doing this to me.

413
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,080
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
I don't want to forgive you for doing this,

420
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,080
but I have other guests.

421
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Please be quiet.

422
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,080
If the teachers' rooms are too noisy,

423
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
they'll be angry at other guests.

424
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
The smoke is already out,

425
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
and it's already flowing out, right?

426
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
And the oil that was heated up,

427
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
the room was so dirty.

428
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
I don't know what to do.

429
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Qiu Hong,

430
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
please don't cook.

431
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
What about lunch?

432
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Didn't you buy vegetables?

433
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Eat vegetables and salad.

434
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
I won't cook vegetables and salad.

435
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Then

436
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
I'll ask the teacher.

437
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Right now?

438
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
That's good.

439
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
The teacher is new.

440
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
She's been cooking with me.

441
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
But the first month

442
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
she didn't give me anything.

443
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
This month is so hard.

444
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
If the teacher did,

445
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
I understand.

446
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
I believe in you.

447
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Well,

448
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
let's do that.

449
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Our meal time is

450
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
10 yen per month for one person.

451
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
It's 20 yen for two people.

452
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Please come with your parents next month.

453
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Thank you.

454
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
What did she say?

455
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
20 yen a month?

456
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
It's too expensive.

457
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,080
Don't worry about it.

458
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Eat her.

459
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Let's go.

460
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Hurry.

461
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Liu Qing.

462
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Liu Qing.

463
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
You two,

464
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
are you here to visit?

465
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
No.

466
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
I said you were so ugly.

467
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
How could you be ugly?

468
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
The Japanese are not the same as the Japanese.

469
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
What's wrong with them?

470
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
You two

471
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
have the time to show your skills.

472
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
It's not the day of the week.

473
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
You don't let your team go.

474
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
I let them go.

475
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
I'm not going to let them go.

476
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
I'm not going to let them go.

477
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
I'm not going to let them go.

478
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Let them go.

479
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
But these guys

480
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
can't stand it for a day.

481
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
It's been three months.

482
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
You're so honest.

483
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Uncle is here to learn military skills.

484
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
He came here to learn this.

485
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Where can I go with Kai?

486
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
One is to clean the dishes.

487
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
The other is to burn the fire in the morning.

488
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
We are called officials.

489
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
How can his mother treat us so well?

490
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
We are here to ask for you.

491
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
We will meet the leader of the team.

492
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
He can't treat us like a treat.

493
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
I'm not going.

494
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
I want to go with you.

495
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Go.

496
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Anyway, go.

497
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
Come on.

498
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Yuan Qing,

499
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
we are together.

500
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Right.

501
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Right.

502
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
We are together.

503
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
What are you talking about?

504
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
I didn't say you.

505
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
I said they.

506
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
These people

507
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
only understand Japanese.

508
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Eat.

509
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Don't be polite.

510
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
I said you didn't wash your hands.

511
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
You just feed the pigs and feed us.

512
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Don't talk about it.

513
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
There are people in the world.

514
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Just that half of the wood.

515
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
I have to buy 500 pounds a day.

516
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
It's like a small mountain.

517
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
I'm not satisfied with the mountain.

518
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
You two have a technique.

519
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,080
You go to the team every day.

520
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
It's not a walk.

521
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
It's a new experience for us.

522
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Qiu Ying, let's play this game.

523
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
Do you know what this is?

524
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
This is called a consistent training.

525
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
You can't do it.

526
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
You just don't work hard enough.

527
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Don't drink.

528
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
The team has a problem.

529
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Drink while inside.

530
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
What are you afraid of?

531
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
We are not here to steal.

532
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
What are you afraid of?

533
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Yang Xiang, do you think you are the royal family?

534
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
That's not true.

535
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
That's right.

536
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
I tell you, when we go to the leader again,

537
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
you have to speak.

538
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
You have to let him know who you are.

539
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
That's right.

540
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,080
He is so forgetful about us.

541
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
You can't do that.

542
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
You can't do that.

543
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
The mood of the Chinese emperor.

544
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
Let you feed pigs.

545
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
It's obviously humiliating you.

546
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
It's humiliating you.

547
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
It's humiliating our China.

548
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Is it, Brother Qian?

549
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
That's right.

550
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Right?

551
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Is it, Brother Qian?

552
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
I told you to stop drinking.

553
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Stop drinking.

554
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Hurry up.

555
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Hurry up.

556
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Don't come back.

557
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Go out.

558
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Hurry up.

559
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Go out.

560
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
Go out.

561
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Go out.

562
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Go out.

563
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
There is more.

564
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
I am reporting.

565
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
The imperial army has completed the investigation

566
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
of the two of us.

567
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
At the same time,

568
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
the two of us have completed the investigation

569
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
of the two of us.

570
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
You idiot.

571
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Go out.

572
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Go out.

573
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Go out.

574
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
Go out.

575
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Go out.

576
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Go out.

577
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Go out.

578
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Go out.

579
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Stop fighting.

580
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Stop fighting.

581
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Stop talking to me.

582
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Stop fighting.

583
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Go out.

584
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Go out.

585
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
Go out.

586
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Sit down.

587
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Sit down.

588
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Sit down.

589
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
Go out.

590
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Go out.

591
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Don't be angry.

592
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
I will let him get the gun.

593
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
I will let him get the gun.

594
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Go out.

595
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Go out.

596
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Go out.

597
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Go out.

598
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
Go out.

599
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
Go out.

600
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Go out.

601
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
The imperial army.

602
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
It's over.

603
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
It's hot.

604
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
It's hot.

605
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
It's hot.

606
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
It's hot.

607
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
entrar.

608
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,080
More force.

609
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,080
More force.

610
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,300
Wait here!

611
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,060
How would they need an ID card?

612
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,240
Well...

613
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,540
Hey!

614
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,460
Exactly!

615
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,120
Jaeger ground!

616
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,840
No one's here!

617
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,620
Oh how rude of you!

618
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,320
Come on!

619
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,360
I can't believe this...

620
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,740
Thu did bring you in.

621
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,740
You are so fierce in the team.

622
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,340
You are so stubborn.

623
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
You are like a cat.

624
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,740
Why do you want to be stubborn?

625
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,740
Then why did you come here to play with me?

626
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,740
I guess it's a bad thing.

627
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
I've been in the stomach for too long.

628
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
You just put a fart and then you get into trouble.

629
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,740
Is it a trap?

630
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,740
But you really can play with Li.

631
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,740
You jump and you fly.

632
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
You are so beautiful.

633
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,740
You are on the bottom of the mountain.

634
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,740
You fall and you are in a bad mood.

635
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,740
The map of the mountain is the best in the team.

636
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,740
You are so good at playing.

637
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,740
You are so good at playing.

638
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,740
You are so good at playing.

639
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,740
What is this?

640
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
It's a human iPhone.

641
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
You are not here.

642
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,740
We won't do anything.

643
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
We have been here for three months.

644
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,740
But you are here.

645
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,740
I am on the bottom of the mountain.

646
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,740
Look at this.

647
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
Is it hot?

648
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,740
It's still hot now.

649
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,740
It's really hard to play.

650
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,740
I am so tired.

651
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
You are so bad.

652
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,740
We have no time to worry about you.

653
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,740
We have no time to worry about you.

654
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,740
Get out of here.

655
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
You are so beautiful.

656
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,740
You can beat your students.

657
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,740
You can beat them.

658
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
You can beat them.

659
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,740
You can beat them.

660
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,740
We are here to fight the Chinese people.

661
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,740
We are here to fight the Chinese people.

662
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Be careful.

663
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,740
Don't bring the car that you are in between us.

664
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,740
The people here are more careful than the army.

665
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
If the army doesn't stop the pigs,

666
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,740
how can we bring the pigs to the mine?

667
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:37,740
The high school students are not allowed to bring the pigs.

668
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,740
We are not allowed to do anything.

669
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,740
But we will do our best to bring them to the mine.

670
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,740
We will not let them come to the sea.

671
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,740
Yokaro, accept that proposal.

672
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,740
But first, if the Chinese people apologize again,

673
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,740
we will do the same thing as the first class.

674
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,740
You have no objection.

675
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
By the way,

676
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,740
would you like to meet the three students?

677
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Would you like to meet the three students?

678
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,740
I will not let them meet.

679
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,740
We don't need to talk about our opinions to the Chinese.

680
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,740
I will go first.

681
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,740
Excuse me.

682
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,740
I miss you, Brother Tian.

683
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,740
I have done everything.

684
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,740
I can't come back.

685
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
I mean,

686
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,740
I am a man of my word.

687
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,740
I don't know who I am.

688
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,740
I always see the people here.

689
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
Do you know who he is?

690
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,740
I don't know.

691
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,740
He is the one who makes people look down on me.

692
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
You are so blind.

693
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,740
What if we really start?

694
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,740
What should we do?

695
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,740
You are so sorry to him.

696
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,740
He chose me personally.

697
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Don't talk about you.

698
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,740
If I was really blind,

699
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,740
I would not be able to communicate.

700
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,740
You have to think of a way.

701
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,740
If we really start,

702
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,740
nothing will come.

703
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,740
Slow down.

704
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,740
I have a little grudge.

705
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
One thousand days?

706
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,740
You are so rich.

707
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,740
You are so famous.

708
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,740
I have a grudge.

709
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,740
How about we go back to the company?

710
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,740
One thousand days is not enough.

711
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,740
We will lose the reputation of our country.

712
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,740
I think it is enough.

713
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,740
The money is not clean.

714
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,740
Why not clean?

715
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,740
If we don't clean,

716
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
we will clean up the money.

717
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
Why not clean?

718
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,740
You are so rich.

719
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
How much money can you earn?

720
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,740
Why clean up?

721
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
You are talking about me.

722
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,740
Why clean up?

723
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,740
Don't make a fuss.

724
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,740
Who is it?

725
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,740
Who is coming?

726
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,740
Be quiet.

727
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
The police are here.

728
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
Open the door.

729
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
Open the door.

730
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,740
Open the door.

731
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,740
Open the door.

732
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,740
Lieutenant,

733
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
you are not even rich.

734
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,740
What is it that you do when you do something?

735
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,740
Do you know how this will end?

736
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
I am being careful.

737
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,740
Why did you do something on your own?

738
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,740
I have made a mistake.

739
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,740
I want to make this mistake happen to my family.

740
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,740
Family members?

741
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,740
Yes.

742
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Please listen to me.

743
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
I have made a mistake.

744
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,740
I am the head of the Japanese government.

745
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,740
What is that?

746
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,740
It is a Japanese-style Ayakura.

747
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,740
Ayakura?

748
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,740
Yes.

749
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,740
Ayakura,

750
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,740
welcome.

751
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,740
I am the head of the Japanese government.

752
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:16,740
I am just here to meet my Chinese student as a high school student.

753
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,740
I am the head of the Japanese government.

754
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
Welcome, child.

755
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Let's go in.

756
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,740
This is my wife.

757
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,740
She is my little daughter, Fanzi.

758
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Do you know where the customer is?

759
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,740
He is not with us except for the long three friends.

760
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,740
I am sorry, but he knows Japanese.

761
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,740
Yes, right, Ran-chan?

762
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
Just a little.

763
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,740
This customer is a rich man from the financial department.

764
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,740
He is a rich man from the financial department.

765
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,740
He is a rich man from the financial department.

766
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,740
I am sorry for the poor food.

767
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
I understand.

768
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,740
Let's go in.

769
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,740
I am a teacher from the financial department.

770
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,740
I am a Japanese-style Japanese student from Gensinian.

771
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,740
I am a teacher from the financial department.

772
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,740
I bought the noodles.

773
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,740
All the kitchenware here is a little bit expensive.

774
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,740
I am sorry for the poor food.

775
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,740
I am sorry for the poor food.

776
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,740
I am sorry for the poor food.

777
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,740
Is he a Chinese school student?

778
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,740
Yes, I heard that.

779
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,740
If you cut the three friends, it will be more beautiful.

780
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
Don't you know that?

781
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,740
I know.

782
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,740
I am sorry.

783
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,740
Come in.

784
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,740
I am sorry.

785
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,740
Come on, eat.

786
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,740
Just eat.

787
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,740
This is your home.

788
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,740
In the Japanese team,

789
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,740
we must not be easy to deal with.

790
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,740
Especially the most important thing in the world.

791
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,740
I am sorry.

792
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,740
The Japanese team is like a family.

793
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,740
They do everything themselves.

794
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,740
They are absolutely responsible for the order.

795
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,740
Even if it is not a competition,

796
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,740
it is not a forbidden order.

797
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,740
Maybe you think that

798
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,740
not everyone will be able to exercise.

799
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,740
You will ask why you don't have money.

800
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,740
You have to listen carefully.

801
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,740
Only after understanding will you remember.

802
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,740
The Japanese team has no explanation.

803
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,740
You have to understand what the Japanese team is.

804
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,740
Only after that,

805
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,740
you can see all its professionalism.

806
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,740
Including the order,

807
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,740
the order and the so-called

808
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,740
the most authentic and stable.

809
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,740
I am sorry.

810
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
I am sorry.

811
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,740
I am sorry.

812
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
I am sorry.

813
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,740
I am sorry.

814
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,740
I am sorry.
