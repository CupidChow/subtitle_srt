It seems I won't be looking after you anymore.

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,800
Principal, please spare me this time.

48
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
It's really neglecting your studies, principal.

49
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,000
Teacher

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,640

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
Everyone, listen up!

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,120
Change your clothes!

59
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,040
Sir!

60
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Sir!

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
How do we deal with this change?

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,560
How do we deal with this change?

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,400
Hey!

64
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,520
What's the seven-star deal?

65
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,880
Can I go home?

66
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,200
I've made it clear.

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,760
How to deal with it is your own business.

68
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,040
Do you understand?

69
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,840
Don't be so stubborn with me.

70
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,120
You're a good husband.

71
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,560
That's the most important thing.

72
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,760
I don't believe it.

73
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,880
You still have to use this broken rope

74
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
to keep the number.

75
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,240
All right.

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,880
Everyone, listen up!

77
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,520
Change your clothes!

78
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,440
Get ready to go to the classroom!

79
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,200
Get ready to go to the classroom!

80
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,200
Everyone, listen up!

81
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,960
Change your clothes!

82
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,920
Get ready to go to the classroom!

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,400
Did they receive Darling Governing

84
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,640
Here?

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,720
You're a took Don too?

86
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,840
Yes, that's right.

87
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Your classmate, Yang Kai Zhi.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,960
You should wear this uniform.

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,520
You're from Yang Ai.

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Do we know each other?

91
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,560
You're so smart.

92
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,280
In the capital,

93
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,040
who took you back to the city?

94
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,840
I remember.

95
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,560
You're that weirdo.

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
I remember your uncle's head-cutting.

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,400
You're so capable.

98
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
You're so naive.

99
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,200
I thought you were a young master

100
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,440
from Shanghai.

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm just lucky.

102
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,960
Tell me, where's Captain?

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
I'm here to report.

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,760
You're right.

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,000
No.

106
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,480
How did you get the name?

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,080
I'm lucky.

108
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,880
Xue Erliangxiang.

109
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,320
What's going on?

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Who is he?

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,720
He's the one you're looking for.

112
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
He's a member of the team.

113
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,320
Don't say I know him.

114
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm here to find him.

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
What's going on?

116
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,520
Who are you?

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm Yang Kai Zhi.

118
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm from Liu Kun Yi, the capital of Liangjiang.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm here to report.

120
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,940
Liu Kun Yi's snapped him.

121
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,000
Chief Regent...

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
Looks good to look at.

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
Yeah, and皮 ayaf.

124
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,680
What's on your mind, now?

125
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,840
Do you know him?

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
He and I...

127
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,080
I don't?

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,520
Absolutely!

129
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,840
Sheng Yuan and Liang Xiang.

131
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Xue Sheng is here.

132
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
You should do what you should do.

133
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,640
Don't be here.

134
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,840
Go now.

135
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
Understood.

136
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Officer.

137
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,240
You are Yang Kai Zhi, right?

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,240
It seems that you are a bit of a scholar.

139
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Tell me.

140
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,640
How did you get in touch with Director Liu?

141
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,240
Sheng Yuan and Director Liu are very close.

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Stop it.

143
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,240
You are a very close friend.

144
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
If you have any relationship,

145
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
you can stay here.

146
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,840
This is the payment for the exhibition.

147
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
This is the decoration.

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,840
This is the gift for the dress.

149
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,840
Take it and sign here.

150
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Where is the tuition fee?

151
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,040
Isn't there a tuition fee?

152
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,640
What's your name?

153
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Officer Hu,

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,840
Sheng Yuan is a famous person.

155
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,240
He is from the thousand-year-old military service.

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,440
He is a soldier from the Japanese military service.

157
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
He is done.

158
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,440
He is from Yuan Shikai.

159
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
No wonder he is so trained.

160
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Officer Hu,

161
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
since the war,

162
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,840
every soldier and soldier

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
has been in the hands of the Commander.

164
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
They have never been in the middle.

165
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,240
So, we have never been in the middle.

166
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,840
Nobody wants to deduct your award.

167
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Your tuition fee will be paid with a tax.

168
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,040
You will be in the East Jing school in the evening.

169
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
Do you understand?

170
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Yes.

171
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
Sign here.

172
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Next.

173
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,640
Sheng Yuan Hu Maichen,

174
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,440
Shandong District,

175
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,040
Sheng Yuan Hao, 027.

176
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,840
You think I am a good person?

177
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,240
You ask me?

178
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
Can't I ask?

179
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,040
What do you think?

180
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I thought that

181
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,240
I was uncomfortable with this dress.

182
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Of course.

183
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
But,

184
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,440
I feel so uncomfortable

185
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,640
when I wear it.

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
That's right.

187
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,440
No one recognizes you.

188
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,440
What's wrong with me?

189
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,640
You are so young.

190
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,040
Don't think you have any secrets.

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Listen,

192
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
you are in danger now.

193
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,640
You are in danger?

194
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,840
This is our room, isn't it?

195
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,640
The Commander asked me to fight with you.

196
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
My name is Li Renjun.

197
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,440
I am from Qianli.

198
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,640
I am from the army of the five guards.

199
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,840
I am so anxious.

200
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,640
You think I am like you.

201
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,840
The person from Yuan?

202
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Yes.

203
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,840
The person from Yuan jumped from the 1000th rank.

204
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,440
What does he know?

205
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,840
Then, we don't know him.

206
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,640
The Commander said that he is from the imperial family.

207
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,040
He came from Jingzhou.

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,640
He is from the imperial family?

209
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,440
Yes.

210
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,640
How many people are in the royal family?

211
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
The Royal Father and the Regent?

212
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,440
I told you.

213
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,240
Why are you so anxious?

214
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
You are so weak.

215
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,040
What Royal Father and the Regent?

216
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,440
You are so tired.

217
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
You are so tired.

218
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,040
More than 200 years ago,

219
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
who is serious?

220
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,640
That's not possible.

221
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,040
What is not possible?

222
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,240
I came to Shanghai and I know

223
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,640
I am a top.

224
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Top?

225
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Who is the top?

226
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,640
The imperial court ordered

227
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,440
to let the noble family of Jincheng

228
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,240
send a person to study abroad.

229
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,640
I am from the Qing Dynasty.

230
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,640
But they think

231
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,240
studying abroad is a terrible thing.

232
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
They don't want to go out

233
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,040
even though they are a little low-ranked.

234
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
So,

235
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,640
they found me from the royal family

236
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
in Jingzhou.

237
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I am a student

238
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,040
who is studying abroad for the Qing Dynasty.

239
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,240
Of course.

240
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,640
I am a student

241
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
who is a good person.

242
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,840
So,

243
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,640
we are all the same.

244
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
We are all men from the world.

245
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,640
Liangxiang,

246
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,040
the capital.

247
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,440
Yang Kaizhi.

248
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,840
Aren't you Yang Ai-guo?

249
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Don't mention it.

250
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,040
Don't mention it anymore.

251
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,440
No.

252
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
I know.

253
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,240
So, you know each other before?

254
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
No.

255
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,640
I don't know each other at all.

256
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
I know each other now.

257
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,240
I know each other now.

258
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
And you.

259
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Li Renjun.

260
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,040
Yuan Gongbao.

261
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,440
The red man of Mr. Yuan.

262
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,140
Mr. Yuan?

263
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Mr. Yuan.

264
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,340
Here is a seminary text from Zhao Cold糖孩子.

265
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,540
Mr. ,

266
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,440
book reference from Zhao Better xiao yan.

267
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,100
I can't keep thinking about it.

268
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,460
Can you remember to wash300 wells andoooo?

269
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,300
The tap water in your grand-規 dad's shed.

270
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,460
My diagnosed grandchild!

271
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,880
Why didn't you give her a tattoo on your hands?!

272
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,160
They let me respect your grandchild, indeed.

273
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,440
Lanxi. What are you doing? Hurry up.

274
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,120
My grandchild!

275
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,880
Do you really remember me?!

276
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Your mother's voice and voice are all under my control.

277
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
I remember that you...

278
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Don't go. You're the little uncle's classmate.

279
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
That's my father-in-law.

280
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I've already called Zhou Jiuxi in Lao Zheng. Let's go together.

281
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Give me a hand.

282
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
But...

283
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Father-in-law is an ordinary officer of the outside world.

284
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
He's in the Shenzhen Police Station.

285
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Father-in-law is not an outsider. Let's go together.

286
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Go in.

287
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm going to thank my husband later.

288
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
I'm really sorry.

289
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Why did you give me a break?

290
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:33,880
According to the Prince's follow-up, Yin Changshuo used to ask Prince Chun to be more careful.

291
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Careful?

292
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Prince deliberately left this impression to the Shanghai people.

293
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,880
After all, it's not a matter of light.

294
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
I'm so worried.

295
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,880
The royal family also wants to see him.

296
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Since the royal family left the Qing Dynasty, there has been no such thing as a new start.

297
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
It's time to tell the truth.

298
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Who said it's not true?

299
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,880
It's not easy for the royal family to come to Shanghai.

300
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,880
The Shanghai people don't want to see him.

301
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
So, Brother Daren,

302
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,880
the late night of the last meeting must invite the Prince.

303
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,880
The Prince also wants to see all the leaders.

304
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
We must also let the news of the wedding be spread.

305
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
I've already made a plan.

306
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,880
The Prince's rumors are set to be on the 20th.

307
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,880
There will be four days left in Shanghai.

308
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Okay.

309
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Your Highness.

310
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Your Highness.

311
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Look.

312
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,880
The dress is so gorgeous.

313
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Did you record it?

314
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
I did.

315
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
I recorded it.

316
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
The official fee is the same as the military life.

317
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Okay.

318
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Sit.

319
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Sit.

320
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
It's okay, Qiu Hong.

321
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
A Le Yi family doesn't talk about two families.

322
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
As long as it's the family's boat, it's all right.

323
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm here to say hello.

324
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,880
My brother-in-law needs someone to help him.

325
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
I have to help him for a few days.

326
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
I'll leave first.

327
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
The old man has a guest.

328
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Why don't we wait for him first?

329
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
I'll leave first.

330
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Take care.

331
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
See you.

332
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Who is it?

333
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Who do you think it is?

334
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,880
It's your third daughter-in-law who is in the house of An Qing.

335
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Song Chen has already got married.

336
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Look at your Song family.

337
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
They are both big and small.

338
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
They are all so ambitious.

339
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
It's so annoying that your husband

340
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
can't find a way out.

341
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Don't worry.

342
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
I'll pay you two thousand yuan.

343
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Two thousand?

344
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Two thousand?

345
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Song Ren.

346
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Don't ask so many things in the family.

347
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
It's here.

348
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Thank you.

349
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Tian Bai.

350
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
You are a tough guy.

351
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
What do you mean?

352
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
You are so ungrateful.

353
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm not.

354
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
You are kidding me.

355
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Yifan.

356
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
I'm a person like that.

357
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Tell me.

358
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Prince Chun is very strict with his wife.

359
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
He is hard to get close to.

360
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
If you want to kill him

361
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
under the light, it's even more difficult.

362
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
If you don't want to do it with me,

363
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
then don't do it.

364
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I'll find someone else.

365
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Qiu Hong.

366
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Qiu Hong.

367
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Come in.

368
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Let me introduce a few people to you.

369
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
Are they foreigners?

370
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
No, they are not.

371
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
They are the shareholders of our school.

372
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Why don't they have a change?

373
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Shanghai is not quiet.

374
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
The west is open to the people.

375
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
When the students come back,

376
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
they will see the change.

377
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Aren't you afraid of the government's killings?

378
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Although the court is in charge of the three-leafed sword,

379
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
now no one can control it.

380
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
It's been a long time.

381
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
No one can control it.

382
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Oh, right.

383
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
They think your idea is very good.

384
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
They are already worried.

385
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
All the girls who can come tomorrow will come.

386
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
First, have a class.

387
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Then, find a newspaper

388
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
and write two news.

389
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
It's a big deal.

390
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Come on, come in.

391
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
You are a man.

392
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
I'm not going in.

393
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I have to go back and pack my things.

394
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
This old Zheng Qing,

395
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,880
can be said to be a few decades old shop.

396
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
He has a long history.

397
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
He is a year away from his comrades.

398
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
This is too much.

399
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Put it here, put it here.

400
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Come, come, come.

401
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Have a taste, have a taste.

402
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Have a taste.

403
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
The fish is transparent.

404
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
It's not slippery.

405
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
It's not slippery.

406
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
It's not slippery.

407
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
It's not slippery.

408
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
It's not slippery.

409
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
It's not slippery.

410
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
It's not slippery.

411
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
It's not slippery.

412
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
It's not slippery.

413
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
It's not slippery.

414
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
It's a traditional old Zheng Qing dish.

415
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
It's a good dish for your stomach.

416
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
It's a good dish for your stomach.

417
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
It's a good dish for your stomach.

418
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Right?

419
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
It's a good dish for your stomach.

420
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Go,

421
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
give your boss a drink.

422
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Give your boss a drink.

423
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
I'll teach you how to cook.

424
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
I'll teach you how to cook.

425
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
It's not necessary.

426
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Don't call me.

427
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
De Liu,

428
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
you can eat it yourself.

429
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
Eat, eat, eat.

430
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I'll teach you.

431
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
De Liu,

432
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
you can eat it yourself.

433
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
I'll teach you.

434
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
I'll teach you.

435
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I'll teach you.

436
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
It's not slippery.

437
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
It's not slippery.

438
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
It's not slippery.

439
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,880
The fish is called the King of the Five Kingdoms.

440
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
It's called the King of the Five Kingdoms.

441
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
The price is too high.

442
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
This old Zheng Qing

443
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,880
has her own dish every year.

444
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Spring comes,

445
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
the day comes.

446
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
It's going to rain in the summer,

447
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm here to wash.

448
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Xiao Yan, you are...

449
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Now you are really a big student.

450
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
This...

451
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
If I live here, I will have to teach you.

452
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
I'm here to wash. Xiao Yan, you are unhappy.

453
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm not unhappy.

454
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
What are you talking about?

455
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
By the way, now you are here to wash.

456
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
It's because the two of you are falling off the root.

457
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
You are all over the place, right?

458
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Xiao Yan, I...

459
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Tuang, don't be so serious about the table.

460
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm also happy to see you, right?

461
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Right, right, right.

462
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Xiao Yan, come, come, come.

463
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
I'll... I'll... I'll...

464
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I'll buy it.

465
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
My little grandpa.

466
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
I have to be a good person, right?

467
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
My little life is your grandfather's

468
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
who picked it up from the dead.

469
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Can I forget it?

470
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
He can't use it.

471
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Okay, okay.

472
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
He can't use it.

473
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Xiao Yan, do you want to meet the king?

474
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
If you want, I'll arrange it.

475
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Why should I meet him? I don't know him.

476
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
That's why you have to recognize him.

477
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,880
The bloodline between you two is to let him lie down.

478
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
If you meet him, he will recognize you.

479
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Why are you here to wash?

480
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
You are so lazy.

481
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
My little grandpa.

482
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
This is not a idle business.

483
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
You are now in military service.

484
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
That's the official position.

485
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
If you go to the official position,

486
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
you will have internal and external affairs.

487
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
You will need to be more advanced,

488
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
more mature, more common, and more angry.

489
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Otherwise, this life will be killed.

490
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
He is a big soldier.

491
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Can you see it?

492
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Right, right?

493
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Yes, yes, yes.

494
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Besides, after you are eight-headed,

495
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,880
you can't be a hero for a lifetime.

496
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Well, how can I meet him?

497
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
The king is following me.

498
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,880
He asked for a horse and a horse ride to my team.

499
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Tomorrow morning, he will arrive at the Yangwu Fish House.

500
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
He will accompany the king to the horse.

501
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Otherwise, you can go with me.

502
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
You know the king.

503
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
At least.

504
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
This is the business.

505
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Can you take me and Brother Kai to the horse?

506
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
I'm afraid it's not possible.

507
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,880
How many people will come to the king?

508
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,880
The king is always with the people.

509
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Only two people are left.

510
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
One is the general of Liangjiang,

511
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Liu Kunyi,

512
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,880
and the other is the northeastern governor of Hu.

513
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Duanfeng.

514
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
It's so bright.

515
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Who are you?

516
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Yang Yifan, from the night school.

517
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Is he really a child?

518
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
No, he is a big boy.

519
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
If you don't,

520
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
he will take out the milk.

521
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,880
My son is not a girl.

522
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
He will take out the milk.

523
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Lu Sayong, Manjindo.

524
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Or I will call her A'Lala.

525
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Who is your son?

526
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
He is a good boy.

527
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
How can I call you?

528
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
My aunt.

529
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
This is your name.

530
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Dad, you don't look like a big boy.

531
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Just say it.

532
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
A'Lala is a good boy.

533
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
She has four daughters in the past.

534
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,880
I'm so happy to have A'Lala.

535
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm very proud of her.

536
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
My brother-in-law calls me aunt.

537
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Just call me aunt.

538
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Why is Mr. Jiao Shu here?

539
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Come on, A'Lala.

540
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
The first one in the class.

541
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Before the class,

542
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,880
the teacher should be polite.

543
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Today's speciality,

544
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
you can have your own etiquette.

545
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I will give you a credit.

546
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Thank you for being here.

547
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
The first class of the school.

548
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
I will tell you.

549
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
What are you talking about?

550
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
I think about it.

551
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
You are all girls.

552
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
You don't have to be so serious.

553
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,880
I will teach you a lesson.

554
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,880
You are all here to study.

555
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,880
The earliest text in the world

556
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,880
is not a book, but a picture.

557
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Let's imagine

558
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,880
a romantic marriage

559
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,880
a million years ago.

560
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
The place is the place of your residence.

561
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,880
A million years ago,

562
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,880
there is still a piece of paper here.

563
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Our ancestors

564
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
took the wooden stick in their hands

565
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
and drew a line on this mud.

566
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,880
It represents the ocean line.

567
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Mountain, river and river.

568
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Then they drew this picture.

569
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Fire chicken.

570
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
We are here now.

571
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,880
We hope we can arrive here tomorrow.

572
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Look.

573
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
What is this?

574
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,880
This is the map of a million years ago.

575
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,880
First class cultured隐藏

576
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Cultured setting

577
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Unofficially.

578
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Anhui, my Lord.

579
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
My Lord.

580
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,880
H-HEY!

581
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,680
Don't move.

582
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,280
My lord.

583
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,080
My lord.

584
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,080
I'll go.

585
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,080
I'll go.

586
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,680
My lord.

587
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,680
So you're Liang Xiang.

588
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
I know you.

589
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
I knew it.

590
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
How's your mother?

591
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,480
She's very good.

592
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
My lord.

593
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
We're the same age.

594
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,880
There should be two immortals.

595
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480
Just like your ancestor.

596
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,680
Is he your ancestor?

597
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,080
Yes.

598
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Our ancestors are all heroes.

599
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,880
They all are batar Elecked of Batolong.

600
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,080
But it's not something

601
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,880
worth washing our cup for.

602
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,880
They are nawning swords...

603
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,160
Of the carrying hand of one hand.

604
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
You're so mean.

605
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,280
You went to Japan to learn military service.

606
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,280
It's good to know one thing.

607
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
That thing.

608
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Please explain it to me.

609
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Why Japanese people love Japanese people?

610
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,280
Why Japanese people love us?

611
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
We don't love them.

612
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
Why Japanese army love us?

613
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Our army doesn't love us.

614
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Jiawu and Mr. Liang.

615
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Japanese army

616
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
represented the elite.

617
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
The same Dongfang people.

618
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
How did they do it?

619
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
They were the elite.

620
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
They had a door.

621
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
You go to find it for me.

622
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,280
We were their teachers since they were young.

623
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
After Jiawu,

624
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
how did they become our teachers?

625
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
This is today's map.

627
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
It was made 50 years ago.

628
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
But it's not accurate.

629
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Why do you say that?

630
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Because here, here and here

631
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
have been divided by the wall.

632
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
For half a century,

633
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,280
China lost a huge mountain of 180,000 square kilometers.

634
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
It's equivalent to three French, five German,

635
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
and seven British.

636
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
And now,

637
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,280
the eight armies are still leading our capital.

638
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I always love the map.

639
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
I love its beauty.

640
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
It's practical.

641
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
It's a good thing.

642
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
With the map,

643
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
you can know where we are.

644
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
You can see the world without spending money.

645
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,280
But now, facing this map,

646
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
do you still love it?

647
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
So, the land

648
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
is actually a fate of the people.

649
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Now, it's very beautiful.

650
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
It's full of blood.

651
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
The land.

652
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Tian Bai, what happened?

653
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
Tian Bai, are you alright?

654
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Tian Bai, I'm alright.

655
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Tian, Tian, Tian, Tian.

656
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
All right, all right, all right.

657
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Don't look.

658
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,680
Don't be so serious. It's just a small matter.

659
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,280
Qiu Hong, help Mr. Yu to clean up.

660
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,880
The rest of you go back to the class.

661
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,480
Come, don't look. Let's go.

662
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,080
Come, let's go to class. Let's continue. Come.

663
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,880
It's really hard for you.

664
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,280
Mr. Yu, you said you didn't do it in the first place.

665
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,480
How scary is that?

666
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
It's just that you're a professional student. I ran down for you, didn't I?

667
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,680
It's hard to avoid. It's a test.

668
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,680
What's the use? I don't know at all.

669
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
What's the use?

670
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,080
I mean, as a student, I have to learn these.

671
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,280
That's too useful.

672
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
How big?

673
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Let me tell you this. This test is full of old-fashioned knowledge.

674
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
It can be said that it doesn't matter.

675
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,480
Do you know what water is?

676
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
What is it?

677
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,680
This is water.

678
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,880
This is water?

679
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,080
This is the chemical expression of water.

680
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Why do you have to say that?

681
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,280
People have to understand the nature of the world.

682
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,080
You have to know what water is.

683
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
Then Yu has been living in water for a lifetime.

684
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,280
Why doesn't he ask what water is?

685
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,480
Then you're not Yu either.

686
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,480
Look.

687
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
This is water.

688
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,480
I'll pour this into the pot.

689
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
When these two substances are fully integrated,

690
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
it will produce different chemical reactions.

691
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Actually, it has been created a new kind of...

692
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
It won't be a bomb, right?

693
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Do you want to do a bomb?

694
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
No, it's okay.

695
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,480
You can immediately see the most touching chemical reaction in the world.

696
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,480
These two substances, as soon as they are combined,

697
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
will instantly trigger the explosion.

698
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
This is the chemical reaction.

699
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
These two substances, as soon as they are combined,

700
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,480
will instantly trigger the explosion.

701
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,480
No, no, no. Don't do that.

702
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
I don't want to be like you.

703
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Okay, then I'll give you a safer way of doing it.

704
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I'll draw a picture for you.

705
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Draw a picture?

706
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Yes.

707
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
This is water, too.

708
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
This is not water.

709
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
But they look the same.

710
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
They're so different.

711
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Someone drew a smile for you.

712
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
I did. My father did.

713
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
He's selling the pen and ink.

714
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Didn't he do that?

715
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Why would he do that?

716
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Your line is very beautiful.

717
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Which line?

718
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
The one in the left.

719
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Look at me.

720
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
The body of a woman

721
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,480
is from the back to the back waist.

722
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
The back waist line

723
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,480
is the most beautiful line in the world.

724
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Can you draw that?

725
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,480
You'll know in a while.

726
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Okay.

727
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
What are you drawing?

728
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Don't be anxious.

729
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
This is my impression of you.

730
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,480
A beautiful, close-knit,

731
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,480
with a flower-like pattern.

732
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
What kind of ink is this?

733
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
It's not a ink.

734
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
It's a chemical product.

735
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
It's a secret ingredient that I invented.

736
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
It's called revolutionary.

737
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Here you are.

738
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Why are you so fierce?

739
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,480
You're like a man.

740
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
You're so calm.

741
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
It's not good.

742
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
It will trigger the fierce.

743
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
When you have a baby,

744
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
even if you have a baby, you won't be able to sing.

745
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
The child's health is not healthy.

746
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
What do you learn?

747
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Of course, you can do the nonsensical life.

748
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Chinese people want to be strong and strong.

749
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,480
First, you have to be healthy.

750
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
How many days is the day after tomorrow?

751
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
But it doesn't mean that

752
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
you can just do it like this.

753
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
You can just do it like this.

754
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
You can just do it like this.

755
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
You can just do it like this.

756
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,480
I've invited a Japanese teacher for you.

757
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Come on.

758
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
So,

759
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
the most basic life language is

760
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
the language of the day.

761
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

762
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,480
You won't even find a good strategy.

763
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
You're really going to make trouble.

764
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
You can even make your friends go up the street.

765
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Okay, I won't say more.

766
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Next, let's welcome the Japanese teacher

767
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
to give us a speech.

768
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Come on.

769
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
You're Liang Xiang.

770
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Hello, everyone.

771
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Yes.

772
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
You don't need to rush to the class.

773
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I have something to tell you.

774
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Come with me.

775
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
I'm Meng Fuchao, a man of Shanghai.

776
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Mr. Meng.

777
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Here's the thing.

778
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,480
Your soldiers are about to be discharged.

779
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,480
The court is very serious.

780
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
It's a great choice.

781
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,480
You're all the future leaders of the country.

782
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You're the most important one.

783
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,480
You're the one who's most favored and favored.

784
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
So,

785
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
I don't have a reason to...

786
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
I believe you.

787
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
This is...

788
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
This is the first love report

789
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,480
we've ever sent you to Shanghai.

790
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Love report?

791
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Why?

792
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,480
The East China Sea is a big country.

793
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,480
You can't avoid

794
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,480
the arrival of each other in the East China Sea.

795
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
Really?

796
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
You don't need to do anything.

797
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
You just need to report to me

798
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
every two months

799
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
about their arrival.

800
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
You're so hard-working.

801
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
What do you think?

802
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Mr. Meng.

803
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,480
You may not know much about our family.

804
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,480
You're not worthy of being

805
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,480
a high-ranking leader like this.

806
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Meng.

807
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I'm going to the clinic.

808
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
I'm late.

809
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Brother-in-law.

810
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480
What are you talking about?

811
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
You're so happy.

812
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
You're in a hurry.

813
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Really?

814
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm calling you.

815
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
You'd better stay away from me.

816
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
What do you mean?

817
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,480
You're a girl from a small place.

818
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
You're still so arrogant.

819
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Where do you want to go?

820
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I'm not going to the clinic.

821
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
What's this?

822
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Nothing.

823
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
The school is a place

824
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
where you can share your thoughts and learn.

825
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Mr. Chen will tell you tomorrow

826
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
what a man and a woman are.

827
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
You're free to marry.

828
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
You're a good boy.

829
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
You're a good boy.

830
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
You should take good care of this moment.

831
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
Which Mr. Chen?

832
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
The real man.

833
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Not good.

834
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
A little bit.

835
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
A little bit.

836
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Sit up.

837
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
What are you doing?

838
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
I'm going to change my clothes.

839
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
So fast.

840
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Qiu Hong, you're so young.

841
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
You're even better than a girl.

842
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Really?

843
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
How can you be so young?

844
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
You're a good boy.

845
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
You're a good boy.

846
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
You're not a bad boy.

847
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
I've been a brother for five years.

848
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
I was a kid.

849
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
I'm still young.

850
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I can't be a good boy.

851
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
You're wearing this.

852
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
No problem.

853
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
You're so old.

854
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
You're so old.

855
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
The marriage of a man and a woman is a good thing.

856
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Men and women are not separated.

857
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
That's why men and women get married.

858
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
And Chinese marriage

859
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,480
is not about men and women getting married.

860
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,480
But others make a strong force for her.

861
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,480
But Chinese people

862
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
are not the same as brothers and sisters.

863
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
One is men and women getting married.

864
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
One is love.

865
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
The one who opens the shop needs a partner.

866
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,480
And two are the same.

867
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Man said that the couple has been together for decades.

868
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,480
But they don't ask about the marriage.

869
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
They force each other.

870
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
They don't have a lover.

871
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
They are not the same as the couple.

872
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
They say that they often get married.

873
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Why?

874
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Because of the relationship between the couple

875
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
or the couple's relationship.

876
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
The relationship between the couple and the couple

877
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
is not long.

878
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
They are not married.

879
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,480
But they are not the same as the couple.

880
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
The marriage of a man and a woman

881
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
is not good.

882
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
I'll write it down.

883
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
The couple

884
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
is 18 years old.

885
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Is that right?

886
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Don't laugh.

887
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,480
The relationship between the couple and the couple is strong.

888
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
It's a big deal.

889
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Sir.

890
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Can you lend me your reward?

891
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Sorry.

892
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
I know the payment.

893
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
I don't need the reward.

894
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,480
You are so nice.

895
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
You are so kind.

896
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
Which girl are you?

897
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
My brother-in-law.

898
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Han Hua's little girl.

899
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
How about this?

900
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
Don't overestimate your position.

901
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
I have some books about women's problems.

902
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
If you are interested, you can take it.

903
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
This is my name card.

904
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
I have my address on it.

905
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,480
I'll write it down.

906
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Thank you.

907
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
You are off class.

908
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
I'm off class.

909
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
What did the government tell you?

910
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,480
The man and the woman's rights.

911
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Free marriage.

912
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
Really?

913
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
You men are so kind.

914
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
We have a 180-dollar marriage.

915
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
We are the same age.

916
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Of course.

917
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Please take this for me.

918
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Is it like this?

919
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
It's good to be able to get married.

920
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
She is not a bad girl.

921
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
You are a good man.

922
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Good.

923
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
Not only healthy,

924
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,480
beautiful.

925
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
But also social.

926
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
And also rich.

927
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,480
Okay.

928
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
I'm done.

929
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
I'm sorry.

932
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
