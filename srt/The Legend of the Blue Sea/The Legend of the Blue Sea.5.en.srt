1
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,130
- That side? - We looked.

2
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,050
Are you not hurt anywhere?

3
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,750
I missed you.

4
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,690
Flowers in this world have
special meanings behind them.

5
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,490
Do you know the meaning of this flower?

6
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,330
What is it?

7
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,870
Something that you have but I don't.

8
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,270
It's 'memories'.

9
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,420
Then, are you saying that the two
of them went to the office together?

10
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,320
Yes, My Lord.

11
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,490
Okay. Go ahead and work.

12
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,530
It turned out for the better.

13
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,080
Now that the evil omen has
penetrated deep into the village,

14
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,000
all that needs to happen are disasters.

15
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,070
That's right.

16
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,940
Then... What should I start with first?

17
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,750
Let go!

18
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,750
You, bastard!

19
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,020
How dare you block him. Come on in.

20
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,200
At this late hour of the night,
what is a guest of the inn doing here?

21
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Are you inconvenienced in any
way while staying at the inn?

22
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,610
Look here, Inn owner! No matter how
I think about it, it's just too much.

23
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,470
The fact that because you
have a permission paper,

24
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,180
you have forcefully bound our
merchant's ship at the port,

25
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:37,350
and are raking in a huge amount of fare to stay at
the inn; that I can accept. But, it's been 20 days!

26
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,450
We also need to make a living!

27
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:47,660
Ah, my dear inn guest, you have yet to promise that

28
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,500
you'll give us exclusive rights for the cargo.

29
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,070
Therefore the days just get longer.

30
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,370
Damn it! What a terrible robber you are!

31
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,970
It's as if you are blocking the
street corner to rob people.

32
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,310
Did you think we were traveling 1000 li (~400km)

33
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,510
No, 10,000 li (~4000km),
in order to satisfy your greed?!

34
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:12,750
I will reveal your
atrocities to the whole world!

35
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,260
Go safely.

36
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,530
Hurry up everyone!

37
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,540
- Huh! Isn't that a person?!  - Wait!

38
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,110
A person has died!

39
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,950
Tell the officials!

40
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,650
A person has died!

41
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,150
Episode 5
Oh, no, what's going on?

42
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
His height is approximately
7 chuck 9 chon (~170cm),

43
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,830
and his hair length is about 2 chuck 5 chon (~61cm).

44
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,330
There is no trace of battery or strangulation.

45
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,430
What about the reaction for poison?

46
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,900
We put the silver hairpin in his mouth, but
the color (of the silver) did not change.

47
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,510
They said they knew no previous illness for him.

48
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,230
Seeing that it's a death
without an identifiable cause,

49
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,710
there is a rumor about
a mermaid casting a curse

50
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,920
and causing this kind of misfortune,
and people are trembling in fear.

51
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,160
Please conclude the investigation swiftly
and bury the body in a nice and warm spot.

52
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,030
I think it's best to quiet
down the panic-stricken rumors.

53
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,370
Whether this case is caused
by a curse cast by a mermaid,

54
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,340
or a scheme crafted by someone who is using
people's fear; there is no way of knowing it yet.

55
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,710
I will definitely find the truth about
this death through a thorough investigation.

56
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,680
Until then, we will not hold a funeral service.

57
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,330
I am tasking you, Judicial officer,
physician, and undertaker,

58
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,050
to do your best in the investigation.

59
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,500
Who are you?!

60
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,100
Hong Nan! What brings you here?

61
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,780
Elder, this lady is the head
shamaness from Mt. Geumman.

62
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,380
According to her, an evil mermaid
is hiding in this government office.

63
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,050
- Geeze! What on earth?!
- What kind of nonsense is that?

64
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,990
You can't believe it?

65
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,020
Then, can we search this place?

66
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,160
Are you crazy? My Lord, the town
head, is not even here. No, you can't.

67
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:46,510
Should we cut out the town head or our elder?

68
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,210
My Lord! Wait, My Lord!

69
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,450
Right now, people are gathered at the
office trying to find the mermaid.

70
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,520
They are searching
everywhere and it's such a mes—

71
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,860
He doesn't even know how to be thankful when I
inform him of something! Let's go together!

72
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,510
I had a dream.

73
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,650
Inside that dream, I am living in a strange world.

74
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,590
And, you are also there.

75
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,290
I painted you and me from what I saw in my dream.

76
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,400
If that is just a dream or a hallucination...

77
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Or if I'm seeing the future of another world...

78
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,170
I can't know exactly.

79
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,280
One thing is certain.

80
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,410
Oh, no, you can't.

81
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,450
The things that are happening now...

82
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,860
will also happen at that time,

83
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,830
just like that... So strange,

84
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,570
the fact that this fate is repeating again.

85
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,540
Legend of the Blue Sea.

86
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,210
I'm here to ask about the murder case in house #22-4.

87
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,980
May I go in for a minute?

88
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,030
Police

89
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,200
Who are you?

90
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,540
Is this how investigations are done? I thought
it was normally done in groups of two.

91
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,640
Let me see your government ID.

92
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,340
You don't even have a 2-way radio.

93
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,350
You... Are you really a police officer?

94
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,320
Where are you going?

95
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,890
Take your hat off. I don't think that person is a
policeman. He's suspicious. Please go after him.

96
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,020
Sir, you're not in the situation to report others.

97
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,300
You were not compliant with the
police security checkpoint just now

98
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,360
and sped away with your car.

99
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,530
Why did you do that?

100
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Oh, that...

101
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,390
I heard that there was a murder case in this area,

102
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,210
and so I was worried about
my girlfriend who was home alone.

103
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,970
My girlfriend is easily scared.

104
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,380
I'm not easily scared.

105
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,280
Yes, you are.

106
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,810
I am?

107
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,920
- Yes, easily. - Easily?

108
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,690
Yes.

109
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,800
Excuse me, we are going to check
your identification for a moment.

110
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,990
Can you show us your ID card.

111
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,530
Ah, yes.

112
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,290
- I request an ID check, please. - Here.

113
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,500
Name: Kim Hyun Sung, ID number: 870521

114
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,210
What is this?

115
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,340
He's the guy that escaped after knocking
past the security checkpoints, isn't he?

116
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,540
I don't think it's him.

117
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,680
I've seen his back somewhere before.

118
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,030
Sunbae! We got a report that someone
has seen Ma Dae Young near Oksoo-dong.

119
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,400
- Where in Oksoo-dong? - Let's go for now.

120
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,300
Ask for a backup from the Oksoo-dong patrol unit.

121
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,910
Since I turned nine years old,
I used to avoid making

122
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,380
bogus phone calls to
the police and fire station.

123
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,880
But because of Heo Joon Jae, I'm doing this
kind of illegal act again. Geesh, Heo Joon Jae!

124
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,090
Yes, he has no criminal record and his address
has been confirmed. There's nothing wrong.

125
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,860
Anyway, because you have gone
against commanded instructions,

126
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,870
you have to pay the fee based on Traffic law #5.

127
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,470
Of course, I'll pay the fee. Yes.

128
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,110
When you get the notice,
you must make the payment within 60 days.

129
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,140
Yes, sir. You really are working
hard in this cold weather.

130
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,050
Then, we'll be going inside.

131
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,320
Let's go in. You were really shocked, right?

132
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,990
No, I wasn't really shocked...

133
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,130
No, you were really shocked. Come on, let's get in.

134
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,630
Where did I see that guy?

135
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,000
Do you know that person?

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,470
No, it's not that, but strangely I don't like him.

137
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,940
You know when you see a person for the first time,
but for some reason you really don't like them.

138
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,280
I strangely don't like him.

139
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,720
What happened here?

140
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,620
Does it hurt?

141
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,930
Hey, you. Why do you open the
door to just anyone like that?

142
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,200
I opened it because someone came—

143
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,330
Because it's not a shark, but a human.

144
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,700
Why would a shark come here?

145
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,910
And a human is more dangerous than a shark.

146
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,080
A human is more dangerous? Why?

147
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,610
In a year, there are less than
five sharks that kill humans,

148
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,950
but the numbers of humans killing sharks
is tens of thousands. Who's more dangerous?

149
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,820
Human?

150
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,960
That's right. That's how dangerous humans are.

151
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,730
So, when someone you don't know
comes, you should never open the door—

152
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,130
But Heo Joon Jae, doesn't your hand hurt?

153
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,000
Didn't I tell you, that protecting others

154
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,670
should be after you protect yourself.

155
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,340
It's the same for worrying. Before you
worry about others, worry about yourself.

156
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,750
You take care of your own body first.

157
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,620
Seriously, what am I doing...

158
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,020
Ah, I'm really weird these days.

159
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,570
But, Heo Joon Jae, I'm curious about something.

160
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,140
What again?

161
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,040
Where did the small people inside there go?

162
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,310
What?

163
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,350
Are they in here? Can't you tell them to come out?

164
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,350
- To come out? From there?- Yes.

165
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,460
Earlier, "Your real father is..."

166
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,930
It finished like this, and then said,
"until next time," then we will meet.

167
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,570
I'm so curious who the real father is.

168
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,470
- Are you that curious? - Yes.

169
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,840
Say, should I try asking then?

170
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,080
Oh, really? Are they people you know?

171
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,280
Of course I know them, they pay me rent to live
in my house. They live inside there, don't they?

172
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,450
Really?

173
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,620
I'll call them and ask.

174
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,390
Hello?

175
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,030
Yeah, are you okay?

176
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,870
Oh yeah, it's me, I'm the house owner.

177
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,740
What house owner?

178
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,000
How can you just go inside like that?

179
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,070
Go inside where?

180
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,680
I mean, shouldn't you finish what
you were going to say before you go?

181
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,540
Finish what?

182
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,810
Why do you stop in the middle of
saying something? That's shameful.

183
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,850
What's shameful? Are you crazy?

184
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,790
Say it.

185
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,590
Who is your real father?

186
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,930
Father? You really just hit my weak spot.
I'm an orphan, remember?

187
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,700
Yes, I understand. Yes.

188
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,200
Wow!

189
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,100
What did they say?

190
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,870
You say first.

191
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,300
Say what?

192
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,970
How we met in Spain, what we did,

193
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,880
and why I can't remember those things.

194
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,310
Tell me the truth about it all.

195
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,620
Can't you be the only one saying?

196
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,160
Of course not. Why? The world is 'give and take'.

197
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,690
Give. And. Take.

198
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,890
How can there be a 'take' when there's no 'give'?

199
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,130
Even if there's no give, can't there be just a take?

200
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,830
No. The world doesn't work like that.

201
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,940
Then, I'll just wait "until next time".

202
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,880
I'm good at waiting.

203
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,420
Hey!

204
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,730
You may be good at waiting, but I'm not.

205
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,370
I can't wait. Listen carefully.

206
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,770
For you, 'next time,' is tomorrow.

207
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,540
If you don't tell me anything
tomorrow, you have to leave.

208
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,710
It's tomorrow, okay?

209
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,300
What happened?

210
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,940
Haewon-dong incident. It's your doing, isn't it?

211
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,710
It doesn't matter if you believe me or
not, but I didn't do it.

212
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,910
Don't make things more complicated
and just do what I tell you to do.

213
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,650
It's not like you don't know
what card I have in my hand.

214
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,680
What about Joon Jae? Did you find him?

215
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,150
Send me the address for where he lives.

216
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,760
Mother, what are you doing?

217
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,760
Why aren't you sleeping?

218
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,160
I felt hungry after doing some work.

219
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,830
Is there anything to eat?

220
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,230
Of course, I'll prepare it for you.

221
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,440
Thank you.

222
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,850
Oh, I want to eat the sandwich that you make.

223
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,550
Really? I'll look to see
if the ingredients are there.

224
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,760
Joong-gu Sogong-ro, Road 4, Number 29.

225
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,800
Are the ingredients there?

226
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,910
Yes, I'll make it for you quickly, my son.
Just wait a little.

227
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,580
Oh, Mother, your phone was ringing.

228
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,350
Oh, my! Hey!

229
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,850
Oh this.. I guess you can't check anymore.

230
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,790
Oh, no.

231
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,190
You should have been careful.

232
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,060
I'm sorry.

233
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,660
Mother, why don't you get a new phone?

234
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,470
Who uses a flip phone these days?

235
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,370
I'll get you the latest phone, okay?

236
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,460
Hey, what are you doing?

237
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,830
You saw me?

238
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,270
Don't worry about me. I just wanted to see you.

239
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,870
Hey, put your head in. Go back in.

240
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,940
Go back inside!

241
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,550
Ah seriously so immature.

242
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,880
But why aren't your friends home yet?

243
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,090
They're not coming home tonight.

244
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,090
So you mean it's just the two of us?

245
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,200
Hey, you are scarier when you smile like that.

246
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,330
Aren't you going back in? What are you? A ghost?

247
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,670
I'm sorry, but can you just
not be concerned about me?

248
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm doing this just because it's fun. Want to see?

249
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,690
You can just close your eyes.
If you close them, then you won't see me.

250
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,560
This isn't some summer horror movie special!

251
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,420
When something keeps falling from above,
how can I keep my eyes closed?

252
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,460
Ah. So you don't like me doing this?

253
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,900
If you don't like it,
then should I come down? Come next to you?

254
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,370
Ah, okay. Then I guess I will have to come down.

255
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,010
Yes, come down. Come down so you can just leave.

256
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,140
You can leave today or tomorrow.
Whichever is fine.

257
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,850
Come down. Why are you going back up?

258
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,220
Close the door all the way.

259
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,390
Ah, she really scared me.

260
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,530
It'd be nice if tomorrow wouldn't come.

261
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,890
Why are you here?

262
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,530
I see you are still here. Is Joon Jae inside?

263
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,700
Heo Joon Jae told me not to
open the door for strangers.

264
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,170
I'm not a stranger though.

265
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,570
What are you doing?

266
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,540
You are a stranger to me.

267
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,410
Is this your house?

268
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,380
I came here to meet Heo Joon Jae!

269
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,650
Ah. I see.

270
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,630
Come in. Why are you down there like that?

271
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,300
That little...

272
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,210
Where is Joon Jae?

273
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,770
He said he was going for a jog.

274
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,210
What about Oppa Nam Doo and Tae Oh?

275
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,650
They haven't come back.

276
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,820
Unfortunately, it was only for yesterday.
Wish it could last forever.

277
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,320
Then, it was just the two of you yesterday?

278
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,460
Yep...

279
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,230
Cheong, listen to what I'm about to tell you.

280
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:54,310
To be honest, Joon Jae
and I are going to get married.

281
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,110
- What is marriage? - Marriage is

282
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,380
when a man and a woman live together,
love each other, and live for each other.

283
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,050
Ah, you mean like what Joon
Jae and I are doing right now?

284
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:10,420
No, what you and Joon Jae
are doing now isn't marriage.

285
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,520
To say it accurately, it's being a parasite.

286
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,590
What's being a parasite?

287
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,560
Being a parasite is sponging off a person.

288
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,170
Marriage is living with each other because
you want each other. That's the difference.

289
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,270
Did Joon Jae say, "Let's live together"?

290
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,310
He didn't. Being here like this when
the other person doesn't want it,

291
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:34,410
that's exactly what sponging off a person is,
like a parasite sucking the blood from a person.

292
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,120
I didn't suck the blood from a person.
I didn't suck his blood.

293
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,720
No. I'm not saying that you
actually sucked his blood...

294
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,360
You don't seem to understand if I say it politely.

295
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,260
Shall I be a bit more direct?

296
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,470
Just get out.

297
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,070
Don't just stay stuck here
like the king of all parasites.

298
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,180
Get out!

299
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,450
Ah! What is wrong with you?!

300
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,650
Ah, you're hurting me!

301
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,970
Are you some type of crazy puppy?

302
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,440
Why are you biting people?

303
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,380
Don't be too hard on her.

304
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:42,050
I screamed earlier because I was surprised
but it really didn't hurt that bad.

305
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,450
What are you looking at?

306
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,960
Cha Si Ah told me to get out.

307
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,690
- No, I just...  - Then are you not going to leave?

308
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,600
You said that you'd leave by
today if you didn't tell me.

309
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,300
What? What didn't she tell you?

310
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,340
Just something. Get up. Can you drive?

311
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,410
- I have to take a taxi.
- Let's go. I'll call you a taxi.

312
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,110
You better get ready to get out.

313
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,600
I'll come back for my car when my finger heals.

314
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,040
Oh, yeah. Did I tell you what
I have been up to these days?

315
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,480
In the sea in front of Yangyang, there was a
several hundred-year-old wreck discovered.

316
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,980
The relics found there are really unusual.
Do you want to see them?

317
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,780
Get in.

318
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,760
Winter Lovers

319
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,770
Did you know?

320
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,810
If you confess that you love
someone on the first day of snow,

321
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:18,410
then that love will come true.

322
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,910
Really?

323
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:25,080
I didn't know that. That's how it is, I see.

324
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,490
Winter Lovers

325
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,720
Geez!

326
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,860
You're doing so well, watching racy stuff.

327
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,610
Come here.

328
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,090
Come and eat.

329
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,360
It's hot. Blow on it first.

330
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,470
Stop blowing on it and eat.

331
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,790
Are you done eating?

332
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,990
Hand.

333
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,660
This is a cellphone.

334
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,030
You know what a cellphone is, right?

335
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,340
Watch here. Here.

336
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,640
If you press on this 1 for a long time, my
voice will come out.Person I don't really know

337
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,480
Like this. Sim Cheong

338
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,550
Don't just press it whenever you want.

339
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,420
Press it when you change your mind—when
you want to tell me everything.

340
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,820
You can only press it then.

341
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,490
And this is a public transportation card.

342
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,200
That's it. You can be on your way now.

343
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,240
- Go. - Is right now our "until next time"?

344
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,980
Yeah, you promised me yesterday, right?
Do you know why promises exist?

345
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,880
What did I say promises exist for?

346
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,680
They exist to be kept.

347
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,250
That's right!

348
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,990
They exist to be kept.

349
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,690
You're well aware.

350
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,430
So, if you have nothing else to say to
me, take that and leave.

351
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,900
Then you make a promise, too.

352
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,270
Why should I?

353
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,100
It's because of "give... and take."

354
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,910
- What do you want me to promise?
- Let our "until next time"

355
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,750
be on the day it first snows.

356
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,280
Hey. Why would we need an "until next time"?

357
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,490
It's because I have something I want
to tell you on the day it first snows.

358
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,860
What is it? Say it now.

359
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,890
Right now?

360
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,130
I can't say it right now.

361
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,400
Our "until next time"...

362
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,510
Over there.

363
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,210
What?

364
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:50,680
- Namsan? - Yeah, let's meet there.

365
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,790
I don't want to. Do you know how crowded it is over
there when it snows? Not to mention the traffic.

366
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,020
I don't go outside on those days.

367
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,560
But there's something
I have to tell you on that day.

368
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,830
If you promise me, then I'll leave.

369
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,000
Fine, I got it.

370
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,940
Leave.

371
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,020
What is this? Why aren't you leaving? Move!

372
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,290
I'm going to figure out exactly
what you are, where you are going,

373
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,530
whom you're meeting, and why you're here.

374
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,530
Go! I said move!

375
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,450
Don't be scared. I won't eat you.

376
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,850
How did you all get here?

377
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,760
Oh, from there? I've been there before too.

378
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,660
The water was nice there, lots of dolphins too.

379
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,370
You think this is unfair?
More unfair than what I'm going through?

380
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,540
I traveled such a distance with
my eyes on one guy.

381
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,110
I'm not asking for much.

382
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,740
I just want to live with him, us loving
each other and being for each other.

383
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,150
Not sponging off him.

384
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,820
I just want to do that.

385
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,850
What would you like? Do you want to come inside?

386
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,530
Bye.

387
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,660
Hey, dude. Did you really kick her out?
In this cold weather?

388
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,800
It's not even that cold.

389
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,470
Coldest day this winter... Snow 'Pouring'

390
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,070
- What do you want me to do?
You want me to take care of her forever?!

391
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,010
You're such an enigmatic punk. It was only
yesterday that you were through the roof,

392
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,880
both lights on, speeding like a crazy bastard—

393
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,180
Even when I told you not to go,
you said, "Cheong-ie's alone!" and went off.

394
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,250
But today you kick the poor girl
out in this freezing weather!?

395
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,650
I did that yesterday because it was dangerous!

396
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,750
Hey, isn't the outside world dangerous?
It's more dangerous out there!

397
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,490
Sudden Increase in Violent
Crimes for the Holidays

398
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,060
Whatever. What am I, her guardian?

399
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,890
I mean, okay, you're not her guardian.

400
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,900
But our Cheong-ie is the angel who gave you

401
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,700
a $6 million bracelet for free.

402
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,670
What are you glaring at!

403
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,080
Hey, you're the one who always said never
to go against people who have nothing.

404
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,850
Cheong-ie isn't just completely broke!
She has no idea what's going on around her!

405
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,030
What is this?

406
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,230
Why are you going to Gangnam?

407
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,040
- Where are you going?- Gangnam.

408
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,800
Hey, it's not the time for you
to go to Gangnam right now.

409
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,680
I've discovered a quite decent
target for our next project!

410
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,550
The highest degree that she attained was
from a girls' vocational high school.

411
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:21,390
But she goes around with a Harvard
sticker on the back of her car.

412
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,940
I'm saying, during a recess time like this,

413
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,760
we mothers have to join together
to stand against them!

414
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,070
Why do our kids have to go to the
same school as kids who only rent?

415
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,900
Isn't that why the neighborhood
always looks shabbier by the day?

416
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,670
She's sensitive towards the school
system and her neighborhood.

417
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,810
She named a dog "Oh Baek (500)" because the
expense of the dog is ₩5 million (5000 USD) a month

418
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,880
and becomes absolutely frugal when
faced with a 50 cent donation.

419
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,380
Why are you so curious, because of the bells?

420
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,950
This lady fabricated a decrease in
sales in her husband's account book

421
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,990
to feed her slush fund and they say she's
looking around to see where she should invest.

422
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,280
In other words, she's just blindly holding money.

423
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,290
She won't be able to report anything
even if she gets her pockets emptied.

424
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,700
Our food.

425
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,440
Welcome, Madam. Is this your first time here?

426
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,010
Lady, hold Oh Baek and give me my bag.

427
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,280
As you wish.

428
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,590
Hello, Madam!

429
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,860
Where is our baby hurting?

430
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,560
Ajumma!

431
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,030
What?

432
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,070
I'm going to the department store later

433
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,710
and I'm going to completely fill my
closet with new things, so throw these away.

434
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,710
It looks like there's a lot of new
stuff in here. Yes, I understand...

435
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,350
And Ajumma, what kind of get-up
is this when you're working?

436
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,520
What's... wrong with my clothes?

437
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,860
If I ask something, then answer it.
Don't question me!

438
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:10,800
Oh my, why are you glaring at me like that?
Lower your eyes!

439
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,170
"Hah"? We won't need much talking between us.

440
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,570
Ajumma, thanks for your hard work.

441
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,740
Get out.

442
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,760
- Please sit, Madam.- No, it won't take long.

443
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,370
I was going somewhere and
I just stopped by to say hi

444
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,300
and to thank you so much for the food last time.

445
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,070
Oh my, was it to your taste?

446
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:59,640
My darling didn't have an appetite for
a long time so he couldn't eat anything,

447
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,480
but he seemed to eat the food
from last time with no problem.

448
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,650
It must be just what he likes!

449
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,020
Really? That's such a relief!

450
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,060
I'll make you more whenever you want!

451
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,360
Get back safely and please drop by next time too.

452
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,130
Alright.

453
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:21,500
Goodbye.

454
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,050
Ajumma!

455
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,150
Yes. I will be packing my bag and heading out.

456
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,150
No, where?

457
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,350
You told me to go out.

458
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,690
If you are to throw away the
trash, you should go outside.

459
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,960
You can't throw away the trash
inside, so I told you to go out.

460
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,100
Go out and throw away the trash and come back in.

461
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,270
That's what I was saying.

462
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,070
What are you talking about?

463
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,900
You're saying why I was glaring and how I dress...

464
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,180
No, that is... if you always looked that
way, I was afraid your eyes would be tired.

465
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:08,850
That's why you should look down
comfortably. That's what I meant.

466
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,180
Your clothes are... What's this?

467
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,980
Where did you get it? Where did you buy it?

468
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,760
I was just asking how nicely they fit you.

469
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,690
You were hurt when you heard those?

470
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,160
I'm the one who's going to be upset.

471
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,060
You said, all this time,
I have worked so hard, so I thought—

472
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,500
Our Madam Mo has been working
so hard all this time.

473
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,270
That's why I'm so thankful.

474
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:34,340
In the future, please work hard too.

475
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,310
That's not it. I think there are
a lot of problems with my speech.

476
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,510
I'm going to have to be careful from now on, right?

477
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,420
No. I must have misunderstood what you said.

478
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:53,260
Then from now on, there is no
misunderstanding between Madam and me.

479
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,430
Ah! Should we go to Noryangjin later on?

480
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,160
To buy crabs?

481
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,400
You met that guy but got kicked out?

482
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,140
I wasn't kicked out. He just told me to leave.

483
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,210
- That is being kicked out. - But we
are going to meet "until next time."

484
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,740
Anyway, it seems like you will
have to live as a homeless.

485
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,250
But the timing is not good.
It's the severe winter season now.

486
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,650
Go and look for things like Styrofoam
boxes that used to contain a refrigerator.

487
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,450
Those things are precious because
a lot of people are after them.

488
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,260
You're envious of them, right?
They go home since the sun is setting.

489
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,960
Yeah.

490
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,030
I wish I had a house too.

491
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:38,200
But then, those. Their houses
are not theirs, but the bank's.

492
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,140
In professional terms, house poor.
They are beggars with houses.

493
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,880
Ahhh. They're beggars.

494
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,010
Of course. They are all bank beggars.

495
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:52,450
Look at their shoulders. They're all slouched.
It's because of paying the debts to the banks.

496
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,050
That's why Heo Joon Jae was
talking about money all the time.

497
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:00,430
In a way, we are richer than them.
At least we don't have debts.

498
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,760
There are only three things we
have to worry about.

499
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,500
Cold air, heat, hunger.

500
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,430
Score!

501
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,440
Why would they throw this away?

502
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,110
But then, how do you earn money?

503
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,980
Money?

504
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,350
Should I... make you touch one?

505
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,190
You can just give this out to people.

506
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,830
Look, the weather is cold so you see all
the people have their hands on their coats.

507
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:39,330
The goal is to make them take
those hands out of their coats.

508
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,600
Look at me.

509
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,070
The wrist snap is important.

510
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,450
Let's say they don't accept
it, you don't have to be hurt.

511
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,980
Just withdraw it.

512
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,420
The back and forth,
it's difficult if it exceeds two seconds.

513
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,890
And if it's hard and people don't accept it,
you can give several copies to one person.

514
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:12,130
If you just spread it out on the streets,
look at the 10 o'clock direction.

515
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,830
Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock.

516
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:19,000
The chief is watching.

517
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,470
See that? Here.

518
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,580
Do well. I will be going now.

519
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,640
You're not going to earn money?

520
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,280
If only for an insulated box to block the chill
and a crust of bread to fill the hunger,

521
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,650
I... don't earn such things as money.

522
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,160
I will earn money!

523
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,490
I will earn and give it all to
Heo Joon Jae who likes money!

524
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,010
Oh jeez.

525
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,090
I was wondering where she went.
What is she doing here?

526
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,860
That dummy!

527
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,560
Young lady. Are you the tide, ebbing and flowing?

528
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,370
Why are you just going back and forth?

529
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,870
I won't give you money at this rate.

530
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,540
I won't give you money!

531
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,470
Geesh!

532
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,310
That!

533
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,650
You're working hard.
You're the parking maintenance, right?

534
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,960
I want to make a report.

535
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:51,600
Hey! Ahjussi!

536
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,000
Here! Here!

537
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,570
Ahjussi!

538
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,810
- There's a hand! - Noona, give me some flyers.

539
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,710
Noona, give me a flyer.

540
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,040
The sauna flyer.

541
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,080
Oh! Me too.

542
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,750
Score!

543
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,020
One more. Please give me one more.

544
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,390
- Me too. - Give me one, too!

545
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,130
That's right.

546
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:22,690
I got two.

547
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:26,000
Hey, I told you it's 1000 won even for two flyers.

548
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,730
- If you want to earn 2000 won
go and get it again.- Really?

549
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,070
Hurry up!

550
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:32,470
I said that I'd only accept the ones for the sauna.

551
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,740
What is this flyer? Are you kidding? Out!

552
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,710
Hurry up and go. Look at you trying to be smart.

553
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,080
Hurry and go. You need to go
to the internet cafe, right?

554
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:07,240
You are working hard in this cold weather.

555
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,340
Eat this.

556
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,850
And also this.

557
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,720
Work hard.

558
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,600
- Is that the woman you're marrying?- No.

559
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,810
It must be unrequited love!

560
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,410
I said no.

561
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,310
What do you mean no?

562
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,650
Fighting!

563
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,150
It was one-sided love.

564
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,860
Excuse me.

565
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,200
It may be rude from the start,
but you are totally my style.

566
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,430
Perhaps, can you give me your number?

567
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,100
Do you have a cellphone?

568
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,800
Ahh, cellphone.

569
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,080
- Hey! Shim Cheong!- Heo Joon Jae!

570
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,950
I forgot to tell you something. If someone asks
for your number you can never give it, okay?

571
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,690
- Understand?- Why?

572
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,990
What do you mean why? Those are all bad guys.

573
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,660
You're good at biting, right?

574
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:41,400
Those kind of guys,
if they linger around you, just bite them.

575
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,700
I'm sorry.

576
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,040
Heo Joon Jae, where are you?

577
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,740
Me? I am very far from you.

578
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,880
Heo Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!

579
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,820
- Heo Joon Jae!- Oh, it's you.

580
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,120
You were here?

581
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,060
Yeah. But Heo Joon Jae, why did you come here?

582
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,330
Did you come to see me?

583
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,900
Have I gone mad? I was just passing by.

584
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,870
Weren't you the one following me?

585
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:19,140
I didn't. I really didn't.

586
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,570
Well, even if Seoul is big,
it's just within the palm of the hand.

587
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:26,750
If you turn around, you will
impossibly meet everyone, like that.

588
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,350
You can meet by chance.

589
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,450
Then we can also meet by chance again?

590
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,320
I'm not sure. We'll have to wait and see.

591
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,720
Anyway, I will be going since I'm busy.

592
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,730
Heo Joon Jae!

593
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:45,560
Hey! Don't call my name aloud like that.

594
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,430
Heo Joon Jae, I'm here earning money.

595
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,540
I will earn a lot and give it all to you.

596
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:08,990
Number 2708 will have
a lawyer's office coming in.

597
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:12,490
So we are still negotiating it. After we
set the conditions, I will tell you then.

598
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:15,290
Right. You will surely take care of it.

599
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:16,730
You'll be going home, right?

600
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,200
No. I have an appointment.

601
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Ah. But why are you dressed so coldly?
Dress warmly.

602
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,440
Father.

603
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,880
Joon Jae, you miss him, right?

604
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,880
The weather is getting cold. I am also
curious about him and want to see him.

605
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,350
It's about time he came back home.

606
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,290
Should I try and look for him?

607
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,920
Never mind. How would you?

608
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,030
Alright, the truth is

609
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:53,130
I've asked Department Head Nam to look into it.

610
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,670
Still, I'm grateful that you were worried.

611
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:00,170
No, that's a given, but Father,

612
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:05,340
I think it'd be best to not tell Mother
that you're looking for Joon Jae.

613
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,580
- Why?  - Just because.

614
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,800
Pure Firing Kiln Sauna

615
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,800
You're wearing a hat again?

616
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,850
She recognizes me.

617
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,210
Rain continues to fall in
the Seoul/ Gyeonggi region.

618
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,920
This rainfall will be affected
by the cold air in the atmosphere

619
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,080
which means snow will be falling quite soon.

620
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,400
It will be the first snow in the Seoul region.

621
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,550
You can safely expect extreme
traffic jams during rush hours.

622
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:24,990
♬ I think when you see my flushed face ♬

623
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:28,130
♬ Like a boy whose heart is racing ♬

624
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,730
♬ You are going to catch on. While I am flustered ♬

625
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,070
♬ I'm secretly stealing looks at your face. ♬

626
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:38,440
♬ Your hair fluttering in the wind ♬

627
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,610
♬ Your eyes shiny as a new knife ♬

628
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,140
♬ Your appearance fresh as the dew ♬

629
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,480
♬ are the things  ♬

630
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,480
Unni, what are you doing here again?
♬ I think of everytime I fall asleep ♬

631
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,550
You're not waiting here to take
money from kids again, right?

632
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:57,960
No! I'm earning money!

633
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,430
But is this the first snow?

634
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:04,460
Well, it's the first time this
winter, so it is the first snow.

635
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,630
What's so good about snow?
It just creates traffic.

636
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,840
I have to get to Namsan quick. What do I do?

637
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:16,880
You're going to meet Heo Joon Jae?

638
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,280
How did you know?

639
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,680
You just said so,
that you were going to meet Heo Joon Jae.

640
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,390
You heard that? People seem like
they couldn't hear my real voice!

641
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:30,220
I don't know what you're talking about,

642
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,560
but anyway, if you have money take a taxi.

643
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,830
If you don't, then take the bus.

644
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:41,300
Okay, thanks. See you again!

645
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,700
UP! Your math grades

646
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,480
♬ Other than you who are as
beautiful as the radiant sun ♬

647
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:58,380
♬ For me now there isn't anything more I want but ♬

648
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,920
Ah, how bothersome!
♬If you say you love me  ♬

649
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,960
I mean, why are all the annoying things
happening ever since that dummy appeared?

650
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,600
♬  I think you will leave me while smiling ♬

651
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:19,270
♬ Other than you who are as
beautiful as the radiant sun ♬

652
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:27,010
♬ For me now there isn't anything more I want but ♬

653
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,390
If you have something to say
there's the phone, there's texting.

654
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,220
Telling people to come and go, geez.

655
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,830
She better tell me something good.

656
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,700
Oh! Why is she so fast?!

657
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:52,340
♬  If you say you love me  ♬

658
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:59,110
♬ I think you will leave me while smiling.  ♬

659
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:07,690
♬ Like a fragile glass piece ♬

660
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:14,560
♬ Why is everything happy so insecure? ♬

661
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,600
Heo Joon Jae, wait for me!

662
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:29,510
♬ If I say I love you, ♬

663
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:35,380
♬  I'm afraid you will leave me with a smile. ♬

664
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:42,790
♬  You who are beautiful as the radiant sun ♬

665
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:49,190
♬  The dark sorrow and shade make my heart heavy. ♬

666
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,930
Why isn't she coming?

667
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,200
Special thanks to Actress Hong Jin Kyeong
for her special appearance

668
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,960
Help me.

669
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,000
Help me.

670
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,200
What are you doing!? Hurry up!

671
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,140
Brother, the mermaid just talked.
She asked for help.

672
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:19,480
Hey! What do you mean she said something!
I didn't hear anything. Let's go!

673
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,850
Let's go.

674
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,290
You were just doing your homework.
What are you doing out there?

675
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:33,930
Mom, she's asking for help.

676
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,690
Who?

677
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,600
Unni.

678
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,600
You're saying anything to get out of
studying, aren't you? Hurry inside.

679
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,300
Hurry inside, please!
