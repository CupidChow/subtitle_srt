00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,880
Episode 3

2
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,830
What is your name?

3
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,130
My name is Se Wa.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,170
I had a sister who passed away when I was young,

5
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,480
and that child's name was Se Hwa. It means—

6
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,150
It means

7
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,020
a "bright, shining child."

8
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,520
There was someone who gave me that name.

9
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,030
Shall I tell you that story?

10
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,090
Wow!

11
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,560
Summer, 20 years ago.

12
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,800
There was a child who came from Hanyang to visit
his mother's family's house to play at the beach.

13
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
Can you swim all the way there?

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,370
Of course I can.

15
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,440
Liar.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,840
Go then.

17
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,740
Okay.

18
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,140
My name is Dam Ryeong.

19
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,680
What's your name?

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,620
If you don't have a name, I'll make one for you.

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,420
Let's make your name Sae Wa.
It means "bright, shining child".

22
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,530
After that summer passed,

23
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,060
the child returned to his home in Hanyang,

24
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,770
but whenever he had the chance,
he tried his best to return to the beach.

25
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,240
Father, let me go! Please...

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,330
So this time after coming back
from your grandparent's house in Heupgok,

27
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,850
will you work hard on your studies?

28
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,580
Yes. I will do my best in studying.

29
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,990
That child allowed the mermaid to eat food
from the land that she had never tasted before

30
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,700
and allowed her to see beautiful
things for the first time.

31
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,330
♬  With neither a yesterday nor a today  ♬

32
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,440
Those two children spent time together
like that and grew up together.

33
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,580
♬ Without any sound ♬

34
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,450
In half a month, a future
bridal letter will come to my house.

35
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,020
I'm going to get married.

36
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,060
What's getting married?

37
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,400
I have to live with another girl.

38
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,330
I can only take care of and like her.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
Then, you can't come to the beach now anymore?

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,910
♬ The path which was
described as a starlit story ♬

41
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,670
I don't know.

42
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,410
You can't live on land?

43
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,550
It becomes possible when I turn into an adult.

44
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,920
I heard that if mermaids go onto
land, they produce legs.

45
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,690
But not now.

46
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,500
I don't want to leave you. I don't want
to take care of and like another girl.

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,700
I don't want to live with her
forever, if she's not you.

48
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,110
So what can we do? I can't go onto land,

49
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,570
and you can't live in water.

50
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,110
♬ Your shallow breath which is fading away ♬

51
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,080
♬ Are blurring like a stain ♬

52
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:13,960
♬ That sad story hidden in the sea ♬

53
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,390
On the first night of their marriage,

54
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,690
the child left his newly-wed room.

55
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,700
He rode for several days, heading for the ocean.

56
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,170
Sae Wa!

57
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,710
Sae Wa!

58
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,720
The child knew.

59
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,060
That the mermaid would definitely appear to
save him, who couldn't swim, from drowning.

60
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,470
But he didn't know an important detail.

61
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,640
Mermaids have a special ability.

62
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,340
It is..

63
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,120
That by kissing a human, they can erase
memories of themselves from the person.

64
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,800
Just like that,

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,300
the mermaid disappeared like sea
foam from the child's memories.

66
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,720
Why am I here?

67
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,060
My wife

68
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,930
died from a lung disease after marriage.

69
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,860
Right up to her death,

70
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,900
she resented me for running
away on our first night.

71
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,610
I just couldn't remember, no matter what,

72
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,550
why I ran away that night.

73
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,520
Am I

74
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,460
that boy?

75
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,870
♬ Always in the same dream ♬

76
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,070
♬ An unfamiliar face and ♬

77
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,510
♬ In a time which is suspended ♬

78
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,020
♬ You and I met by chance ♬

79
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,790
♬ I guess I was a little scared ♬

80
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,460
♬ I was afraid it would be a dream forever ♬

81
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,500
♬ Now, even when I open my eyes, ♬

82
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,900
♬ It's you. ♬

83
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,670
♬ This is love story  ♬

84
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,210
♬ I cannot hide ♬

85
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,110
♬ My two eyes which only see you ♬

86
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,980
♬ I cannot close them ♬

87
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,650
♬ This is amazing ♬

88
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,260
♬ Even if everything in the world ♬

89
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,990
♬ Were given to me ♬

90
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,930
♬ I cannot exchange it with you, my love. ♬

91
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,270
♬ Someday just once ♬

92
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,410
♬ Will come to me ♬

93
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,710
♬ That person, that love ♬

94
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,650
♬ I will find for sure ♬

95
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,350
Hey, ding-dong! I told you to follow me.
Where did you run off to?

96
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,960
♬ Even if I ask myself again ♬

97
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,700
♬ This is really love, you know ♬

98
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,370
♬ This is love story  ♬

99
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,140
♬ This must be happiness ♬

100
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,840
♬ I'm afraid it might be a dream ♬

101
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
♬ I can't open my eyes ♬

102
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,580
♬ This is my love story  ♬

103
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,490
♬ I love you, only you ♬

104
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,060
I love you.

105
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,900
Ah, why did I jump off from there?
Ugh! I must be crazy! Really!

106
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,770
Ah, headache...

107
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,670
What's this...

108
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,570
Would you like to have some wine?

109
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,760
Breaking news. An imprisoned murder
suspect in Seoul detention center,

110
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,530
who has been under the medical
care for seizure, is on the loose.

111
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:40,910
The officials released a picture of the murder
suspect, Ma Dae Young, who is in his 40s.

112
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,410
Whoa...

113
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,180
Valet parking

114
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,320
- How long will you be away? - About a week or so.

115
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,390
Have a great trip.

116
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,670
Taxi!

117
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,650
You're here? Alive?

118
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,780
Come here.

119
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,220
Get here!

120
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,820
Hey! Hey! I knew you'd be back safely!

121
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,890
That's why I didn't answer your phone.

122
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,460
Hey! You don't even know how
I think of you. You fool...

123
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,870
Sure! Is that why you're entering
this house as if it's yours?

124
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,610
If I couldn't return forever,
weren't you going to use it as yours?

125
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,740
My neck, neck, neck!

126
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,920
Ah, Jo Nam Doo. That untrustworthy human being!

127
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,620
Tae Ho!

128
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,730
Leave your bags there! Be comfortable! Relax.

129
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,130
I'm comfortable! Why? Because it's my house!

130
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,970
Hey! Did you crack my house passcode?

131
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,970
Hey, is there any house in
Korea that Tae Ho can't open up?

132
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,210
- Did you have something to eat?
- Is that right? Good for you!

133
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,540
I got it now, so get out right away!

134
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,210
Oh, no! What does he mean by getting out?
Where shall we go?

135
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,980
His and my houses are all broken into!

136
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,090
This is the only house not yet known because
you've moved and quickly cleared the address.

137
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,690
Hey, that Madame Jang Jin Ok of
Myeong Dong Capital is really

138
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:46,530
someone who firmly believes in "I
can do it!" She can do everything!

139
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,610
Hey, Joon Jae. Between us,
isn't there something important... hmm?

140
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,570
That we should talk about?

141
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,180
- What? - Come here.

142
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,240
- Why?  - Come, come! - Ah, what?!

143
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,610
Just for moment!

144
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,150
What's going on?

145
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,690
- Come over here. - What's wrong, Hyung?

146
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,290
Let me see the object.

147
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,460
- What? - Don't you pretend in front of me.

148
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:24,300
In fact, I was anxious that you might not come
back because of that. I was really worried.

149
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,940
That... What?

150
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,240
What do you mean, what?
Your and my 6 billion won! (6M USD)

151
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,880
- What is he talking about?
I'm tired.- Hey, the bracelet!

152
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,460
Jadeite bracelet, the one with the texture,

153
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,490
hardness, transparency,
and color that all seemed so real.

154
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,320
How...did you know that, Hyung?

155
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,690
- How do you think I knew? It's
probably because you said so.  - I did?

156
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,830
- Yeah, you.  - You said you swindled it
off of some girl that you met in Spain.

157
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,500
A girl? What girl?

158
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,530
Yeah, right. Others would believe you.

159
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,870
They would all probably be deceived.
But am I one to be hoodwinked?

160
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,480
Let's not be like this, Joon Jae.

161
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,650
What are you talking about?
What girl did I meet in Spain?

162
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,080
You said you met some dumb,
a bit lacking, and weird girl!

163
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,210
Take a look! The text you sent me! The
picture of the bracelet! You sent it to me!

164
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,180
Ah, I'm going crazy!

165
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,150
Ah! Hey, I'm going even crazier!

166
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,650
Hey, did you come back from Hollywood instead of
Spain? Your acting skills advanced so quickly!

167
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,750
- No, that's really not it. - What is not it?

168
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,360
I've never sent such texts.
And I've never even met a weird girl.

169
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,630
So you don't have a bracelet either?

170
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,430
I do... have that!

171
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,300
See?! You do have the bracelet!

172
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,040
Hey, it's not like you couldn't recognize
that it's an extraordinary item!

173
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,440
Where did you get it? You can't remember it either?

174
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,420
Ah! I don't know.

175
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,490
Hey, Joon Jae. I am like this.

176
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,430
I not only don't know what you are talking
about, but I don't even want to know.

177
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,160
Let's just see the object first.
We need to get it appraised anyway.

178
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,770
- We'll see.- See? See what?
Why do you want to see?

179
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,070
The situation doesn't really line up. I just feel
uneasy the way it is. Let me look into it first.

180
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,180
Okay, okay! I will gladly
take that uneasiness from you.

181
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,180
You just hand over that bracelet to me, and you
take that burden off of you! Huh?! Joon Jae!

182
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,750
Will you be going to Seoul soon?

183
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,160
Right. That's my home.

184
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,370
You should go, too.

185
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,020
It's not like I'm seducing you to go to Seoul.

186
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,590
So don't misunderstand me and listen.

187
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,340
In Seoul, there are so many things that you'd like.

188
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,160
For example, really yummy
specialty restaurants.

189
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,060
You love eating so much!
You are hungry at random times.

190
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,610
Also, there is a place called Han River.
In the fall, they have fireworks there.

191
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,480
I watch it from a good spot in Building 63.

192
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,120
Wow, that's incredibly beautiful.

193
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,690
I'll let you watch it with me.

194
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Together?

195
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,330
Yes, together with me.

196
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:33,290
You promised! A promise is meant to be kept.

197
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,520
What is a promise for?

198
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,090
It's to be kept.

199
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,290
That's right.

200
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,620
I love you.

201
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,760
Who was that?

202
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,870
What is this?

203
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,530
I'm going crazy.

204
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,480
3 months later

205
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,070
The concept of a real estate developer
is something that's novel in Korea.

206
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,000
Could you please give us a brief explanation?

207
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,770
Simply put, a real estate developer

208
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,610
uses creativity and imagination to

209
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,680
create something from nothing.

210
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,580
Typically a surveyor would look
at apartment complexes or...

211
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,020
- Ah, you worked hard.  - You worked hard.

212
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,630
I think the weather was on my side today.

213
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,730
Next time, when it's better I'll...

214
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,170
I'm sorry, I was looking from over there.

215
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,140
You look like a magazine spread, don't you agree?

216
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,710
What are you talking about?

217
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,380
They talk about being
daughter crazy these days.

218
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,420
Maybe I'm more traditional,
but I feel more secure with a son.

219
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,520
Daughters are lovely,
but a son is more like a replica.

220
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,460
He resembles me the more he grows.

221
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,400
Genes are such an amazing—

222
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,030
I received a call from Mother-in-law earlier.

223
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,430
She said it was very urgent.

224
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,540
- I'm sorry. I'll excuse
myself for a moment.  - Yes.

225
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,340
Excuse me.

226
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,940
- Why? - Watch what you say, please!

227
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,110
There are rumors that the son who is taking care
of CEO Heo's work is not his biological son.

228
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,420
- Really?  - That lady, Kang Seo
Hee, over there is his second wife.

229
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,990
She kicked his first wife out and
brought a son with her and took over.

230
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,490
CEO Heo's biological son ran away from home a few
years ago, and they have had no news of him.

231
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,760
- You didn't know at all?- No, not at all.

232
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,830
I told you to stop reading
newspapers and read some tabloids!

233
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,270
Things like that are a must in this field!

234
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,600
You don't think I messed up, do you?

235
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,940
I sucked up to him so much. Did you see how I
kept losing to him on purpose earlier, Honey?

236
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,580
I saw. Of course, I saw.

237
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,250
Let's see the big picture. Big picture, okay?

238
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,020
What's wrong with his biological son?

239
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,720
The scale of his rebellion is too big.

240
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,790
He's crazy!

241
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,160
Aish! Who drank all my beer?

242
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,700
There's no more?

243
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,640
What about my ice cream?

244
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,910
Are you guys not going to leave my house?
It's been 3 months already!

245
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,810
Hey, how can we leave?

246
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,950
Those from Myeongdong Capital are
on fire trying to look for us.

247
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,990
They think you're dead,
so they're not following you around!

248
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,520
I'm afraid they're going to
follow us to the end of the world.

249
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,430
So what? Huh? Are you going to live here? Live here?

250
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,660
Even if it's a bit bothersome, let's finish things
up. We also need to break ground on new work soon.

251
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,430
I'm uncomfortable, too!

252
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,570
- I'm not someone to sleep and eat with men
in one house!- Ayoo! This enemy of mine!

253
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,840
Please, collaborate.

254
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,910
Cheers.

255
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,120
Aigoo, you scared me! W-Who are you?!

256
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,260
- How do I get to Seoul?  - What?

257
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,990
Where is Seoul?

258
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,260
Is Seoul just straight then left turn there?

259
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,160
No, you need to go straight along
the west coast... then right.

260
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,030
Really?

261
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,000
- Thank you.  - But are you going to swim there?

262
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,240
But this is Jeju Island.
Would you like to get in for now?

263
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,580
It's okay.

264
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,080
Wait!

265
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,350
What the heck?

266
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,980
Is she saying she's going to
swim to Seoul right now?!

267
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,850
- Is she a haenyeo? (Korean traditional female
divers in Jeju)- No! She's a water monster!

268
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,720
- Hey! Should... shouldn't we file
a report?  - Look! Look, look here!

269
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,490
Everyone from Marine Girls!
We need to slowly wrap up!

270
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,300
Soon the Western Shore version of the
miracle of Moses (Parting of the Red Sea)

271
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,230
will start!

272
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:26,240
Miracle of Moses! Miracle of Moses!

273
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,570
What is that?

274
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,270
Oh my, what is that?

275
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,740
- Isn't it a person?
- Self-implode, you land-grubber!

276
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,510
Who's this woman with disheveled
hair?(she thinks she's insane.)

277
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,190
How is she from coming there?
Unless she appeared out of the water.

278
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,320
She's probably coming from that island.

279
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,510
- That's a desert island over there!
- Isn't she a ghost?

280
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,460
- Then she was on the desert island all
night and came from there?!

281
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,570
Is this Seoul?

282
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,470
No, it isn't.

283
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,210
I have to go farther?

284
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,610
That's so far! I swam so much I feel like vomiting!

285
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,450
Miss, are you going to Seoul?
We're going to Seoul as well.

286
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,060
Welcome to Seoul

287
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,250
There are more people
than a school of anchovies.

288
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,720
How do I find Heo Joon Jae?

289
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,760
Today Madam Jang Jin Ok will

290
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,680
have a golf practice at one o'clock and at 3:30
she will get a massage at a spa in Gangnam.

291
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,090
At Gangnam Empire.

292
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,100
Once we arrive, you go to the rooftop and
immediately start working on the elevator.

293
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,130
Hyung, keep checking to make
sure her plans haven't changed.

294
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,930
Okay.

295
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,570
As expected, you have to take
a break from work sometime.

296
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,610
Now that we're back at it, I feel like
I got a new job and am rather excited.

297
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,980
Excited, my butt!

298
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,210
Just think about packing up your
bags and leaving after this!

299
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,850
By any chance, do you know Heo Joon Jae?

300
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,220
By any chance, do you know Heo Joon Jae?

301
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,860
Excuse me, do you know Heo Joon Jae? Heo Joon Jae?

302
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:08,330
Who would know, out of all people, we would run
into someone we scammed at the golf course?

303
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,440
But I learned for the first time
that I'm faster than Usain Bolt!

304
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,240
You think Seoul is big, right?
It's the size of your palm.

305
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,580
As one lives, everyone crosses
paths briefly by chance sometime.

306
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,780
It's just that people don't know that fact.

307
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,790
- Aish.  - What the heck?

308
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,590
Excuse me!

309
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,390
A bottle of soju for 1000 won.

310
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,630
Please come check it out.

311
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,170
A bottle of soju for $1

312
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,800
Please come by.

313
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,070
- That car didn't come yet? - Nope.

314
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,470
Not until three.

315
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,310
What would you like?

316
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,440
That'll be 1,000 won.

317
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,420
But why are you giving me this?
You have to give me money. Money!

318
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,260
If you don't have money, go away. Quickly go away!

319
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,600
Smile, smile. Look ahead.
You have to look ahead and walk across.

320
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,100
We have to look as if we are close. Okay?

321
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,280
I need to buy a reference book,
but I don't have enough money.

322
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,010
- Academy fee for me. - Quickly.

323
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,890
- Thanks.- Thanks.

324
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,460
Thanks. See ya.

325
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,610
It's okay, it's okay. Smile, smile.

326
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,970
Look ahead. Walk while looking ahead.

327
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,380
Unni, why are you doing this?

328
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,850
Do you have money? I'm really hungry.

329
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,950
But I don't have money.

330
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,190
Even so, you mug a little kid's money?

331
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,660
What's mugging?

332
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,230
This is mugging.

333
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,740
I'll treat you using Mom's credit card,
since you said you were hungry, Unni.

334
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,210
What's a "mom-ca"?

335
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,310
Unni, how come you don't know anything?

336
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,910
Mom's credit card. Mom-ca.

337
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,280
Is "mom's credit card" better than money?

338
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,820
It's a similar concept. Anyway, don't do that again.

339
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,620
Okay. I won't.

340
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,960
Money is something that's
earned with great difficulty.

341
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,460
My mom has such a hard time earning money.

342
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,870
Without even having time to see me,

343
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:31,240
from morning to dusk, she only earns money.

344
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,040
But why does your mom work so hard to earn money?

345
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,380
Unni, seriously you're helpless.
Why do you think we earn money?

346
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,250
She earns money so that Mom and I can be happy.

347
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:49,520
But if all we do is earn money from morning
to dusk, then when do we live happily?

348
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,730
Later. Later.

349
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,340
Oh, I need to go to math academy now.

350
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,280
Be sure to find that person, Heo Joon
Jae, that you're looking for, Unni.

351
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,000
Keep this well, don't give it to
others, and use it well.

352
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,500
From now on, at least work a
part-time job to earn money.

353
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,940
Since living for awhile,
I came to know that without money,

354
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,780
there is nothing you can do in this world.

355
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,880
I understand.

356
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,780
Then I'll be going. Goodbye.

357
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,100
Aigoo.

358
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,570
Ajusshi, watch yourself.

359
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,740
Hey, kiddo. It's you who needs to be careful.

360
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,680
Hey, such a little thing.
Hey! How can I be an ajusshi?

361
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
- You! You! Come over here!

362
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,650
- Hey, hey, hey you're an ajusshi to her.
How could you be an oppa? Let's go. It's almost time.

363
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,220
Come here, Tae Oh. Hurry on over, Tae Oh.

364
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,690
Look, friend. Do you have money?

365
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,130
Your unni here needs to buy a supplementary
textbook, but I don't have enough money.

366
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,430
Look here. Don't mug her. It's a bad thing.

367
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,600
What's up with her?

368
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,670
You guys don't have a 'mom's credit card'?
It's similar to money.

369
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,280
Seriously!

370
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,350
How dare you, with clothes
that look like a beggar!

371
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Promise me. That you won't mug others.

372
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:20,210
I didn't... I didn't mug her. I-I-I'm friends
with her. ("To be friends" sounds like "eat.")

373
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,140
Your friends...?

374
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,340
You eat them?

375
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,720
Guys! You shouldn't eat your friends like that!

376
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,420
You shouldn't do that!

377
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,000
Do you also eat your friends?

378
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:53,210
Don't eat them, really. Eat something else!

379
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:58,280
- Are you okay? You got hurt.
Isn't she totally psycho! - Please. Don't.

380
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,590
Yeah, Mom. I'm at the cram school.

381
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,460
You're at the cram school, right?
I'm going to call and check later.

382
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,060
Don't hang around bad kids needlessly.
Look at your older brother.

383
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,400
That good-hearted kid got
framed and is suffering so much.

384
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,200
What's the big deal about a crazy
kid committing suicide? Hang up.

385
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,450
The Best Deal Ever! What the...

386
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,480
So useless.

387
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,160
It's stopping.

388
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,340
Geez. What's going on?

389
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,980
Who are you? You!
You're that jerk who conned me before!

390
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,450
I definitely heard you were dead.

391
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:18,060
Sorry. Looks like I'm quite invincible.

392
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,930
How dare you come here on your own-- Omo.

393
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,100
What's wrong with this?

394
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,000
It's so dark. Shall I give you some light?

395
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,640
The elevator doors opened. You know. Behind you.

396
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,220
But outside there is a bottomless drop.

397
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,520
No, what the heck is going on?

398
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,660
Oh, be careful with where you step. You might
step on it. There's someone's hand there.

399
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,500
Isn't that your son?

400
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,670
Mom! Mom! Help me!

401
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,440
- Min Jae,  - Mom!

402
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,910
Min Jae, hold my hand.

403
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,940
- Help me, Mom.- Min Jae! Min Jae!

404
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,120
No, you can't. You have to hold my hand and come up.

405
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,990
- No, no. Min Jae no!  - Mom!!!!!!!

406
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,260
Remember your pain now.

407
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,370
The child that your son made die.

408
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,000
The child who fell to his death on his
own from the top floor, the 17th floor.

409
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,110
That child's mother

410
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,080
was as miserable as you are now, and

411
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:51,220
forever she will be in agony.

412
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,740
Now, from now on those who have wronged you,

413
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,840
you will forget them all.

414
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,840
To those who are suffering because of you,

415
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,110
only remember your remorseful heart.

416
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,830
Madam, are you okay?
The elevator broke all of a sudden.

417
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,700
Contact Attorney Seo,
and ask him to cancel the lawsuit.

418
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,900
Pardon?

419
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,770
Also, you know the contact information
of the mom whose kid died, right?

420
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,240
Let me meet her.

421
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,340
What are you going to do when you meet her?

422
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,350
I'm going to apologize.

423
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:59,650
Madam, are you feeling unwell?

424
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,430
Is she crazy? What's with her?!
She seems to be absolutely psychotic.

425
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,830
Hey, look here, the heresy of neuroscience.

426
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:17,570
DIY-ace hypnotist of the medical field. Heo Joon
Jae's talent hasn't rusted even a little bit.

427
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,310
This is something really amazing, right?

428
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,440
Since we're in an occupation that
we can't exactly be proud of,

429
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,740
I'm so regretful that I can't let this talent
of yours be known to the world. Really.

430
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,380
- Ah, well.  - Wait.

431
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,050
How can you do it? Hypnosis?

432
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:40,690
Hey! Pray tell. He must be so curious that
he opened those iron-clad lips of his.

433
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,460
Are you curious?

434
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,530
This is how you begin, with the sense of sight.

435
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,140
The brain and eyes are connected.

436
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,250
She got the suggestion from
seeing the spam on the cell phone

437
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,470
and the moment she saw the number 17

438
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,340
a condition is presented
where hypnosis can take place.

439
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,310
Next, a pattern interrupt.

440
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:06,250
Shall I turn on the light?  That person
now enters the illusory world that I made.

441
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,290
But outside there is a bottomless drop.

442
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,660
Mom!

443
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,760
Everything starts with the eyes.

444
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,330
Looking starts the seduction.

445
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,540
Such a coward. Not everyone falls for that.

446
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,140
What's a fashion interrupt?

447
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,690
Can I really take this?

448
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,360
You usually can't, but I'll keep an eye
out, so hurry up and pick something.

449
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,500
This neighborhood is a rich one,
so they'll throw away new things.

450
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,870
Others are at the Seoul Station after hearing
that free lunches were being given out there,

451
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:04,110
but I can't leave Gangnam.
If you starve, you're starved.

452
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,250
I am a stylista who cannot give up on fashion.

453
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,090
But seeing you all dressed up like
that, you look a bit more bearable now.

454
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:19,460
Well, for us tall girls,
we look good in things we wear.

455
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,790
Where did you come from?

456
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,060
Across the water.  (She used the word water but the
homeless person understands it to be "overseas.")

457
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,130
Oh! Overseas! I know that place very well!

458
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:33,310
In my youth, there were no places like Milan and
Paris that I didn't go to to buy luxury goods.

459
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,440
Then I went bankrupt,
and even though I've ruined my family

460
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,710
and am living the street life right now,

461
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,310
I don't have any regrets.

462
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,450
But why did you come to Seoul?

463
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,320
I'm searching for Heo Joon Jae.

464
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,490
Boyfriend? Where does he live in Seoul?
Daechi-dong? Cheogdam(-dong)?

465
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,660
He just said he lives in Seoul.

466
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,460
What about his number?

467
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,970
Phone number?

468
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:03,870
Aigoo, he didn't give you a
contact number and ran off.

469
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,970
But you didn't realize that
and came all the way here?

470
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,240
Aigoo. That's when you need to
do an undercover investigation.

471
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,810
What is that?

472
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,550
He never talked about a
specific place with you before?

473
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:20,020
Unconsciously, he's bound to drop
hints about places he frequents.

474
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,990
You should go to places like that and camp there.

475
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,930
63 Building?

476
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,600
63 Building

477
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,930
4319 from Isu Station to Yangjae
Dogok Station to Samsung Station

478
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,010
Gangnam Station ----&gt; 63 Building

479
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,610
63 Building

480
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,750
- Welcome.- Thank you.

481
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,790
Welcome.

482
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,560
You don't have a bus card?

483
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,160
What about money?

484
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,930
I do.

485
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,940
That's not enough.

486
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,910
Just put in that amount and get on.

487
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,740
Thank you.

488
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,890
♬ Your eyes are trying to say something.♬

489
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:36,760
♬  It's meaningful, I can feel it.♬

490
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,230
♬  While you smiled brightly
in last night's dream ♬

491
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,470
♬  You were whistling like the wind. ♬

492
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:53,410
♬ On the path I walked alone,
in the dream I chased alone ♬

493
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:59,650
♬  You are at my side now ♬

494
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:07,360
♬ Why will I remember it forever?
How could that be? ♬

495
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:14,270
♬ Come a bit closer to me ♬

496
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:19,910
♬ So that I can feel you better ♬

497
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,610
♬  My heart is tilted toward you.  ♬

498
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:32,480
♬ Bit by bit. Bit by bit. Bit by bit. ♬

499
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,990
♬ A night alone. ♬

500
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,930
If I go all the way up, will I see Heo Joon Jae?

501
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,590
Be prepared tomorrow.

502
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,360
A restructuring is a restructuring. Also, the
fireworks! The people will come in droves!

503
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,700
- You need to be thoroughly prepared. - Okay.

504
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,800
If you guys are late again, even though
I said this to you, then didori-didori.

505
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:27,940
Ah, I'm relieved.

506
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,840
I thought I was going to die from hunger.

507
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,050
Are you done?

508
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,950
Is it someone's birthday?

509
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,750
There is someone.

510
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,760
- Today is my son's birthday, too.- I see.

511
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,860
Oh, what did you put in the seaweed soup?

512
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:25,130
Sea urchin. My son also liked
sea urchin seaweed soup.

513
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,230
Who are you giving it to?

514
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:32,370
Ah. That chic guy that won't fall for you?

515
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,120
Please put the soup into a thermos,

516
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,440
and as for the rest of the side dishes,
put them into a nested lunch box prettily.

517
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,310
Okay.

518
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,610
Miss.

519
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,680
You don't seduce men like that.

520
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,420
In the time that you bring the side dishes to
him, it's better to get one more shot of botox.

521
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:54,560
I'm saying that you need to love yourself more.

522
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,540
At a study group where I teach as a volunteer,

523
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,330
there's a kid who had a birthday.
So I'm trying to give it to him/her.

524
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,700
Who would seduce a man with
something to eat? How childish.

525
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,880
I cooked it with sea urchins. I'm not sure
if it'll fit with your taste preference.

526
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,180
How did you know about this place?
It hasn't been long since I moved here.

527
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,120
It came up coincidentally as I
was talking with Oppa Nam Doo.

528
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,620
Ah, really, Jo Nam Doo.
That untrustworthy human being.

529
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,840
Happy birthday, son.

530
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,680
Okay.

531
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,950
Mom, we're going there today, right?

532
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,350
Of course.

533
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,160
Your dad is busy again today,
so we're just going to go together, okay?

534
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,190
- Where are you going? - It's a secret.

535
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,000
Wow! Why the seaweed soup?

536
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,130
Hey, Cha Si Ah, you did this?

537
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,440
It's Joon Jae's birthday.

538
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,870
My goodness, look at her.
She doesn't look like it at first glance,

539
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:18,580
but she's excellent good-wife-material, right?

540
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,780
You made it so pretty, for real.

541
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:25,720
Hey, it's your birthday today, so you need
to do a party, a birthday party. Yeah!

542
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,420
There's a good wine bar that
I know of in Gyeongridan-gil.

543
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,160
Oh, Gyeongridan-gil is good! The water (pretty
girls) is good! Reserve it, reserve it.

544
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,160
I have an appointment.

545
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,260
- What appointment? - Ah, what is it?

546
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,900
You always do this on your birthday.
Being sentimental by yourself.

547
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,200
- Where are you going? Who are you meeting
with? He/she can just sit with us!  - Hyung.

548
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,670
- Yeah?  - Are you bored?  - Yeah.

549
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,870
- Very much so.
- Then go to the wine bar with Si Ah.

550
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,470
Go there and party. Or go with Tae Oh.

551
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,110
I ate well. Thanks.

552
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,750
Happy birthday! Spend it well!

553
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,590
Oh, he won't fall for it. Such a steel-headed guy.

554
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,360
Joon Jae isn't going to meet up with a girl, right?

555
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,270
- Did he get one (a girlfriend)? - No.

556
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,340
With his brain structure,
it's hard for him to have a girl.

557
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,770
He can't decide nor stay focused.

558
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,710
He'll let any woman cross that line,

559
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,650
but no woman will ever cross that line.

560
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,480
But did you really make this?

561
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,820
You think I would? The maid lady did it.

562
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,200
Joon Jae, we should go together.

563
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,040
Mom, I'm going to play
around until the door closes.

564
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,680
Be careful. I'll go with you. Joon Jae!

565
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,410
- It's a mermaid!  - Oh, look!

566
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,280
That's right!

567
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,150
There's still 30 minutes left until the
mermaid show. Did they start already?

568
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,990
- Mom.  - Yes?

569
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,390
The mermaid... slurped the fish up.

570
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:49,730
Gee. There's no way. The Mermaid
Princess is friends with the fish.

571
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,030
She never eats them.

572
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:57,300
Mermaid Princess! So pretty!

573
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:07,810
The show didn't start yet.
Did the diver go under already?

574
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,480
Yes, it seems so.

575
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,050
Look!

576
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,660
Who was it? Who went inside?

577
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,300
♬ The door to a new world is open. ♬

578
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,810
♬ It is within you. ♬

579
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:46,650
♬  When I enter my eyes are dazzled ♬

580
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:56,060
♬ A wide world welcomes me. ♬

581
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:03,000
♬ I approach you.  ♬

582
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,870
♬  I want to be embraced. ♬

583
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:12,880
♬ I want to stay in that world which is you ♬

584
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,310
♬ I owe you; I miss you  ♬

585
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:21,290
♬ I need you; I love you  ♬

586
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:28,130
♬ Eternally in your arms ♬

587
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:33,730
♬ There will be much that I don't know ♬

588
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:42,840
♬ Please show me your world and your heart ♬

589
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:53,050
♬ Will you come to me and take my hand ♬

590
00:52:53,050 --> 00:53:00,060
♬  I will love you.
Even if this world changes ♬

591
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,230
♬ I owe you I ♬

592
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,530
Someone went inside the water?!
♬ I miss you ♬

593
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,600
Exactly. How could such a thing happen?

594
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,020
On an important day that
we're doing a reconversion.

595
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,070
Wasn't there a huge security breach?

596
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,650
Isn't it that girl?

597
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,420
Are you the one who got inside
and did a mermaid show?

598
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,320
How did you get inside?

599
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,060
Excuse me, you need to come speak with us.

600
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,400
Guess who I met in Itaewon.

601
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,840
I met Tomás. He said he'd kill
you the next time he sees you.

602
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:49,010
I also secured a conclusive photo
that you met a girl in Spain.

603
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,480
Are you planning on still denying it?

604
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,660
Catch that woman!
Isn't she a spy from another company?

605
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:12,930
Oh, I'm so sorry.

606
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,470
- You have to catch her!
- What are you doing? Hurry!

607
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:06,080
♬ Always in the same dream ♬

608
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,350
♬ An unfamiliar face and ♬

609
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:13,760
♬ In a time which is suspended ♬

610
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,200
♬ You and I met by chance ♬

611
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,100
♬ I guess I was a little scared ♬

612
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,740
♬ I was afraid it would be a dream forever ♬

613
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:33,110
♬ Now, even when I open my eyes, it's you. ♬

614
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:36,950
♬ This is love story  ♬

615
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:40,890
♬ I cannot hide ♬

616
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:45,320
♬ My two eyes which only see you ♬

617
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,260
♬ I cannot close them ♬

618
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,860
♬  This is amazing!  ♬

619
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,570
♬ Even if everything in the world ♬

620
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,170
♬ Was given to me ♬

621
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:05,380
♬ I cannot exchange it with you, my love. ♬

622
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,780
I'm sorry, Heo Joon Jae.

623
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,020
You put this on.

624
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,190
I know you liked this.

625
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:26,230
You probably won't remember me. Still,

626
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,510
I will keep my promise. I'll go to you.

627
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:41,410
Even through the windy rainstorm,
though the sun may be burning down on me.

628
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:46,280
Though I'm lonely and without anyone by my side,
and even if it's somewhere I've never been before,

629
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,060
I will endure it all

630
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,360
and be sure to go to you.

631
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,810
I love you.

632
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:24,190
♬ This is love story  ♬

633
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,690
♬ That I can’t hide away ♬

634
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:32,730
♬ In your embrace ♬

635
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:35,530
♬ I want to sleep deeply ♬

636
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,240
♬ This must be love ♬

637
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,040
♬ This must be happiness ♬

638
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,750
♬ I'm afraid it might be a dream ♬

639
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:51,220
♬ I can't open my eyes.  ♬

640
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,120
♬ This is my love story.  ♬

641
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,290
♬ I love you, only you ♬

642
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,350
♬  Approach me a bit closer. ♬

643
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:26,420
Who are you? Do you know me?

644
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,560
You know me. You even know my name.

645
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,160
Who are you with?

646
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,530
- A girl.  - The girl you met in Spain...
you are meeting her again in Korea?

647
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:41,300
♬  Since the time that
she's come into my arms. ♬

648
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,640
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this to me?

649
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,070
How can you bring that girl home?

650
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,540
She's extremely dumb.
You're the perfect Sim Cheong.

651
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,510
I like it.
