1
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,650
Let go! You... You, Heo Joon Jae!
Are you not going to let me go?!

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,390
Mother.

3
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,320
Chi Hyeon.

4
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,100
Hey. Hey!

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,470
Chi Hyeon!

6
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,370
Heo Joon Jae!

7
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,680
I saw the person's face.

8
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,590
Heo Chi Hyeon.

9
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,820
Ah, really!

10
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:43,580
Heo Joon Jae, I was scared you were going
to protect me again, but I'm so happy.

11
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,580
The ending has changed.
This time, I protected you.

12
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,460
No.

13
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,130
It can't be. No. Please.

14
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,370
- You probably also know this by now. - Please!

15
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,870
That even though I'm not by your side,

16
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:15,310
- I'll keep loving you. So, - Cheong, Cheong.

17
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:23,750
be happy in all of the moments I'm not in.
Laugh a lot and receive a lot of love.

18
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:32,460
I wish you'll live comfortably, like how
normal people live, for a long, long time.

19
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:45,570
I don't wish to become your
scar or some type of nightmare.

20
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,710
Don't go.

21
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,620
Don't go anywhere.

22
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,020
I love you.

23
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,530
Please come here quickly! Quickly!

24
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,970
Please.

25
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,980
I love you.

26
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,690
The Legend of the Blue Sea

27
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,990
Episode 19

28
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,620
Ms. Kang, who was to inherit the
fortune of Budongsan's chairman Heo

29
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,390
has been captured by the police
as her husband's murderer.

30
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,920
The son of Ms. Kang and adopted son of Mr. Heo, Mr. "A"

31
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,830
also was arrested and charged as an accessory
to murder and for attempted murder.

32
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,370
Ms. Kang raised wolfsbane in her home,
extracted the (poison) from the roots,

33
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,410
and murdered her husband with the
deadly aconitine (toxin from the roots).

34
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,960
She also kidnapped Mr. Heo's biological son
and tried to murder him.

35
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,550
Police already on stakeout at the site

36
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,850
caught and arrested her at the scene.

37
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,250
In that process Mr. "A" evaded the
police and fired a gun at Mr. "B"

38
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,090
and Mr. "B's" girlfriend was hit and is
now known to be in critical condition.

39
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,370
After Mr. Heo passed away, Ms. Kang
was preparing the transfer of inheritance.

40
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,830
The notarized will was as expected...

41
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,530
Omo! What should we do?

42
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,600
see it as Ms. Kang having committed
the crime aiming for the fortune.

43
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,160
They have announced that they will
work towards tracking down an accomplice,

44
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,740
saying that there was an
accomplice in all these crimes.

45
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,840
They're injection ampules made with

46
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,560
the poison aconitine extracted
from the wolfsbane flower.

47
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
You might fail, so take two just in case.

48
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,330
Hey, are you doubting my skills?

49
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,470
One shot, one kill. Don't worry.

50
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,570
Okay then.

51
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,650
May I go to the restroom for a bit?

52
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,870
Please... don't worry. It's fine. Please... please...

53
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,750
You're an attempted murderer. Do you know that?

54
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,360
And you even stole a gun from a police officer

55
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
so it's special obstruction of
official judicial execution.

56
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,330
Why I'm living like an
animal driven into a corner.

57
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,570
Why I'm living like I'm receiving
a punishment, I'm not sure.

58
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:12,100
But I hope your life isn't like this.

59
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,380
I'm not sure who you are, but the
thought just occurred in this situation.

60
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,860
What...?

61
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:39,700
You guys did an Entrapment Investigation.
That wiretapping is illegal!

62
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,800
Can that be evidence?

63
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:48,140
That's not illegal. Heo Joon Jae was recording
his own voice but you, Kang Seo Hee— No,

64
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,380
Kang Ji Hyeon, interrupted (the conversation)
yourself. That can become evidence.

65
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,250
What a joke. You set it all up!

66
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,190
- When my lawyer comes— - What to do?
All those lawyers have left.

67
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,720
Find more or request a public defender.

68
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,260
What?

69
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,130
Hey.

70
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,200
What do I do? I think he took the poison.

71
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,170
What?

72
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:22,040
Why? Did my lawyer come? So are you guys surprised?

73
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,780
Ah, no, it's not that. Your son Heo Chi Hyeon...

74
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,490
Our Chi Hyeon? What about our Chi Hyeon?

75
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,460
Chi Hyeon!

76
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,230
Chi Hyeon! Chi Hyeon!!

77
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,370
Call a doctor!

78
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,100
We called 119 so they'll be here in a minute.

79
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,310
It's of no use.

80
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,810
Chi Hyeon!

81
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:05,120
I... endured as much as I could.

82
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,150
I dragged the time.

83
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,730
Why did you do that? Why did you do that, Chi Hyeon!?

84
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,090
Mother.

85
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,100
Okay, Chi Hyeon, okay!

86
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,470
Mother... That you're my mother...

87
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,580
has been a curse for me.

88
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,420
Chi Hyeon! Chi Hyeon!

89
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,230
Chi Hyeon! Chi Hyeon?!

90
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,060
Chi Hyeon!

91
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,140
Chi Hyeon!!

92
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,770
No, Chi Hyeon!

93
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,580
No!

94
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,380
Chi Hyeon!

95
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,290
No!

96
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,560
Operating Room

97
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,760
Joon Jae. I just got a call from Detective Hong.

98
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,530
Heo Chi Hyeon died.

99
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,170
He originally gave me two
doses of wolfsbane root.

100
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,470
But I said I didn't need both of them
and switched out the one that I took.

101
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,210
But it seems Heo Chi Hyeon had the remaining one

102
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,310
and took it.

103
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,420
It's so potent that if taken
orally it just takes more time,

104
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,780
but it's still fatal.

105
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,860
He's so irresponsible till the end.

106
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,250
Who's the guardian?

107
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,050
It's me.

108
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,590
Did the surgery go well, Doctor?

109
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,920
Well... we should look at it like it went well.

110
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,690
This isn't the level of "well" but a miracle.

111
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:06,370
The bullet went through the right
ventricle and the left ventricle.

112
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,140
I have never seen someone survive this.

113
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,240
I've never seen a case like this at school either.

114
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,740
Have you ever seen this?

115
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,680
No.

116
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,980
There was a lot of blood loss, and her
blood pressure dropped very low as well.

117
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,320
In these cases, they usually go into shock,
so I put her on the heart-lung machine.

118
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,490
But after I stitched up the puncture wound...

119
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,290
It's not normally like this.

120
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,260
But the heart muscle was restored very easily.

121
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,460
What about her vital signs?

122
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,130
That also isn't normally like this.

123
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,000
They are rapidly stabilizing.

124
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,100
Well of course, the location of
the bullet is quite critical,

125
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,210
so we need to keep an eye on her to
see when she regains consciousness.

126
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,740
Thank you.

127
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,840
From now it's even more important.

128
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,780
Because there was already a lot of blood loss,
if the circulation to the brain decreases,

129
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,350
I can't rule out the possibility
of loss of brain function.

130
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,420
Let's talk again after
she regains consciousness.

131
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,290
I understand.

132
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,230
But this patient normally doesn't
eat anything especially weird, right?

133
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,870
Rather than eating something
weird, she especially eats a lot.

134
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,240
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

135
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,650
This jerk.

136
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,390
How could you leave like that?

137
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,560
Which girl are you going to?

138
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,340
What the?

139
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,200
From sometime in the early morning, I've been
dreaming that I was deserted by my husband...

140
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,010
And why was there a traditional
bridal crown? So annoying!

141
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:34,050
Tell me. Can you... take a gun shot in my place?

142
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,950
I can only go as far as getting hit by a stone.

143
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,520
I knew it.

144
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,220
What about you?

145
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,830
I have to raise the kids.
If I get shot, who will raise the kids?

146
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,900
Why are you guys suddenly talking about guns?

147
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,970
You haven't heard about it yet?

148
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,040
- I thought they were close to each
other, but I guess not. - It seems so.

149
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,970
- About what? - Your friend!

150
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,710
Unni Yoo Ran's son, Heo Joon Jae.

151
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,310
- What about Joon Jae?
- The adoptive son of that household

152
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,450
- shot at the biological son Heo Joon Jae,  - What?

153
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,490
and the girlfriend took
that gunshot instead of him.

154
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,320
Isn't it like a movie? Right?
They're at the hospital right now.

155
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,530
So Yoo Ran Unni left early in the
morning to see the surgery results.

156
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,630
You should watch the news! The news!

157
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,770
You said the surgery went well,
but why isn't she regaining consciousness?

158
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,170
Because it's a big surgery,
it must be taking some time.

159
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,780
Did she talk about doing this?

160
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,450
What talk?

161
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,150
In just a few days, your face got so gaunt.

162
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,060
Eat this.

163
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,530
- Mom, you know about the Little
Mermaid story, right? - I do.

164
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,470
In the end, the mermaid gets a knife, right?

165
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,800
If she killed the prince with the
knife, she would live,

166
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,770
but if she failed to kill him,
she would become sea foam and disappear.

167
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,740
What would you do?

168
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,310
Why are you asking that?

169
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,250
I think it's right for the mermaid to disappear,

170
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,650
because it's a story that the mermaid started

171
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,590
with her greed to come up on the shore.

172
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,690
That's not how I think.

173
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,920
Why?

174
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,590
Once upon a time, a young man went out
to sea, but the ship got overturned.

175
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,060
He met a mermaid and he was saved.

176
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,330
He married the mermaid and had babies.

177
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,670
They lived happily.

178
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,170
The children who were born
through the human and the mermaid.

179
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,340
Some returned to the water,
and some remained on land.

180
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,880
They became like patron saints
to the people of that village.

181
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,280
While communicating with the mermaids
of the sea, when there was a storm

182
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,520
they told people ahead of
time not to go out to sea.

183
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,260
There's this mermaid story too.

184
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,260
It's not because of greed that the mermaid
went up onto the shores but because of love.

185
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,870
Although it would be nice if
all stories had happy endings,

186
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,140
there are stories that don't.

187
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,210
She talked about that?

188
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,450
Yeah. So since this is what happened,

189
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,080
my heart hurts a lot.

190
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,120
I need her to quickly wake up
so that I can say thank you.

191
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,820
How did she think of running in front of a gun?

192
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,530
You could just easily get shot.

193
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,560
No. You can't. You'll die like a dolphin.

194
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,740
That's what I'm saying.
The person who was so scared of a gun

195
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,770
had no fear.

196
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,740
But, Mother, is there really a legend like that?

197
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,510
Did he really marry the mermaid and have babies

198
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,150
and happily live for a long, long time?

199
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,150
Do you not remember?

200
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,990
When you were little and said you couldn't
sleep, I would always tell you that story.

201
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,030
You liked it so much.

202
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,760
I see.

203
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,000
It would be nice if that was true.

204
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:20,370
By the way, I'll stay here, so would you
take that to Department Head Nam's wife?

205
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,810
Okay.

206
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,550
Where are you going? Want to go together?

207
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,180
Let's go.

208
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,160
- Ahjummonim. - Oh, Joon Jae!

209
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,660
I heard the news. How could this have happened?

210
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,370
The surgery ended well.

211
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,500
- He's a close hyung. - Ah, yes.

212
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,110
Hello. I've heard a lot
about Ahjussi from Joon Jae.

213
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,210
He is very impressive.

214
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,420
I feel like I've seen him a lot somewhere.

215
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,050
When you go straight on
this road and pass the hill,

216
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,740
there will be a place which is the Bangcheon Inn.

217
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,370
Pardon?

218
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,950
Tell them to give you the horse
that Park Moo asked them to hold.

219
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,490
Ride that horse to the capital

220
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,620
and do the work that the
Town Head requested of you.

221
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,220
Why are you doing this?

222
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,560
To pay back. Both to pay back for
kindness and to pay back for enmity.

223
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,630
I don't have the time to
explain so hurry up and move.

224
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,340
Hurry.

225
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,670
Thank you.

226
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,950
- My mother asked me to give this to you.
- You didn't have to. I'm so thankful.

227
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,390
- Don't skip meals. - Okay. Thank you.

228
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,220
Oh!

229
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,160
Park Moo.

230
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,600
Honey! Did your eyes open?
Did you just talk? Doctor!

231
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,870
Doctor!

232
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,670
Ahjussi...

233
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,070
Park Moo.

234
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,610
Park... what? I'm not Park Moo, I'm Jo Nam Doo.

235
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,610
Dam Ryeong.

236
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,100
Joon Jae.

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,100
I dreamed a very long dream.

238
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,770
It's good that you woke up.

239
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,110
Back then and even now,

240
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,250
thank you for being my friend.

241
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,270
Why is she not waking up?

242
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,310
That's what I'm saying.
They definitely said the surgery went well.

243
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:48,610
Is there something definitely different
than us, neurologically or something?

244
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,150
What are you saying?

245
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,320
To be honest, I heard the
conversation between you guys.

246
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,360
Between you and Cheong...
about a mermaid and things like that.

247
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,800
Hah! It was a joke.
Do you believe that? Are you joking?

248
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,710
I know, right? Our house isn't even some cartoon
park or something. I don't know why I believe this,

249
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,880
but I believe it. Cheong isn't like us.

250
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,350
She's a mermaid.

251
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,060
Hey, don't be nervous! You think
I'll do something to your girlfriend?

252
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,660
Yeah, you could do more than that.

253
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,320
Hey, it's true that I may be a guy
whose eyes become blinded by money,

254
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,360
but I keep true to two principles.

255
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,600
What?

256
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,800
I, without fail, pay back my enemies.
I pay back my debts if possible.

257
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,780
Although Cheong didn't save me,

258
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,010
she protected my Joon Jae. My Joon Jae.

259
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,650
Hey, so would I do anything to Cheong?

260
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,850
What do you mean "my Joon Jae?" Are you crazy?

261
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,490
Hah! You're saying outrageous things!
So cringe-worthy.

262
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,460
Hey, and this was sincere but after
saying it I feel all cringy too.

263
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,730
Heo Joon Jae is my Joon Jae. Don't mess with him.

264
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,600
You woke up, Cheong?

265
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,140
As expected, invincible Cheong!

266
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,610
Are you okay?

267
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,750
If you hadn't awakened

268
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,750
I really would have followed you.

269
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,860
Why?

270
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,160
You said you'd meet a prettier
woman and live and eat well.

271
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,900
But there aren't any. There's none that is
prettier than you no matter how much I search.

272
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,470
You looked?

273
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,470
I thought about it and (realized) life is short.

274
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:59,180
I feel that my love will be longer than my life.

275
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,920
So that's why, in this life, my love won't end.

276
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,400
Thank you...

277
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,170
for returning.

278
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,440
Who's saying who's cringe-worthy?

279
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,840
Policeman Who Devote Their All
She's coming out! Murderer!

280
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,710
Murderer!

281
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,510
You're not a human!

282
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:44,750
- How dare you!  - Murderer! You murderer!

283
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,320
You feel like you won everything, right?
No! This isn't the end!

284
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,570
It won't end like this. It can't end. Okay?

285
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,970
My son can't be the only one to suffer like this.
"This afternoon, the wife, Ms. Kang, got arrested."

286
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,570
Don't end it like this! Don't end it!

287
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,080
Hey, you murderer!

288
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,620
Professor Jin Gyeong Won

289
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,740
Yes, this is Jin Gyeong Won

290
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,400
Ma Dae Young?

291
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,950
Joon Jae, Ma Dae Young is coming this way.

292
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,920
Yes, I'll go over there right now.

293
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,520
Yeah, Hyung. It's me. Contact Detective Hong.

294
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,130
Ma Dae Young is going to
Professor Jin Gyeong Won.

295
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,300
Do you not remember anything?

296
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,470
I only remember from the time I met that girl.

297
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,440
But... why do you suddenly want
to search for your memories?

298
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,540
Have you ever wandered without your memories?

299
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
The feeling of being trapped in the
woods with your two eyes covered

300
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,150
but hearing the sound
of animals from all around.

301
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,180
The fear of being eaten by
that animal is not what's hard,

302
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,790
but the fear of not knowing when and where
something will come jumping out at you...

303
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,020
That's what makes me crazier.

304
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:37,030
At times, couldn't the fear
be better than the reality?

305
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,970
No, but I still have to know.
I can't live like this anymore.

306
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,170
Because of a sin that I can't even remember

307
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,140
I can't live paying the punishment.

308
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,540
Mr. Cheon.

309
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,180
Mr. Cheon, I heard you can tell fortunes
better than most shamans out there.

310
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,620
It's not that I have any
special powers of divination,

311
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,190
it's only that I have a lot
of interest in others' fates.

312
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:42,890
Anyhow, read our fortune for the new year.

313
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,140
The beautiful flowers that pierced
the harsh snow and bloomed everywhere

314
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,770
are all yours.

315
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:59,850
They're all mine, the beautiful flowers?

316
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,220
Why? They're not gold and precious things?

317
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,120
The captivating scent of those flowers

318
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,560
will permeate your body's
crevices until you die.

319
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:18,530
Even if they die and are reborn, they will
not leave each other and will be together.

320
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,800
It's something good, right?

321
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,810
Sin cannot determine fate's good and evil.

322
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,420
Then, what about me?

323
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,460
A tree hit by lightning still has
spirit left so it grows again.

324
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,960
Are you receiving the
punishment so you can live?

325
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,470
Or are you living so you can
receive the punishment?

326
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,400
You will live a confusing life.

327
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,010
What are you saying?

328
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:06,610
So, you might as well get hit by
lightning and burn into black ashes.

329
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:11,650
It would have been better
to not have been born again

330
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,350
but this is also a fate you have no choice in.

331
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,360
It's a shame.

332
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,700
This rascal...
What an unlucky start to the new year!

333
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,270
Leave, you rascal!

334
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,140
Get whomever.

335
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,150
Do you know Park No Joon?

336
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,160
I've never heard of, met, or seen that person.

337
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,200
His ship was forcibly held at the port,
so he had to stay here for 20 days

338
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,170
and was found as a cold corpse
just because he objected to that.

339
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,110
You wretched thief!

340
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,710
Even if you block the path and commit
highway robbery, how could you do this?

341
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:16,180
Did you think you were making that long trip
back and forth to China to fatten your belly?

342
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,350
I'm going to expose your crimes to everyone!

343
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,750
A man has died! Quickly tell the officials.

344
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,060
There's a person who has died!

345
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,100
I am his son, Park Moo.
I will repay the enemy of my father,

346
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,370
and for the kindness of Kim Dam Ryeong together.

347
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:00,160
I will definitely be born again.

348
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:06,970
I will be reborn and whatever
I didn't own in this world,

349
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:13,240
I will definitely own it all.

350
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,540
Make sure to do so. No matter how many times
you reincarnate, I will also reincarnate,

351
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,650
and I will avenge the wrongdoing
and repay the kindness again.

352
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,160
This woman put poison in my father's drink?

353
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,730
I have prepared a poison worthy of you.

354
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,320
Do you know what wolfsbane flower is?

355
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,450
It is a beautiful flower which produces
a deadly poison which is given by a king.

356
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,950
You should receive it with grateful heart.

357
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,050
I saw it.

358
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:35,150
In my past life, me, Dam Ryeong, mermaid.

359
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,960
And you. You always knew everything.

360
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,700
Just like how I received
punishment in this life,

361
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,100
the fate I must fulfill.

362
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,140
You hovered around me and just watched?

363
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,880
Just whose side are you on?

364
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,080
It was like that then, and it's like this now, too.

365
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,090
I'm just someone who observes fate.

366
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:11,090
I am on no one's side.

367
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:20,230
That's not so. You knew it all. Right?

368
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,750
Professor!

369
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,900
Remember. I have won against you two again.

370
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,440
If there is a destiny,

371
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,210
it will be on my side this time as well.
In this life, also,

372
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,310
in the end, everything will repeat.

373
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,020
A hopeless love between a human and a wily being.

374
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,250
Misery would be waiting at the end of that.

375
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,730
It does not matter whose side fate is on.

376
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:27,470
At the end of that ill-fate, we were together,
so we were happy. It is the same now.

377
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,620
Joon Jae!

378
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,860
Put that down!

379
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,790
I have finally caught you.

380
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,600
Drop the blade.

381
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,880
Joon Jae, are you alright?

382
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,190
Why is he glaring at me? It's our first meeting.

383
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,190
Oh my, that scared me! What a surprise.

384
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,700
So unexpected from you.
Are you here to visit me? With flowers?

385
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,170
Well...

386
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,750
I heard you were unconscious,
so I was just going to leave the flowers.

387
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,850
Are you subtly worried about me?

388
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,980
Well, rather than that...

389
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,020
Honestly, it's my first time
seeing someone who got shot.

390
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,860
Did you really get shot? Oh my, what to do?
It must've really hurt.

391
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,190
So, where precisely did you get hit?

392
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,800
It sort of sounds like you're enjoying this.

393
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,400
Hey, are you insane?

394
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,900
I don't really like you, but it's not like I hate
you to the point that I would be glad you got shot.

395
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,910
Then, do you like me?

396
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,110
I told you. It's not that I totally like you.

397
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,280
I like you, though.

398
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,350
Oh, you're quite blunt.

399
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,480
But why?

400
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,220
I always wanted to be like you.

401
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,560
Ah, it shouldn't be easy becoming like me. But why?

402
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,760
You can grow old with the person you like.

403
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Are you saying I'm old?

404
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,400
I look young for my age. I'm not the
type who'll grow old with someone.

405
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,170
Not that, but I'm envious.

406
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:25,180
You can spend lots of time
with the person you like.

407
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,080
What can I do when I have lots of time? The person
I want to spend time with only looks at you.

408
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,090
Ah, I even dreamed of getting dumped by
my husband! Hey, I'm more envious of you.

409
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,960
Your fated person will appear.

410
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,490
Did you get possessed by a spirit
after getting shot? What's with you?

411
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,800
I also have waited a long time, and he appeared.

412
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,100
So yours will appear as well, Cha Si Ah.

413
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,180
You're telling me to stay
away from Joon Jae, right?

414
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,340
I was going to do that without
you telling me anyway.

415
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,380
You'll even get shot for Heo Joon Jae.
How could I beat that?

416
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,180
Get well soon.

417
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,990
Myeongseong University Hospital

418
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,270
It's snowing.

419
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,310
♬ Why am I looking at her? ♬

420
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,850
Tae Ho. ♬ (Could it be love?) ♬

421
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,850
Yes, Noona. Are you going home?

422
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,720
Yes. ♬ Why do I smile when I see her?♬

423
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,760
♬ (Could it be love?) ♬

424
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,590
You're not taking me home?

425
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,830
- Should I take you?  - No,

426
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,430
I thought you wanted to take me.

427
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,770
Never mind. Then...

428
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,670
♬Why am I like this? Why?♬

429
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,140
I said it's fine.

430
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,870
Do whatever you want.

431
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,310
♬Why does my heart keep trembling?♬

432
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,910
The snow is so pretty.

433
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,350
It is.

434
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,090
I'm being generous.

435
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,400
You have to have some proper pictures.
You always get sneak shots.

436
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,700
What the heck?

437
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,970
Aren't all of these pictures of Cheong?

438
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,080
Come here you!

439
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:44,750
So the one you liked was not me but Cheong?
Was that it?

440
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,620
Then why did you confess that you liked me?

441
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,850
The thing is... There was some situation...

442
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:55,130
What? Then what did I do all this time? Did I put
on a show by myself? Why didn't you tell me?

443
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:00,430
Was it fun seeing me like that? I didn't
even know you were playing with me,

444
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,470
I was concerned that you might
get hurt since you liked me.

445
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,540
I was even considering accepting your heart—

446
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,930
I told you not to follow me!

447
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,690
I'm sorry.

448
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,160
I'm sorry, Noona.

449
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:16,140
♬ It becomes clear now.
That everything will be for the two of us ♬

450
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:23,180
♬ Once more was not accidental. ♬

451
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,520
♬ Forever we had to meet. ♬

452
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,090
The area of the injury stopped
bleeding so I checked the wound, but

453
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,430
there was nothing to bandage.

454
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,710
That's nonsense.

455
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,200
Are you sure you didn't see wrong? How could a
bullet wound disappear that quickly?

456
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,270
But then, now the doctors who were in
the operating room are dumbfounded too.

457
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,920
At first, the bleeding was excessive.

458
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,710
Everyone was nervous, just in case
the aorta (main artery) was ruptured.

459
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,180
But, it's completely clean without even a wound.

460
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,650
Really? What is this? It's scary.

461
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,250
Perhaps, is it something like that? Alien?

462
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,250
That's going a bit far.

463
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,850
- Zombie? - Vampire.

464
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:05,160
Anyway, the Chief said he'll report the
case at the Heart Association and the AHA

465
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,630
and he's really excited about
contributing to the journal.

466
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,300
I think he already contacted a reporter as well.

467
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,830
Oh, are we being broadcast?

468
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,070
Just get to work.

469
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,700
Let's go.

470
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,640
Are you alright?

471
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,620
- Hello. Did you get the pass to get out? - Yes.

472
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,990
Make sure to take your medication.

473
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,940
Staff Only

474
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,050
Myeongsung College Hospital Records

475
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,760
Search

476
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,330
Delete patient records.

477
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,230
No records for this patient.

478
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:25,270
Cheong. Cheong.

479
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,080
Let's go home.

480
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,950
- Go home ?  - Yeah.

481
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,830
Hey, Upstair's Room.

482
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,040
- What is it?  - Well,
I've been thinking, when Mom moves in,

483
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:03,540
I think she needs to use this room. Then I don't
have a room, even though I'm the home owner.

484
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,920
So, I think you and I should
share the loft together.

485
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,920
But, when I thought about it,

486
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,860
I wondered if there was a need
to wait until Mom moved here.

487
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,690
Right? Should I go up?

488
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,790
No.

489
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,830
So I should. I'll go up.

490
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,780
How long ago was it when you barged down here
and stayed with me when I told you not to come?

491
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,020
She's changed.

492
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:01,270
♬  Although I can't tell you everything ♬

493
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:07,940
♬ About your loneliness ♬

494
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:14,850
♬ Without saying anything just bear it ♬

495
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:21,290
♬ If I could give you a hug ♬

496
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,220
♬ Without any reason ♬

497
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:32,730
Ah, Unni. What am I going
to do because of my sadness?

498
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,570
I'll see you often. It's not that far away either.

499
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,200
This is your son's place?
Your son lives in a nice home.

500
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Thanks for dropping me off here.
Be careful on your way back.

501
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:57,160
She doesn't even invite me in,
when that's the reason I came here.

502
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,830
You're home? Aren't these Ahjumeoni's shoes?

503
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,430
Take these and give them to her later.

504
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,430
What are you saying?

505
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:13,610
Ah, this is why I can't trust
you and leave business to you.

506
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,170
Let's go. To Cheonghae's heir's house.
(reference to Lee Min Ho's drama, Heirs)

507
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,820
Unni! You left this at our place.
These are shoes that you cherish.

508
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,320
Oh my, I was going to throw these away.

509
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,490
But I really need to use the bathroom.

510
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,020
And I'm thirsty.

511
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,090
Oh, yes. Please come in.

512
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,660
Oh, this place is so nice!

513
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,630
Wow, it looks amazing. So this is your house.

514
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,810
But, is your son home?

515
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,550
Yes. They went up to the rooftop for a little bit.

516
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,620
Oh, is that so? Then that's good. We're already here,

517
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,980
so let's leave after we greet them.

518
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,190
Last time, I was going to say hello
to your son at the funeral service.

519
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,990
I lost track of things and didn't even say hello.

520
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:09,360
Then, will you do so? Stay and have a cup of tea.

521
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,100
Oh, Unni. Why are you being like this? I'll do it.

522
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,370
- Ah, the guest shouldn't do this. Sit.  - Oh no.

523
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,240
The boiler is sold at the dealer's.

524
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,110
I asked you to fix it last time!

525
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:25,040
- You're the one who didn't fix it for me!
- So I'm telling you to fix it yourself!

526
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,820
Goo Baek's Dad!

527
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,190
Jay Kim?

528
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,730
Can I speak to you two?

529
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,030
Why?

530
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,730
I have something to say to you two.

531
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,270
What do we do? I was uneasy.

532
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:00,150
I didn't know they would come to our home. But
why did Cheong take those people into that room?

533
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,210
It will be fine.

534
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,450
Where did the guests go?

535
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,450
Momentarily...

536
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:12,560
Oh my. Why are they coming out of the room?

537
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,900
No, we were just looking at the room.
This place is so nice.

538
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,830
Oh my, is this your son?

539
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:25,270
Yes, my son Heo Joon Jae is here.

540
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:27,910
This man is his friend, Jo Nam Doo.

541
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,310
And you have been introduced to Cheong, right?

542
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,910
Yes, we have. This young lady is so friendly.

543
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,720
Your son is so handsome.

544
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,050
And, his friend, too... so unique.

545
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:49,030
But... I...think I have seen you somewhere before.

546
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,900
Your faces feel very familiar.

547
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,770
We met before, right? Dubai?

548
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,770
We've never been to Dubai.

549
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,740
Oh my! Right!

550
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:08,510
But why did the three syllable word Du-ba-ee
(Dubai in Korean) appear in my head?

551
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,320
I wonder why.

552
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,120
I'm sorry. I'm babbling on.

553
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,530
Anyway, it's so nice to meet you,

554
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:25,200
and let's meet each other often now.

555
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,940
Think carefully.

556
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:38,780
Cheong isn't made for mermaid shows!
She erased her memory!

557
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,440
You erased my memories last time too!

558
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,120
And that was why Joon Jae was acting
like that after returning from Spain.

559
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,320
Just try saying this out loud somewhere.

560
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:52,520
Cheong, let's work together. If you
can use this memory erasing skill well,

561
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,890
we're just applying Bill Gates.
We just become worldwide billionaires.

562
00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:00,470
Don't bother. I won't be a billionaire.
It will make me uselessly busy.

563
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,070
If I'm busy, I won't have time to see Heo Joon Jae.

564
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,900
That's right.

565
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,310
Cheong, I'm saying this sincerely. If you break
up with Joon Jae, you have to come to me.

566
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,710
I pulled number 2, okay?

567
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,180
What is this rascal saying?

568
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,520
Ah, really. Cheong. I really, really
like you. Why do you have so many things?

569
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,820
Hey!

570
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,090
Hey, don't do that.

571
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:21,450
- Just one time. - Don't do it.

572
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,860
- Just one hug. - Why are you hugging her?

573
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,260
Cheong. Wait.

574
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,660
Hey, what are you doing?

575
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,160
He must be insane.

576
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,570
What's the matter? Why? Cheong?

577
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,500
What's wrong? Are you hurting somewhere?

578
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,570
Hey, maybe you got discharged
from the hospital too soon.

579
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,580
Does your heart hurt?

580
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:05,800
♬ The door to a new world is open. ♬

581
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:11,140
♬  It is within you. ♬

582
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:20,280
♬  When I enter my eyes are dazzled ♬

583
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:30,260
♬ A wide world welcomes me ♬

584
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:39,430
♬ I approach you. I want to be embraced. ♬

585
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,100
♬ I want to stay in that world which is you. ♬

586
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,470
Where did everyone go?

587
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,470
I sent them away.

588
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,940
Why?  ♬ I love you. ♬

589
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,040
Because I wanted to eat with you alone.

590
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,910
♬  I need you I love you  ♬

591
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:55,980
♬  Eternally in your arms ♬

592
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,650
Since your condition isn't good, don't go
anywhere. Let's have a party here by ourselves.

593
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,790
Go and change your clothes.

594
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:15,930
♬ Will you come to me and take my hand ♬

595
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:22,840
♬ I will love you even if the world changes. ♬

596
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:26,710
♬  I owe you I miss you  ♬

597
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:31,380
♬  I need you I love you  ♬

598
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:38,360
♬  Eternally in your arms ♬

599
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,940
Shall we have a drink?

600
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,440
No.

601
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:06,120
If I drink, I think I'll ask you to stay.

602
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:12,320
If there's another way, tell me.

603
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:19,870
Please. Tell me there is one.

604
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,900
Since your surgery, you barely eat.

605
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,510
You can't sleep and you hold in your pain.

606
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:36,480
What am I supposed to do?
Must I continue like this

607
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:41,850
just watching you die?

608
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:11,620
If you return to the sea, will you be okay?

609
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,890
Will you be healthy?

610
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:34,070
Promise me one thing.

611
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:40,150
That as you are leaving,
you won't erase my memories.

612
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,720
Why?

613
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,220
You said it, too.

614
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,070
Rather than unable to love because
you can't remember,

615
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,690
it is better to love even though it hurts.

616
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,700
Because there will be memories I
share with you, I can let you go.

617
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:10,280
Then you become too pitiable. I might
not be able to come back for a lifetime.

618
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:14,780
Then you won't even know if I'm dead or alive.

619
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,520
You will have to continue to wait.

620
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:26,290
If you cannot come back for a
lifetime, I'll be born again.

621
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,100
You do that as well.

622
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,100
I told you.

623
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,730
My love

624
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,100
is longer than my time.

625
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,040
I wish you would become at peace.

626
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:50,480
If we remember each other...
we won't lose the way back.

627
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,790
So, ultimately we will meet again.

628
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,260
Fine.

629
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:13,770
Then you choose.
Whether to erase or leave it as it is.

630
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,180
I said you can choose.

631
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:35,130
I have made my choice.

632
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:59,220
♬ Did I wake up from a long dream? ♬

633
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,520
♬ As soon as I recognized you ♬

634
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,860
♬ My nameless love ♬

635
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:12,330
♬ may have started ♬

636
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:21,140
♬ Before I knew you was the sky ♬

637
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:29,880
♬ always as brilliant? ♬

638
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:38,590
♬ If out of ten thousand
chances our love came to be ♬

639
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:46,670
♬ If out of ten thousand
chances you and I could begin ♬

640
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:51,140
♬ I will use the feeling and ♬

641
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:55,210
♬ the love which may not end ♬

642
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:59,950
♬ for you ♬

643
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:07,150
♬ All of my moments are for you ♬

644
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,470
♬ With you I see and hear more,  ♬

645
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,200
♬ Breathing with you will be everything ♬
