Episode 4

2
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,960
Sir, last night in many villages along the coast,
they say there were strange occurrences.

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,900
Clothes that were hung in the
backyards and shoes disappeared.

4
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,170
In their place,
they say a rare quality pearl was left.

5
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,740
A pearl?

6
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,310
Oh my!

7
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,470
How can there be a burglar

8
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,150
who takes only a few clothes
and leaves such a thing as a pearl behind?

9
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,520
If only the burglar also decided to stop by here...

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,890
Look here, Hong Nan. Half your dresser is pearls
and precious treasures of gold and silver.

11
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,720
I apologize that this concubine is
overflowing with materialistic greed.

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,160
Since I am not able to completely
have my spouse to myself,

13
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,900
just think that I am compensating
for that emptiness with material goods.

14
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,200
What I mean is, Hong Nan,

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,370
I'm saying that I will fill that other
half of your dresser with jewels.

16
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,840
How long would that take...?

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,410
Even though I'm busy as you can see, do you
know why I'm on fire trying to catch a mermaid?

18
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,520
If I catch a mermaid, I can beat her and extract
her tears again and again until she dies

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,820
so that underneath each step you take
can be adorned lavishly with pearls.

20
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,030
That's my plan.

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,100
And you have a way to catch one?

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,270
Method or not, that one will come back on her own.

23
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,570
Don't you think so, Caretaker Cheon?

24
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,210
That's right. From the old times,
mermaids would come up to the village

25
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,780
and wear clothes or eat food.
They were sure to pay for them

26
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,850
with rare pearls that can
only be found in the deep sea.

27
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,920
So are you saying that the
clothing thief was a mermaid?

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,090
Are you saying a mermaid came up to this village?

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,100
A mermaid who has fallen for
a human always comes to land.

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,870
That is part of their inherent nature.

31
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,080
The mermaid who
can only love once in her lifetime

32
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,850
stakes her life on that one love.

33
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,250
For the mermaid, her one true love has appeared

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,130
and for me the
lone opportunity has presented itself.

35
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,290
Let's do it like this, Caretaker Cheon.

36
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,900
Put out people to catch the mermaid
before the village head does.

37
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,930
Hong Nan, you do your best to make sure a vicious
rumor is circulated as swift as possible.

38
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,740
By vicious rumor you mean...?

39
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,570
The vicious rumor should be that

40
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,380
recently a huge storm has caused
the fishing boats to go missing,

41
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,350
ruined houses and fields, and made the
mountain collapse which killed all the fish.

42
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,880
It is all because of that bad omen, a mermaid.

43
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,890
Since all of that happened on the night when
the mermaid was washed ashore and was caught,

44
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,060
it truly seems plausible.

45
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,090
This kid's smart.

46
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,900
But that ominous mermaid

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,320
with malicious intent selfishly hid herself

48
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,170
deep inside the village while
taking human form.

49
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,010
And if we don't stop her,
an even bigger calamity will unfold.

50
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,940
Many people will be injured and die.

51
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,170
In five days time,

52
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,710
there are many fishing boats scheduled
to go out to the Usan area to catch squid.

53
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,620
They'll be brimming with
concern over the wind and waves.

54
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,320
There's no better timing than this!

55
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,030
There's nothing better than fear
to stop the people's thoughts.

56
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,370
The village head won't be able to
go against terrified villagers.

57
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,070
Of course, sir.

58
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:55,070
If we're good, we can also force the village head
into a deadly situation along with the mermaid.

59
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,280
Naive love is giving me great joy.

60
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,050
Aigoo, the mermaid that was caught that day

61
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,950
has returned and is back on land, have you heard?

62
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,620
I heard she came for revenge!

63
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,990
They say that storm was caused by the mermaid!

64
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,380
Aigoo, what can be done?

65
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,600
If we get a storm again, isn't my husband going to
return as a sea ghost if he rides out in his boat?

66
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,000
- Then we need to immediately capture
and kill that wily thing! - Exactly!

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,170
What's the village head doing?!

68
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,910
Village Head! They say the mermaid
has come up to the village!

69
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,010
Everyone is about to die!

70
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,140
I'm saying you can't come here and be like this!

71
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,650
I got the message so please go back!

72
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,620
Look, have you finally lost your mind?

73
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,810
Didn't you just receive the report on

74
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,190
what kind of strange rumors are circulating
within the administrative district?

75
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,290
But what? For whom are you going to look?

76
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,330
I think Sae Hwa came to see me.
I had requested it last time.

77
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,600
I asked her to come see
me at the 20th solar division,

78
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,300
and I told her that I want to be
able to see the first snow with her.

79
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,600
I mean... Look here. For someone who's
educated, why are you being like this?

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,110
The subdivisions in the year are just that.

81
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,640
Just because it is November 22th,
it doesn't mean that snow will be falling—

82
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,810
Dam Ryeong! Dam Ryeong!

83
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,410
You can't!

84
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,050
If she really came to land,
that means she risked her life.

85
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,190
The same goes for me.
What am I not able to stake at this point?

86
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,330
Think of your family! Think of your father!
Your honor and position!

87
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,420
On Shin An's Docho Island, Yeosu's Geomoon
Island, and Incheon's Jangbong Island,

88
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,360
I asked the elders from the places where the
mermaids frequent and there is only one answer.

89
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,930
The biggest weakness of
the mermaid who comes onto land

90
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,140
is her legs. After her legs are severely wounded

91
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,870
she will lose all her strength.
When abandoned she will die.

92
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,480
Thus you must not
forget to attack her legs first.

93
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,910
Legend of the Blue Sea

94
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,880
The whereabouts of Ma Dae Young,

95
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,050
who was jailed in the Seoul
Correctional Facility on murder charges,

96
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,240
have been unknown for the last three months.

97
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,060
Unlike the initial prediction
by the police that he'll soon be apprehended,

98
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,730
there isn't any headway in the investigation,
thus elevating the fears of the citizens.

99
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,630
Police have not ruled out the chance that

100
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,830
Mr. Ma might have an accomplice
in his escape and are continuing the investigation.

101
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,700
To find out the underlying motivation
behind his jailbreak, police

102
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,370
are deeply investigating Mr. Ma's financial
relationships and animosities.

103
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,610
- That crazy bastard.

104
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,540
Yes, Ahjumma. You also packed
the crabs in soy sauce, right?

105
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,910
Oh, my. What would happen if I brought
this as is and the sauce leaked all over?

106
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,650
I already told you before, time and again.

107
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,590
If I ask to have food for take out,
you should pay special attention to it.

108
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,560
Look here, do you see the clasps?
I locked them shut, so

109
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,990
be sure to hold it upright properly.

110
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,970
I should have it stand like this?

111
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't put it in the trunk,

112
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,300
but place it on the floor in the
car and be sure to secure it well.

113
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,610
On the car's floor? Securely?

114
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,910
You should be careful when you carry it.

115
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,710
Okay.

116
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,550
But who is whose superior?

117
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,120
Oh, my! So funny. I'm speechless.

118
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,800
Yes, Madam. It's me, Jin Joo.

119
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,640
It's just that I have some side dishes that I
think would match your taste and thought of you.

120
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,710
Yes, please taste them.

121
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,350
Wow, Mother.
There are so many delicious things today.

122
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,320
Jin Joo gave them to us,
saying they were made at her house.

123
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,360
Your sister's working real hard to
make things work with our Chi Hyeon.

124
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,800
Is that so? If those who it concerns
are fine then... well then that's that.

125
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,370
No, Father. I'm fine with
everything if my parents like it.

126
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:02,110
Honey, our Chi Hyeon is like this.
Others say he's a papa's boy.

127
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,410
It's not good to be that too much.

128
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,950
Why?

129
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,930
- How is it? - Don't make me speak.

130
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,030
- It's too delicious. - Right?

131
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,760
Is it good, Heo Joon Jae?

132
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,870
Don't make me speak. It's too delicious.

133
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,210
Aigoo, we gave you the name 'Joon Jae' for you
to become a para-chaebol ('joon chaebol')

134
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,670
But in order for our son to be a para-chaebol,

135
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,080
don't you have to be
a chaebol (conglomerate owner) first, Honey?

136
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,950
- When are you going to become a chaebol?
- Wait just a little bit. Just a little bit.

137
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,620
I'm going to make you a madam, and you'll
be wearing luxury goods from head to toe.

138
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,520
See if you don't!

139
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,530
Here, eat the meaty part.

140
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,060
Why, Honey? Does it not match your tastes?

141
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,930
No, it's really good. You try it too.

142
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,270
- Chi Hyeon. - Yes, Father? - You try it too.

143
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,610
Ah no, Father. I have a shellfish allergy.

144
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,250
Honey, eat up! I heard Jin Joo
hired some new domestic help.

145
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,320
They must have picked someone good now.

146
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,120
Honey...?

147
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,570
General Manager Nam.

148
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,900
Yes?

149
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,570
Perhaps... do you keep in
touch with Joon Jae these days?

150
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,380
It's your son's birthday today,
so you must have thought about him.

151
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,750
I have come to conclude that until this
summer, he lived near Samsung-dong.

152
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,950
But it seems he has moved out again.

153
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,350
It's hard to find out his address.

154
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,720
I wonder what he's been doing... that pathetic punk.

155
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,730
Now, you should make up.

156
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,460
Make what up? Between a father and a son.

157
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:11,070
I'm saying it because it's you. But the
only blood relative I have is Joon Jae.

158
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,770
Now I need to find him and have him
beside me. I have a lot to teach him.

159
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,380
Can you get him?

160
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,160
It's me.

161
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,730
It's his birthday today.

162
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,000
He'll appear there.

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,070
Find out where he is.

164
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,580
When you find out, make him disappear.

165
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,980
Do you know me?

166
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,050
I'll ask again.

167
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,760
Do you know me?

168
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,000
Hey, over there! Please hold onto her.
Why is she so fast?

169
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,400
Aigoo. Thank you. She's someone who went
into our facilities without our permission.

170
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,040
We need to investigate her.

171
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,570
- I know. - Pardon?

172
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,820
I am Detective Hong Dok Kyeong from
the Myeongdong Violent Crimes Department.

173
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,280
I received a report.

174
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,420
Already? Who reported her?

175
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,060
- I didn't.- Maybe the security team reported it.

176
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,330
- Are you the one in charge? - Oh, yes I am.

177
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,480
Breaking and entering tends to have a purpose

178
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,770
and it seems like it would be
very difficult without inside help.

179
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,470
Later, I might need to investigate witnesses.
When that time comes I will call you.

180
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,010
Ah, yes. I understand.

181
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,080
We need to go together.

182
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,090
She's someone who's getting apprehended, right?

183
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,130
I didn't get you out to save you.

184
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,070
There's something I need to know,
so give me an answer.

185
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,140
This. Why were we together?

186
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,350
Why am I in here with Heo Joon Jae?

187
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,190
You know my name, too?

188
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,530
You know me, right?

189
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,460
You don't know?

190
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,470
You do know or you don't know?

191
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,340
You know me. You know my name too.

192
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,210
It's true that we were in Spain together.

193
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,580
But why do I not know you? Who are you?

194
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,180
Who are you?

195
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,890
Fine.

196
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,960
What's your name? (using formal speech)

197
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,530
I don't have a name. (using informal speech)

198
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,930
- You don't have a name?  - Nope.

199
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,140
I don't have a name,
but I was told I'm not a strange person.

200
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,240
- By whom?  - A good person.

201
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,880
I'm not sure what kind of person he/she was, but
there's a good chance he is a strange person, too.

202
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,220
Your words and actions...
Everything is strange, you know?

203
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,560
Do you not speak Korean well?
Are you a Korean who lives overseas?

204
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,130
I'm going to ask you for the last time.

205
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,140
What happened between us in Spain?

206
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,580
I'm pretty sure I met you,
but why don't I remember anything?

207
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,550
Was there an accident that
happened that I don't know about?

208
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,720
You don't have anything to say to me, right?

209
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,100
There's a lot that I'm curious about you,
but you don't have anything to say to me...

210
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,940
So isn't it useless to keep being together?

211
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,830
Why? You have something to say to me?

212
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,630
Then don't follow me.

213
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,620
Hangang Park

214
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,230
Your nose is really good right now!

215
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,430
Don't ever do surgery.

216
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,700
Ah, I'm not a strange person.

217
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,300
I'm not someone
who's preaching the Tao or anything.

218
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,960
I'm just a Buddhist ascetic you know?

219
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,410
Any Buddhist ascetic can see everything,
even when he tries not to.

220
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,840
What do you see?

221
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,780
Miss, you don't have any luck with your ancestors

222
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,250
but your nose is blocking a
lot of bad energy. But then...

223
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:17,020
It's ambiguous. No matter how nice your nose is,
the lack of ancestral blessings is stronger.

224
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,330
In the ground, your ancestors are crying.

225
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,890
What are ancestors?

226
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,560
What do you mean what are...?

227
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,400
The people who gave birth to you,
the people who gave birth to them,

228
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,440
and the people who gave
birth to them are those people.

229
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,970
Your roots! Your origin.

230
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,610
They wouldn't be underground.

231
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,680
If they're not in the ground, then wh-wh-where?

232
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,820
Underwater?

233
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,190
Ah! They weren't buried.

234
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,160
So after cremation, you spread their
ashes over the river or sea, I see.

235
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,630
Well, wherever it is...

236
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,530
What's important is that
your ancestors are crying.

237
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,630
- Why are they crying?- What do you mean "why"?

238
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,070
It's because their descendants
aren't doing their duty (gong).

239
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,440
Look at this.

240
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,450
Gong

241
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,350
This 'gong,' okay? With this 'gong,'

242
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,520
if you read it backwards, what does it become?

243
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,620
You know how the word 'nim' (님, means loved one) turns
into 'nam' (남, stranger) if you put a dot in it?

244
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,830
It's the same concept! Look.

245
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,930
If you read this 'gong' backwards...?

246
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,530
Woon

247
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,270
Ah, really. Come over here.

248
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,340
Here, here.

249
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,140
What does it say?

250
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,250
That's right! It's 'woon' (fortune)!
That's right!

251
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,690
What does this mean? If you do your 'gong'
(duty), then 'woon' (fortune) will also follow.

252
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,930
Wow! This truth is so scientific and proven!

253
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,930
That's what I'm saying.

254
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,940
You have a strong energy.

255
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,410
You are not only strong, but sassy, too.

256
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,680
Excuse me, first, if you go to the parking lot,

257
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,150
our minivan is there on standby.
Why don't you go there?

258
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,600
Why? What? Who are you?

259
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,300
Me? Your ancestor.

260
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,240
After crying on and
on while I was in the underworld,

261
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,390
I thought that if I continued
to neglect my descendant,

262
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,840
the whole world would turn into a shitshow,

263
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,210
so I came here personally to get you,
to take you away.

264
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,050
Wow, really. Who are yo—

265
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,530
Ah, this man. Oh?

266
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,210
Aish, this jerk! Are you a pick-pocket?

267
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,410
I'm going to report you immediately.
I'm going to report you!

268
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,950
You're going to regret it!
If I report you... (using informal speech)

269
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,220
Please give it to me, sir. (using formal speech)

270
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,760
If you give it to me right now,
I'l leave quietly. (formal speech)

271
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,100
It's because I can't have my identity leaked.

272
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,570
Ah, it's really cold.

273
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,580
I'm telling you this because it seems
you don't really know what's going on.

274
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,440
You can't follow people like that man.

275
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,380
They'll say you need to do memorial
rites and whatever. They will rip you off a lot.

276
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,020
Okay?

277
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,340
Dog Nam Doo

278
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,910
Yeah, why?

279
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,280
Ah, what are you going? What's wrong with you?

280
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,020
It's a gun!

281
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,390
A gun?

282
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,960
Ah, it's not a gun.

283
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,730
Stay still, Joon Jae. I'll protect you.

284
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,300
Ah, no, who's protecting who?

285
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,830
Sheesh.

286
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,210
Open your eyes. Trust what I am saying.

287
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,450
Look at the sky.

288
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:17,790
♬  Your gaze more than any word is meaningful. ♬

289
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,230
Listen well. Protecting others...
♬  I can sense it ♬

290
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,260
comes after protecting yourself.
The order is like that.

291
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,730
It's a stupid thing
to switch the order. Understand?

292
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,400
It's not hot?

293
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,800
Are you listening to me?

294
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,210
That... It isn't hot if you touch it?

295
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,950
Is this really your first time
seeing fireworks?

296
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,120
Fireworks?

297
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,390
There is a place called the Han River. In the
fall, they have a fireworks display there.

298
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,360
Wow, that's incredibly beautiful.

299
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,960
I'll let you watch it with me.

300
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,500
Fireworks display?

301
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,170
That's right.
Is this really your first time seeing it?

302
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,540
You can't touch it. Look,
as soon as it explodes, it disappears.

303
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,610
♬ From the moment you came to me . ♬

304
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,650
♬ Come a step closer. ♬

305
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,730
♬ So I can even feel your breath ♬

306
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,460
♬ My heart is tilting towards you ♬

307
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,770
♬ Bit by bit, bit by bit. ♬

308
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,570
Why is everyone doing this?

309
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,310
They're taking pictures.

310
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,880
Taking pictures? What is that?

311
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,850
Ah, are you asking because you really don't know?

312
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,660
♬ Why is it like a miracle everyday. ♬

313
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,530
Here, like this.

314
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,060
"Ah," what even.

315
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,600
But why aren't you taking pictures?
Everyone else is.

316
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,940
Because I can just remember it.

317
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,950
You're keeping it here, aren't you?

318
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,990
Usually, good and pretty things
disappear quickly, Joon Jae.

319
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,300
Like this, with your eyes, you look at it well,

320
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:45,000
and then you keep it in your heart like this.

321
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,810
Then later when you have a sad
day, you think about it.

322
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,210
You go, "At that time, the fireworks
in the sky were really pretty."

323
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,750
"Ah, that day was really good."

324
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,690
Mom, we're going to come again next time, right?

325
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,490
- Of course. - And the next time too?

326
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,460
- Of course! - And the next time.

327
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,590
- Of course! - It's for real.

328
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,460
For sure!

329
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,570
But why do you keep speaking informally?
(speaking formally)

330
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,640
I'm going to speak informally now too then.
(speaking informally)

331
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,100
In order to watch this spectacular show,

332
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,730
over 1 million people are
gathered around the Han River.

333
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,570
Should we watch golf?

334
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,140
Wait a minute...

335
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,140
No, Ahjumm—

336
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,730
...until 9:30 p.m., vehicular
traffic will be prohibited.

337
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,080
Never mind. You can watch golf now.

338
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,280
Thank you.

339
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,260
What "thank you"?

340
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,690
This is our TV; this is our house.

341
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,130
Why are you following
the Ahjumma's words exactly?

342
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,400
I don't know. Weirdly,
every time she orders something, I do it.

343
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,510
Yeah.

344
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,780
I'm following him right now,

345
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,050
but he's with some girl.

346
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,880
But how did you know he would be here today?

347
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,250
He has done that since he was young.

348
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,660
Even after growing up, he hasn't fixed his habit.

349
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,160
Joon Jae, where are you going?

350
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,030
My mom and I planned to meet
each other on my birthday.

351
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,630
Mom will be waiting.

352
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,540
Let go. Let go!

353
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,270
Is that so? Then go.

354
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,480
Your mom won't be there

355
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,680
because your father gave her a lot of money.

356
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,720
But if she meets you,
she has to return all of that money.

357
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,920
Why do you think your mother
left you without a word?

358
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,260
It's because she likes the money
way more than she likes you.

359
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:25,130
No! No, my mom isn't like that.

360
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,800
My mom isn't like that!

361
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
What's with him now?

362
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,900
He said he's meeting his mother.

363
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,340
This bast***.

364
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,180
Go to your room!

365
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,320
Why are you shouting at him
when it's over something sad?!

366
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,750
No, no, my mom...

367
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,620
My mom will come to see me.

368
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,960
Joon Jae, don't cry.
Your step-mother will be sad too.

369
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,370
Joon Jae, I'm sorry.

370
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,300
Do you know how much effort
I've put into this house?

371
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,940
Now that it's time to clarify the
inheritors, he looks for his son?

372
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,810
Be sure to find out where he lives today.

373
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,510
Okay?

374
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,780
I need to live for you to live.

375
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,450
Hang up. He's moving.

376
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,330
Why do you keep following me? I said I needed to go.

377
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,700
What?

378
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,040
Can't I go with you?

379
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,440
Together? Where? My house?

380
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,210
Yeah.

381
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,950
No.

382
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,350
Why?

383
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,290
Of course, you can't. How could a
full grown woman go to a man's house?

384
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,220
If your parents knew, what would they say?

385
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,820
I don't have any parents.

386
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,430
Then answer me. We know each other, right?
Something happened, right?

387
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,770
See?

388
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:18,640
On what basis do I bring you,
a girl with so many secrets home?

389
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,950
Give me your hand.

390
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,020
If you have something to say to me
later, contact me then.

391
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,040
I don't know.

392
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,140
I don't know her. What am I supposed to do?

393
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,340
I feel really great because I'm in Seoul.

394
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,010
You really don't know Seoul?

395
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,910
What was that?

396
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,390
It's cold. I'm closing the window.

397
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,830
I really like that I'm with you.

398
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,800
I love you.

399
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,380
Hey, I'm trying to compare something.

400
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,810
Say it to me.

401
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,350
Huh? What?

402
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,250
That. That "I lo..."

403
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,690
Never mind. Do it later.

404
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,470
Ah, who's this guy now?

405
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,550
Are you still looking at that?

406
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,020
Oh right.

407
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,620
Have you seen a drawing such
as this on other artifacts?

408
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,420
There's none.

409
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,060
For a blue celadon vase from the Joseon
Dynasty period, its pattern is quite modern.

410
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,530
How could a person from the Joseon
Dynasty draw something like this?

411
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,200
The Professor said it might have been that the
painter rode a time machine and saw the future.

412
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Somehow...

413
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,270
it feels very similar to someone I know.

414
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,610
Who?

415
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,380
There's someone.
Someone's birthday is today.

416
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,650
Come inside.

417
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:52,180
Hey! How can you bring her home? Are you crazy?

418
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,950
Did she hear?

419
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,030
Is there nothing to eat in here?

420
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,500
Why would something to eat be in there?
Come over here.

421
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,460
What?

422
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,410
Hey, miss, where is your house?

423
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,070
It's quite far.

424
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,480
Mine's far too. It's in Namyangju.

425
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,480
Mine's rea...

426
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,220
...lly far away.

427
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,170
You're not the type to lose to anyone.

428
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,820
You always want the last word
and your fashion sense is weird too.

429
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,060
She doesn't match with me.
Joon Jae, she is not a good match for me.

430
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,860
What would you do if she did match well with you,
Hyung? Is someone setting up a blind date for you?

431
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,090
But even so, we'll be living together.

432
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,630
"Living together," my butt!

433
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,370
You two are mooching off of me right now.
You guys should leave now.

434
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,270
Oh, my. This guy is sly.

435
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,670
If Tae Oh and I leave together, what are
you guys going to do in one house together?

436
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,870
I mean, would I keep this girl with me?

437
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,240
I brought her because there's
something I have to check.

438
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,050
What are you checking?
Hey, don't take it out! Don't take it out!

439
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,790
You... know about this, right?

440
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,260
You know about it, right?

441
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,140
- Yeah. - Is it yours?

442
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,900
I gave it to you.

443
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,410
Oh... so she gave it to you, huh?
A no-strings-attached gift!

444
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,050
You gave this to me?

445
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,850
Yeah. Because you liked it.

446
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,780
Yeah, he probably did like it.

447
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,290
But it isn't an object that can
be given just because he liked it.

448
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,120
Oh, you're really kind. You're kind in nature.

449
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,930
There are a lot of things like this in my house.

450
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,970
You have a lot?

451
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,750
Yeah, if you just search around, there is a lot.

452
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,250
Is that so? There is a lot if you search around.

453
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,390
Joon Jae, let's let her stay at
our house for a moment.

454
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,990
Look at you talking about her staying here.

455
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,480
I feel sorry for her.
She said she doesn't know anyone in Seoul.

456
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,830
But do you really have
a lot of this stuff at home?

457
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,760
Yeah.

458
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,630
We... No, this oppa will help you
with this harsh life in Seoul.

459
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,900
I'll be responsible for you.

460
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,010
Instead, you can't forget
that I helped you. This fact!

461
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,410
This fact must never be forgotten.

462
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,680
If you want to repay my kindness when
you return home, you can do that, too.

463
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,180
Forget it.

464
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,220
You know the bracelet, but you don't
know me, to whom you gave the bracelet?

465
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,150
Do you think that makes sense?

466
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,060
See? She talks so well, but when an
important topic comes up, she won't speak!

467
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,760
Hey, don't berate her. There must be a situation.

468
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,960
But, Little Sister, what's your name?

469
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,870
She says she doesn't have one.

470
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,800
She... she doesn't have one?

471
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,440
- Why do people keep asking whether I have
a name? - That's an interesting question.

472
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,680
How refreshing. The reason people ask is so
that they have to have a name to call you.

473
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,910
They can't call me if I don't have a name?

474
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,620
It'll be a bit ambiguous, I guess?
It's easier to call people with a name.

475
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,920
If I have a name, will you say it out loud?

476
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,130
- I guess I will if I have to.
- Then make me a name.

477
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,960
- Make what? Is this a naming agency?
- Give me a name!

478
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,200
A name comes from the feeling
when you look at that person.

479
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,240
The image of that person. When I look at
you, I think of Hepburn. Audrey Hepburn.

480
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,800
If you watch the movie Roman Holiday,

481
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,680
the innocent princess would
roam around not knowing anything.

482
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,710
Shall I say I could feel such naiveté?

483
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,420
What about that name? Oh Deu Ree (sounds like
Audrey.) Last name Oh. First name Deu Ree.

484
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,060
Audrey, my butt! Just be Sim Cheong.

485
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,760
What! Is she the blind man Sim's daughter?

486
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,000
She's extremely dumb. So Sim (extremely)
Cheong (a way of saying stupid) is just right.

487
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,270
How could you be so insincere in naming a person?

488
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,500
I like it.

489
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,470
What are you saying?
He's teasing you that you're stupid!

490
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,770
I like that name. Sim Cheong. I like it.

491
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,080
- It fits her. You have a knack for naming.
- Right?

492
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,960
What's your name?

493
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,290
I'm Tae Oh.

494
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,630
I'm Sim Cheong.

495
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,380
But still, it's your birthday so I thought that

496
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,450
you should at least light some
birthday candles on your birthday cake.

497
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,160
On my way home...

498
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,800
You had a guest! Who is she?

499
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,200
Ah... she's...

500
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,610
Hello. I'm Sim Cheong.

501
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,080
I see...

502
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,720
- Ah, that scared me!  - What are you doing?!

503
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,790
Why are you like this? Get off of me! I said!

504
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,090
Get off!

505
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,760
- Ah, I'm scared!- I'm even more afraid of YOU!

506
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,130
- Let's eat!- Hey, hey, hey!

507
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,970
You eat this after you blow out the candles.

508
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,570
Let's sing the happy birthday song!

509
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,040
♬ Happy birthday to you-

510
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,520
Eat it after taking out the candles.
There, there our Cheong.

511
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,850
Here. There you go.

512
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,820
Oh my god.

513
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,600
Is anyone going to steal it away from you?
Eat it slowly.

514
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,400
Joon Jae, you have some, too.

515
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,670
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

516
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,280
Hey. Eat it from her. Si Ah must feel embarrassed.

517
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,350
Seriously.

518
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,200
Oh, right. Joon Jae,

519
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,720
you will go with me to Professor Jin's
retirement party next week, right?

520
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,420
I will be meeting with him tomorrow separately.
I also have something to talk to him about.

521
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,790
Professor Jin was so disappointed
whenever he started a new project.

522
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,830
- He's saying how it would have been nice if
you were there to help. - I should help him.

523
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,470
So will she be here in the meantime?

524
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,480
I tried to stop him too. I did.

525
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,910
But Joon Jae is weak against just causes.
She also seems mentally unstable and all.

526
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,290
I think it triggered his compassion
for her sorry circumstances.

527
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,120
But don't worry yourself over it!

528
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,360
Why should the invincible,

529
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,320
Cha Si Ah concern herself over a girl
who doesn't even know her own name?

530
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,790
I don't know.

531
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,080
You should hold still and not leave this house.

532
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,000
So that the two of them aren't left by themselves.

533
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,830
- Fine.  - What I mean is

534
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,440
there's no free room,
so where is she going to sleep anyway?

535
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,870
Actually, there is another room.

536
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,780
Come up.

537
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,360
Do I live here?

538
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,500
Get your senses together. What do you mean "live"?

539
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,330
I'm letting you stay briefly because
I have something to find out.

540
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,400
It's only for a few days.

541
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,840
Aigoo.

542
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,750
Thanks, Heo Joon Jae.

543
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,220
Of course, you should be thankful.

544
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,520
Now be quiet and go to sleep.

545
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,390
Okay!

546
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,770
Hey! I can hear everything!

547
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:46,210
♬  Far above the sea  ♬

548
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,580
♬ Without any sound ♬

549
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,640
I'm someone who so hates the
disturbances between floors

550
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,480
that I chose to live in a standalone house.

551
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,890
Do you want to get kicked out
in the middle of the night?

552
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:14,410
♬ My heart which was wandering
and crossing over the waves ♬

553
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:22,410
♬ waits for you to come back to the sea ♬

554
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:18,470
Heo Joon Jae! It's morning. Let's eat breakfast!

555
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,050
The delicious meal is cooking.

556
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:31,180
Right, start.
It would be better if you would hurry.

557
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,150
You're doing all sorts of things.

558
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,890
Wow! It's nice how this feels like a home.

559
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,430
Hey, where did all the milk go?

560
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,860
There's one person who drank it in one shot
saying she's hungry while waiting for the food.

561
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,730
This household's going to go broke I see.

562
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,270
You just said you liked
it because it felt like home.

563
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,640
Though I'm older, it's not like I
can always be right about everything.

564
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,930
- Who are you? - Do you read the newspapers?

565
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,190
I'm from Myeonsung Daily News.
If you get the papers, we are giving cash away.

566
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,990
I have something that I read already.
Sorry. Thank you so much.

567
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,300
Hello, do you read the newspaper?

568
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,870
Is anyone in there?

569
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,200
Excuse me, do you read the newspaper?
Do you read the newspaper!

570
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,040
Is there anyone home? Do you read the newspaper!

571
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,620
Is there anyone home?

572
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,460
If you read the newspaper,
we are offering some cash.

573
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,630
I don't! Just because of this,
you woke up a sleeping person?

574
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,240
Hey! What are you doing?

575
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,440
I saw what you were doing!
What kind of symbol are you marking down?

576
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,980
You are a petty thief, right? You trashy
bastard. Stay right there and don't you move.

577
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,020
This bastard.

578
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,390
What are you doing, you crazy bastard?

579
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,230
Work hard.

580
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,470
What is it?

581
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,640
Why did I go there?

582
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:52,360
I fell and hurt my head.

583
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,330
This is for certain.

584
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,870
What is it, seriously?

585
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:25,620
Yes, Hyung?

586
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,060
Joon Jae, stop. Stop.

587
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,900
- What?  - Look out front.

588
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,440
Hey.

589
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,240
What is it? What happened?

590
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,750
You know next door? What on earth!
There's a murder case.

591
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,220
- What?- I also called Tae Ho
and told him not to come home.

592
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,490
Hurry and turn the car around.
Detective Hong is out there.

593
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:58,420
Detective Hong, who is so bent on catching
you. He also saw your face three years ago.

594
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,200
38HEO-3023

595
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,400
What are you doing? I said turn the car around.

596
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,460
Cheong is alone at home.

597
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,330
What does it matter if she's alone for a
short while? Hurry and turn the car around.

598
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,970
If you keep on staying here, they
will be suspicious. Hurry!  Checkpoint

599
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,780
I said, let's do a comprehensive investigation.

600
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,610
Why are you doing this? It's not even
in your district, Detective Hong.

601
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:26,850
I heard the murder weapons were a nail
and hammer. It's definitely Ma Dae Young.

602
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,420
Is Ma Dae Young the only one
who uses a hammer to murder?

603
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,160
The victim was a loan shark,
so it's obviously 100% revenge.

604
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,000
Where do you find a 100% on a case?

605
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,630
First, let's look at the
possibility and start the investigation.

606
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,530
If not, then I'll step out if it.

607
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,720
Why isn't Heo Joon Jae coming?

608
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:12,930
Hey! You shouldn't have appeared in front of me!

609
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,770
What are you hiding from me?

610
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:19,170
You should have lived without knowing!

611
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,270
Even if you didn't say anything—

612
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,550
Let me tell you a secret.

613
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,450
Your father is...

614
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,620
Next time on...

615
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,460
What's wrong? Move.

616
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:41,490
Speak. Is she dead?

617
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,070
Is it Heo Joon Jae?

618
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,150
Listen carefully.

619
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,880
Protecting someone else is after
protecting yourself. That's how the order is.

620
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,050
Changing that order is only something
stupid people do. Do you understand?

621
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,040
Hyung, move.

622
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,500
Huh?

623
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,240
If you don't want to be stupid, then move.

624
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,080
What did you say? Hey! Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!

625
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:36,920
Hey!

626
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,170
Sa Wol. Sa Wol.

627
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,940
Yes, Madam.

628
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:04,580
Today is such a nice day, so be sure to open all the
paste jars. (All the large brown jars everywhere)

629
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,250
That way they will get light
and the paste will taste better.

630
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,490
All of them?

631
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,390
Is it too difficult?

632
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,330
Well...

633
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,730
Should I do it?

634
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:29,940
No, Madam. I should do it.

635
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,680
Sa Wol.

636
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,050
Yes, Madam!

637
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,160
I have almost finished it.

638
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:58,130
Seeing that the swallow flies low,
it seems like there will be a shower.

639
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,270
Let's close them.

640
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,770
What?

641
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:05,700
The paste jars' covers.

642
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,710
I just... opened them.

643
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,710
Should I do it?

644
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:15,310
Madam! I will close all the covers.

645
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:19,320
- No. You have something else to do.
- Pardon?

646
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,590
Please make a trip to Heupgok.

647
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:24,000
The family of the Chief Scholar,
the Associate Right Minister,

648
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,790
has sent a marriage proposal to our Dam Ryeong.

649
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:30,030
That punk. No matter how long I
wait, there's no reply.

650
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:35,570
Go and hand him my letter
and personally get a reply.

651
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:44,580
Madam, I think she knows. That's why
she's doing it, to tear us apart.

652
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:49,880
If we are born again, let's meet as a couple.

653
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,320
And live happily together for 100 years.

654
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:58,220
I shouldn't have met a widower like this.

655
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:06,400
That's right. In the next life,
I will be sure to be born rich.

656
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,870
What do you want to be reborn as, Sa Wol?

657
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,700
Me?

658
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,610
I...

659
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,040
Sa Wol!

660
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,050
I want to be that b*tch's master.

661
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,950
The Legend of the Blue Sea

662
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,520
If you don't say anything by tomorrow,
then you must leave this place.

663
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,660
I said don't stay here like
a queen parasite and leave.

664
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,630
Did you really let her out in this cold weather?

665
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,430
You said you would not turn
your back on someone who has nothing.

666
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,740
What happened to you, Heo Joon Jae?

667
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,740
Next time at this time,
let's do it on the first day of snow.

668
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:52,680
Let's meet over there.
It's because I have something to tell you.

669
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,510
♬ So that I can feel your breath ♬
