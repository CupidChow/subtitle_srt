August, 1598, Heupgok-hyun, Gangwan-do

2
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,430
Hurry, hurry.

by The Blue Sea @ Viki

4
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm going!

5
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,570
Episode 1

6
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,730
- What fortune is all this?- I know, right?

7
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,700
Just pick them up quickly.

8
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,240
Wow, it's a full harvest! A year of abundance!

9
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,440
I've never seen something like this.

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,810
- Hurry and put them in the basket. - Yes, yes.

11
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,420
What is this?

12
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,030
Come quickly.

13
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,820
Is it a human or a fish?

14
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,540
Where's the mermaid?

15
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,640
This way.

16
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,390
It's a real mermaid.

17
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,690
Here, here, here...

18
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,500
- Be careful, Sir! - Ah, you started me!

19
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,910
- Why?  - They say that if someone
touches a mermaid without caution,

20
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,280
the mermaid will take the human's
soul and erase his memory.

21
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,150
What nonsense are you talking about?

22
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,720
I heard that is... a way the mermaids
defend themselves against humans.

23
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,790
I heard that there are some seamen
who went crazy from touching mermaids.

24
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,930
Well, that doesn't matter, since I won't
be using my hands on the mermaid but

25
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,640
using a sword.

26
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,040
Does it understand?

27
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,950
Anyway, I intend on giving
you people a big treat today.

28
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,720
Yes, yes.

29
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,250
Seong, is the feast preparation going well?

30
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,990
Yes.

31
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,430
When is the newly appointed town head arriving?

32
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,500
Sir, many town heads have come and gone,

33
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,080
but it's the first time seeing
someone with such great features.

34
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,180
- Is that so?  - Yes.

35
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,550
Ever since the time I studied
at Sungkyunkwan (Royal Academy),

36
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,050
I'm not sure about the academics,
but I never lost first place for visuals.

37
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,690
'Head and shoulders above others,'
or 'high and lofty,' shall I say.

38
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,830
It's a pity that such a great person
became a widower so early in life.

39
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,800
You really would be melting the
hearts of the ladies in the village.

40
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,170
That's right.

41
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,950
Sir, have you possibly heard about the mermaid?

42
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,580
- Mermaid?  - Yes.

43
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,890
The seamen say that, when mermaids
come to the land, they gain human legs.

44
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,990
There was a case that he married a human.

45
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,360
Those are all old stories, aren't they?

46
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,230
Although there are rumors about the existence
of mermaids, no one has directly seen one,

47
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,530
so how is it different from a ghost
story that causes delusions for people?

48
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,000
Is that so?

49
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,440
Today is a happy day when a new town head has come.

50
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,810
I am thinking of showing
everyone a very rare sight.

51
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,710
Sir, it's a real mermaid.

52
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,510
Not the kind of mermaid that
is told of in an old story,

53
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,720
but a real mermaid that I caught myself.

54
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,680
You...

55
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,950
What do you intend to do with that mermaid?

56
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:32,060
At the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, there is
supposed to be a never extinguished flame.

57
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,900
Do you know the secret to that? It's mermaid oil.

58
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,630
They say the oil extracted from a
mermaid is of incredible quality.

59
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,240
Even the whale oil, that is supposed to
be the best oil, does not compare to it.

60
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,610
It doesn't get stale even if
you leave it for a long time.

61
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,180
So this is just... the value can't be priced.

62
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,120
After doing my duties and living with goodwill,

63
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,350
I guess this kind of fortune comes.

64
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,990
To someone like you who does his
duties and lives with goodwill,

65
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,060
I'm very sorry to say this but...

66
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,660
What may you happen to be saying...?

67
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,700
I privately checked before
starting my post here.

68
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,310
- What do you mean?  - You...

69
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,850
You had prepaid over 1000 nyangs worth of the
ocean tax, and acquired a government position,

70
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,850
and collected over three times
that amount from the fishermen.

71
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:36,150
That is a really bad crime...
and the times are even worse.

72
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,420
Recently, His Majesty declared that
those who make profits from tax

73
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,100
and make the citizens suffer
should be punished severely.

74
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,930
Normally it would be
punished with just 100 hits...

75
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,540
Ah, but this time it seems to be the case of
taking one's life instead... What a pity.

76
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,810
Then, could you please tell me

77
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,510
what I have to do?

78
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,290
I mean, if there's something you wish for...

79
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,490
Anything.

80
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,590
Anything?

81
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,530
Anything that is.

82
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,770
Anything you say...

83
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,890
How dare he come to my land and cause me disgrace.

84
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,860
We'll see what happens.

85
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,770
A mermaid cannot survive leaving the sea.

86
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,440
I will definitely put that
mermaid in my hands again.

87
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,270
And that naive town head...

88
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,310
I'm going to get rid of him with my hands.

89
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,870
Look, look over there.
What is that wily thing doing?

90
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,570
Isn't she trying to drag that
town head guy into the ocean

91
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,010
and take his soul and erase his memory?

92
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:14,410
They say mermaids only erase
memories that they want to erase.

93
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:21,720
However, it would be useless to take that hand.

94
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,830
The worlds that humans and mermaids
live in are clearly different.

95
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,630
Whether it's a good or bad destiny,

96
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,970
what use is it to form ties with it?

97
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,930
The Legend of the Blue Sea

98
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,480
- It's time to get off.  - Mum, I'll press it.

99
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,880
- Ous Seo Yeon is going to press it?  - Yes.

100
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,490
Okay.

101
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm Kim Myung Hoon. A lawyer.

102
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,210
I'm Nam In Joong, who called earlier.

103
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,810
It's true that I won't get caught
buying stolen goods, right?

104
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,350
- Oh, what's this?- Oh, my!

105
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,270
Ta Da! It's a present.

106
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,210
Thank you, sir!

107
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,950
You know, you're like the Harry Potter of con-artists.

108
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,160
Oh no, you're better than Harry Potter.

109
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,030
Because your visuals are better.

110
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,760
Exactly.

111
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,840
It's the public prosecutors office.

112
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,370
Our elevators are broken so...

113
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,410
Ah yes, sorry for the inconvenience.

114
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,210
Yes, it's right in front,
so we'll be there right away.

115
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,680
Yes.

116
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,420
Okay, let's go. Hey, wake up.

117
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,060
- Let's go.- Hey, go!

118
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,510
- I guess you came quickly since you
said you were nearby.  - Ah, yes.

119
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,250
Work hard.

120
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,620
Just a moment.

121
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,060
Chief Go didn't come?
He was the one who always came.

122
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,670
Eye roll assessment: showing
the whites: 80%;low temperature;

123
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,760
high momentary concentration; wearing two layers of underwear;

124
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,400
habitual smoker, cigarettes in right pocket; fast heartbeat;

125
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,160
right handed: right pocket worn out;

126
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,340
hands folded, left on top; susceptibility to hypnosis: high;

127
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,270
same color scarf, undershirt,
and socks; matching compulsively.

128
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,310
Ah, Chief Go?   Conclusion: will conform to
repeated suggestions in hypnosis, using tools.

129
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,750
Yes.

130
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,260
- He came, right over there.  - Where..?

131
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,530
Over there.

132
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,040
Ah, I didn't recognize him because
he's wearing glasses today.

133
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,680
Yes, then please do your duties.

134
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,620
It's out of order.
I think you need to go by the stairs.

135
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,390
Elevator out of order. Work in progress.

136
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,820
Status of reservations for
the prosecutors' office today

137
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,540
Aigo, I'm telling you that
can't prove the identity!

138
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,310
Don't you know Judge Lee's style?

139
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,680
- Ah, Mr. Han Seong Tae. - Ah, yes.

140
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,750
I'll call you back. Oh, you came
together with Madam. Please have a seat.

141
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,490
- Would you like some tea?
- No, it's okay. - Have a seat.

142
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,360
You look even better now!
#730 prosecutors organization chart

143
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,130
Mr. Prosecutor, I had told you about him before...

144
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,800
This is CEO Han, who brought this work to us.

145
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,200
This is Myeong Dong Capital's madam.

146
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,700
Myeong Dong Capital?

147
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,840
I told you about it before.
You know, in Gangnam Jeil High School,

148
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,040
a student committed suicide, but his suicide
note had her son's name written on it.

149
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,450
He's the crazy idiot.

150
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,450
If he's going to fall, then he should fall by
himself and die. Why write my son's name on there?

151
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,770
Why does my son have to go through
this because a crazy idiot died?

152
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,940
My son will be taking
a college entrance exam soon.

153
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,940
Now is a crucial time to take
care of his mental health.

154
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,680
Come out within a minute.
The office owner will be coming back soon.

155
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,290
Should we go for some lunch? Ah, I'm hungry.

156
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,020
What do you like, madam?

157
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,630
What is this!

158
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,670
It's good. It's all good,
but I can't really do much for you.

159
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,340
Just get my son cleared.

160
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,240
Our secret account is near the Virgin Islands...

161
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,750
That's not that good.

162
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,420
- Excuse me? - Virgin Islands is not so good.

163
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,950
- What? - That is a tax haven.

164
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,490
When it's supposed to be a haven, how can
it be so famous? Can you even hide there?

165
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,030
That's true...

166
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,820
Why don't you move it and then hide?

167
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,120
I know a pretty cool place.

168
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,620
Where is it?

169
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,700
It's an island in the Mediterranean sea.
I heard the view is amazing there.

170
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,580
Oh yes, Madame! I've just checked the amount!

171
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,580
Of course! We're all on the same boat now.

172
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,930
If anyone gets a hold of that account,

173
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,050
then of course our dear prosecutor would have to step down,

174
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,860
but your company would be left in the dust
with tax audits. You are aware of that, right?

175
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,990
I'll be praying for nothing but successfor
your son's college entrance exams.

176
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,500
I'll be hanging up now. Alright.

177
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,700
Damn, it's so clean!

178
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,200
I had the best dreams
with this gig ahead of us.

179
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,540
Hey, Tae鈥?

180
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,910
Hey! You're not even going to say bye?!

181
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,290
- That little...- Leave him alone.

182
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,880
He doesn't know how to say bye but he can open doors in two seconds.

183
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,320
I hate it the most when he
just goes without saying bye!

184
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:19,290
What, and you do?You're the
one with the crappiest manners.

185
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,220
In the text that was compiled by royal
physicians during the Joseon Dynasty,

186
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,400
they called perspiration fluids of the heart.

187
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
Having a lot of perspiration on your hands signifies

188
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,670
your heart might have some problems.

189
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,870
Oh, my heart.

190
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,140
Herbalists can really tell
with just a glance, can't they?

191
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,880
Nothing but an occupational hazard. Darn, I
really wanted to just rest during my break.

192
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
But from humanistic aspects,
I couldn't let it go by unnoticed.

193
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,650
You must be a man with a lot of love.

194
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,390
We'll be landing shortly so I'll
go ahead and open your blinds.

195
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,390
Yes ma'am.

196
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,100
Isn't it beautiful?
I've been to a number of countries

197
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,200
but there isn't a place that
can match the ocean here.

198
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,370
You're right.

199
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,350
When I flew around here a long time ago,

200
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,980
I heard something from the elderly men
who've lived here for a long time.

201
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,250
They said that mermaids
still live in these waters.

202
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,380
Oh! Of course.

203
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,550
It's true!

204
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,040
A long time ago,
mermaids lived in any part of the ocean

205
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,170
but most of them have disappeared now,

206
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,480
and they say the last mermaids, who
remain on this Earth, live in this ocean.

207
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,200
Wow!

208
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,870
Mom! Look there!

209
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,840
It's a mermaid in the sea!

210
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,410
I read him a fairy tale once and
now he thinks mermaids are real.

211
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,620
Who is that!? What is it!?

212
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:18,170
What... What mess is this?

213
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,760
Now I gotta clean all this up...

214
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,960
What are you?

215
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,070
I'm asking who you think
you are that you're in here!

216
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,310
Are you Chinese? Japanese?

217
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:34,680
No you're not...You've got that Korean-feel.

218
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,490
- Damn. That...  - Damn. (whispered)
- The clothes I really treasure...

219
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,590
Why do you鈥?

220
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,890
The security in this hotel is a damn mess!

221
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,900
Hey! I said that's mine!

222
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,250
So you kick people when they're not looking?

223
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,380
Who do you think you are! Glaring like that!

224
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,690
What's that you have in your hands?

225
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,860
Hand it over. I said open your hands!

226
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,440
Hey! N-Neck, why'd my neck just turn like that?

227
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,780
I didn't get to stretch my body out because it's
still morning but I'm all stretched out now!

228
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,620
I am all stretched out but I don't really
want to fight first thing in the morning.

229
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,930
So if you just put down whatever
you have in that hand and leave,

230
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,400
then I'll pretend this never happened.

231
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,230
What is it? Is it a watch? A ring?

232
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,620
If you're delusional, then put a flower
on your head. You're confusing people.

233
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,000
Hello?

234
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,970
Please call the police;
somebody broke into my room.

235
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,140
Yes.

236
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,840
You're caught red-handed today!

237
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,340
This is to make sure you don't try
to squirm your way out of this.

238
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,950
Look here, look here! Good.

239
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,950
But what in the world did you steal?

240
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,880
Oh, geez! Seriously! A cherry!

241
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,150
Hey, did you just鈥?

242
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,190
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
I apologize.- It's okay, it's okay.

243
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,000
Damn, the security is shit.

244
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,200
Take her.

245
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,910
Come, let's go.

246
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:57,680
Excuse me. I'm just asking,
but do you need to cuff her?

247
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,320
Couldn't help it, there was a risk she might run.

248
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,850
Oh! Okay.

249
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,090
I'm just saying, she didn't steal anything.

250
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,630
Well that's because we caught
her before that happened.

251
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,630
You're lucky. Been a lot of
thefts in the area recently.

252
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,230
She's a prime suspect, very much so.

253
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,000
Prime suspect, my ass!

254
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,540
No matter how you look at her
she's obviously got a screw loose.

255
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,740
Come. Let's go.

256
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,880
Let's go.

257
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,590
Come. Let's go.

258
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,540
Let's see...

259
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,820
What is this?

260
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,730
I sent a picture so look into it.

261
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,700
It looks like a jadeite.

262
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,940
Yeah. Remember the 2013 Tiancheng
International Auction in Hong Kong?

263
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,580
It's similar to the one I saw
that time; this feels serious.

264
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,180
The owner of it?

265
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,950
She's something else too. She sure isn't normal.

266
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,660
Something weird is going on.

267
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,790
Hey! Hey you! Look at my hand!

268
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,430
Focus! I'm talking to you!

269
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,700
Why did you break into that hotel?!
Huh!? What were you trying to get!

270
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,240
You've been to other hotels, too, right?

271
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,370
What are you smiling at!?

272
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:41,740
You won't even answer my questions
but got the nerve to smile?

273
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,980
Do you think this is some kind of joke?!

274
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,390
Easy, easy!

275
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,700
- Easy!- Hurry up and get down!

276
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,940
That's right, that's right!

277
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,820
I'm a woman with a principle.

278
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,260
"Connections made on the plane end on the plane."

279
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,990
"No private meetings on land."

280
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,160
But you're making me break promises to myself.

281
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:42,270
I must have been quite taken with
you, Ms. Min Ji.

282
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,100
- But why are your hands so small?- My hands?

283
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,370
Look at this, your hands are so small!

284
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,980
- Oh, what's this?- How did you do that?

285
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,780
I wonder, how'd I do it?

286
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,650
Jackpot! This bracelet is at
the very least 400 years old.

287
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,190
It seems to be either
99% or 100% pure jadeite.

288
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,860
If it really is real then it's worth
more than 6 billion won (6 million USD)!

289
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,830
For now, let's check it in-person.

290
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,830
Who's the owner of the bracelet?
Are you with her right now?

291
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,940
This is so pretty. Are you giving it to me?

292
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,340
- No!- Excuse me?

293
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:26,010
Oh. I was just...showing it to you.
Wondering if it's pretty or whatever.

294
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,010
I'm relieved you said it's pretty.

295
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,220
It's for my mother. She likes white gold.

296
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,520
I think I have to go now.

297
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,990
- What did you just say?- Till the next time.

298
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,660
No...

299
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,230
That bracelet has something embedded in
writing. They are Chinese characters.

300
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,230
Dam Ryeong. I think it's someone's name.
- Dam Ryeong?

301
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,110
They say those who are bound to succeed end up throwing overhead kicks

302
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,840
even when they fall backwards.

303
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,610
You go on vacation and
get lucky on that lotto!

304
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,910
What should I do? Should I go to you?

305
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,700
Hey, what are you doing here?

306
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,240
I got nothing more to ask you.

307
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,110
She didn't steal anything. Please let her go.

308
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,240
You don't tell me what to do.

309
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,640
We conduct the investigation.

310
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,680
And you were the one that called to report a break-in.

311
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,280
Wedding band: new, newlywed;
empty gun holster, low wariness.

312
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,150
Conclusion: utilize bonding
over similarities to persuade.

313
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,090
She's not a stranger.

314
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,920
Then what was she doing there?

315
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,200
She's actually my wife.

316
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,800
- Your wife?- Yes!

317
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,270
We just got married. Look.

318
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,400
She's wearing a dress.

319
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,690
We need to be on our honeymoon but can't.

320
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,360
Because she's stuck here.

321
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,360
I am so sorry! I'll release her right away.

322
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,900
Perfect.

323
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,650
A gift.

324
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,580
Thank you so much.

325
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,920
Congratulations.

326
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,800
Hey! Stay there!

327
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,270
I'm sorry about this morning.

328
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,900
I was heartless. I apologize.

329
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,180
Right?

330
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,720
You don't have the heart to
shake my hand yet, right?

331
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,250
Well, let's just gradually do that.

332
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,060
But... that bracelet.

333
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,030
It's pretty!

334
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,670
It's... pretty.

335
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,780
Pretty...? Pretty...

336
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,850
Let's go. Because there are things I'm
sorry about, I'll buy you a present.

337
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,150
Let's go.

338
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,730
It's a red light! You should stop.

339
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,150
Seriously, what exactly are you?

340
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,640
Oh, it's over there.

341
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,340
Quickly come here.

342
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,290
Ah, really.

343
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,560
Hey.

344
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,320
Hold on. Wait here for a bit.

345
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,510
Try them on.

346
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,170
I said to put them on.

347
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,920
Hey, hey, hey.

348
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,930
That's right. You should wear these now.

349
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,940
Instead of walking around barefoot.

350
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,240
What is this? A woman's foot all chafed up.

351
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,300
Aish, really.

352
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,140
Ah, really. Go inside.

353
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,240
Dog Nam Doo

354
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,750
Ah, just wait a little. I'm with that girl now.

355
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:16,520
Excuse me. Do you know where she went?

356
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,690
She's in the fitting room, isn't she?

357
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,550
Gosh, 6 million. Where did you go?

358
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,360
Home For Missing Children

359
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,480
She's having fun.

360
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,490
Why are you, a grown person, in here...?

361
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,630
Hey, I told you to wait.

362
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,830
Do you not know what waiting means?

363
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,400
If you leave without a word,
I get really surprised.

364
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:46,000
Are you okay? You didn't get hurt anywhere?

365
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,810
Yeah, you didn't get hurt anywhere.

366
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,520
What's this? You know how to smile.

367
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:16,170
You're hungry, right? Let's go eat. You like to eat.

368
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:52,700
Are you from the jungle?

369
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:58,640
Are you a wolf maiden? Why are you so instinctive?

370
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,950
Okay, look.

371
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,220
Like this, okay?

372
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,090
Try it.

373
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,170
Yeah, yeah.

374
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,940
That's it! Good.

375
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:58,770
I think we've really gotten close now, right?

376
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:07,110
So what I'm saying is... Oh!
You got something stuck here.

377
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,420
Is that your first time seeing fire?
Why are you looking at it so surprised?

378
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,060
Do you like it?

379
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,250
Pretty.

380
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:50,560
Just keep eating what you've been eating.

381
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,720
I'm going somewhere so wait right here.

382
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,840
Texture, density, translucency, color...

383
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,250
everything is the way you said. I think it's genuine.

384
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,680
So let's meet each other right now! Should
I go there or do you want to come here?

385
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,490
I've already secured a
swag dealer and a buyer.

386
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,960
I told you I need to go somewhere.

387
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,660
Where are you going,
carrying something so precious?

388
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:38,430
There's a place. The world's end.

389
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,670
The world's end, my butt!
Do you want to end with me first?

390
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,300
- Hey, don't be like that
and...- Just wait a week.

391
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:33,050
Dear customers, we informed you that our
business closes its doors at 9:00 p.m.

392
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,750
We thank you for your visit and your trust.

393
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:40,190
Tomorrow we will open again at 8:00 in
the morning to offer you our best quality.

394
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,890
Thank you.

395
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,180
Would you please leave? Business hours are over.

396
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,080
It's closed, closed. (In Spanish)

397
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,180
Do you speak English?

398
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:11,020
Hello. Do you understand that?

399
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,750
She is crazy.

400
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,820
Because of her we are getting off work late.

401
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,060
鈾?Always in the same dream 鈾?

402
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,200
鈾?An unfamiliar face and 鈾?

403
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,600
鈾? In a time which is suspended 鈾?

404
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,070
鈾?You and I met by chance 鈾?

405
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:36,040
鈾?I guess I was a little terrified 鈾?

406
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,750
鈾?I was afraid it would be a dream forever 鈾?

407
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:43,750
鈾?Now, even when I open my eyes 鈾?

408
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:48,020
It's you.

409
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,790
鈾?This is love story  鈾?

410
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:55,730
鈾?I cannot hide 鈾?

411
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,230
鈾?My two eyes which only see you 鈾?

412
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:03,170
鈾?I cannot close them 鈾?

413
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,770
鈾?This is amazing 鈾?

414
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:11,380
鈾?Even if everything in the world 鈾?

415
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:15,180
鈾?Were given to me 鈾?

416
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,990
鈾?I cannot exchange it with you, my love. 鈾?

417
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,660
鈾?Although it may hurt me a lot 鈾?

418
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:28,330
鈾?Even if I ask myself again 鈾?

419
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:32,330
鈾?This is really love, you know 鈾?

420
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,700
鈾?This is love story  鈾?

421
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,540
鈾?This is happiness 鈾?

422
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:45,110
鈾?I'm afraid it might be a dream 鈾?

423
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,850
鈾?I can't open my eyes 鈾?

424
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:51,650
鈾?This is my love story  鈾?

425
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,690
鈾?I love you, only you 鈾?

426
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,740
That's pretty.

427
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,840
That's mine. Give it back.

428
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,780
Wait.

429
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:26,720
- "Wait" is a word that means something good
is going to happen soon.- There you are!

430
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,790
A word that even when, like a wave, I go somewhere
far away for a bit, my friend will find me.

431
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:36,860
A word that even when there's
something scary like a shark around,

432
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,930
you don't have to be scared or
look around (for something).

433
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,040
No, but why are you, a grown person, in here?

434
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,140
Hey, I told you to wait.

435
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,540
Don't you understand the word wait?

436
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,010
If you leave without a word,
I get really surprised.

437
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:58,580
Are you okay? You didn't get hurt anywhere?

438
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,650
Yeah, you didn't get hurt anywhere.

439
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:06,290
A word that means my friend is
wishing for me not to get hurt.

440
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,700
A word that warms the heart.

441
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,070
A word that means something
good is going to happen.

442
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:37,590
The Legend of the Blue Sea

443
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,200
Hey! Turn on the light!

444
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,560
I'm not even surprised anymore. It's not
like there are only one or two weird things.

445
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,100
Aigoo.

446
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,570
What is love?

447
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,900
That's surrendering.

448
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,370
Meaning you're in big trouble.
