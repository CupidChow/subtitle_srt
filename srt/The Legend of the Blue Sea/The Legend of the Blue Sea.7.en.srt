00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,350
Episode 7

2
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,440
His pulse is weak.

3
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,710
His tendons, bones, and flesh are damaged, and
in that area, blood clots have been formed.

4
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,950
If it gets into his heart—

5
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,320
If that's the case, what happens?

6
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,190
He won't be able to overcome the coming crisis.

7
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:55,530
I believe he was beat up by a group
of people after he fell off the cliff.

8
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,430
It seems like my friend secretly hid my lover

9
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,340
and fell upon this calamity
while coming back down.

10
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,490
My Lord, about my concubine making a ruckus
in your office the day before yesterday.

11
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,390
Please forgive her.

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,520
She was afraid that the evil omen

13
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,530
that brings death might have
entered the government office.

14
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,070
It seems like she was out of
her mind worrying about that.

15
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,310
So, I reprimanded her to the point of tears.

16
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,840
I see.

17
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,280
Yes.

18
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,180
A few days ago, ever since that
corpse was found at the beach,

19
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,080
the sentiment of the village
people has become panic-stricken.

20
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,620
So you must have also been disheartened.
I am very sorry, Sir.

21
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,290
I see that you have some rare and precious fruit.

22
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,130
Ah, yes. It is a tangerine.

23
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,670
Although I am of a lowly position,
I have a taste for good food.

24
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,570
So I got it through a boat coming
from Tamra Island after much difficulty.

25
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,910
Is that so?

26
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,310
This inn is probably the only place able to eat
this kind of fruit in this village, right?

27
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,420
Of course. The price is exorbitant.

28
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,690
But this tangerine was found while examining

29
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,220
the corpse found at the beach.

30
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,370
On the day that he died,
the last person he met was you.

31
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,210
You met him that night and offered
him a drink, along with this fruit.

32
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,610
He died from drinking the alcohol spiked
with poison, and you threw him on the beach.

33
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,550
However, the traces of poison were not
found during the initial examination.

34
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,890
On the first day that snow fell and water froze,
the corpse was frozen like ice, but then

35
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,230
it was different during the
second examination of the corpse.

36
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,470
As the frozen corpse thawed, fatal poison
extracted from blowfish eggs was found.

37
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,910
My Lord, I am ignorant and
cannot understand what you—

38
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,310
- Look here! - Yes, Sir!

39
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,190
We have found the blowfish-egg
poison in Yang Seung Gil's stable.

40
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,260
My Lord, it's unfair.

41
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,100
Your servant does not know anything.
I've been set-up.

42
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,200
My Lord!

43
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,440
Let go! Won't you let go?

44
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,350
Come!

45
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,950
What do you think you are doing?!

46
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,420
Please, cooperate with us.

47
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,360
If Se Hwa is alive, then I will spare your life.

48
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,070
Who is that? I don't know.

49
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,040
If you don't know, then you will die.

50
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,210
Even if I can't find Se Hwa,

51
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,150
you will die in this place.

52
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:27,600
Look here! The town head is bewitched by that
wily thing and is trying to destroy the village.

53
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,810
He is trying to save that mermaid who brought
rainstorms and caused people to die!

54
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,140
Try stepping out just one step.

55
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,250
Do you think all these eyes
and mouths will stay still?

56
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,940
Oh, no, you can't!

57
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,710
My pearls!

58
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm sorry, I came too late.

59
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,740
Se Hwa, you liked listening to my
dreams, didn't you?

60
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,670
Are you listening?

61
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,080
In my dream, we were born again.

62
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,220
We met again and were together.

63
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,060
You came from a far away ocean to meet me.

64
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,600
And though I could not remember you,

65
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,430
you were already in my heart.

66
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,040
♬  She became a mermaid ♬

67
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,250
Se Hwa.

68
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,750
Wouldn't you like to listen to more of this story?

69
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,660
♬ A sad story ♬

70
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,200
Legend of the Blue Sea

71
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,700
I need to confirm something.

72
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,340
Yeah.

73
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,710
You... Can you try saying these words?

74
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,780
What words?

75
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,630
I love you.

76
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,680
Then are you mine?

77
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,180
Are you surrendering? Did you lose?

78
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,620
What?

79
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,550
I was going to be the first to
surrender when the first snow falls.

80
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,390
I really did not know you would
surrender first. Are you mine?

81
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,360
No matter what I say, would you believe me?

82
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,570
What are you talking about?

83
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,970
You said you love me. That's what it means, right?

84
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,710
Let's say you love someone.

85
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,040
- That means that you surrender.
- What is "surrender"?

86
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,210
It means, losing. You lost.
In other words, if you love someone,

87
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,520
no matter what that person says,
you will believe everything.

88
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,490
- That means you are in trouble. - Why?

89
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,160
That means that you belong to that guy.
If he says to do this, you do this.

90
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,360
If he says to do that, you will do that.
If he tells you to believe lies, then you believe lies.

91
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,330
That's love.

92
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,700
So is it okay to say that to a guy or not?

93
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,800
It's okay.

94
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,140
No! You shouldn't.

95
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,840
If you say things like "I love you" to
me, that means you are mine.

96
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,340
If you say things like that to me, I'll probably
use you to do things and lie like crazy.

97
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,180
I'll take all your possessions.

98
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,020
That is supposed to be love. Isn't that it?

99
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,020
Ah, geez! Who would utter such nonsense?!

100
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,030
♬  Even at this moment. ♬

101
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,060
There's someone. Someone good.

102
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,200
Who is it? A guy?

103
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,400
Yes, it's a guy.

104
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,510
So, it's a guy. He is a nut job!

105
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,740
What's a nut job?

106
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,910
He is a crazy jerk.

107
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,950
Seeing how he says things like that,
he is a total sleazeball and a womanizer.

108
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,850
Those are all bad words, right?

109
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,190
Right. You should not hang
out with that kind of punk.

110
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,890
Was he really good to you? Huh?

111
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,500
When it was raining, he put an umbrella over
me, and he held my hand when I was alone.

112
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,000
Ah, hand...

113
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,770
I'm sure he will do anything... to seduce a girl.

114
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,910
He made me ramen.

115
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,340
Ra... ramen! Wow, ramen!

116
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,950
Did he tell you he'll go into your
house and eat some ramen before leaving?

117
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,680
Wow, what a dark-hearted jerk!

118
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,280
He is not a dark-hearted jerk.

119
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,220
He is a good person.

120
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:27,230
If he was such a good person,
you should be next to him, not by me.

121
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:33,930
And let me make it clear, in case you
misunderstand... When I said earlier...

122
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,570
"I love you," was not because I really loved you,

123
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,010
but I was telling you to say that
so that I can confirm something—

124
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,340
I love you.

125
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,590
- Should I say it again? - No, that's fine.

126
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,330
I can say it again.

127
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,500
No, don't. It's fine.

128
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,160
Don't say it.

129
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,480
- Where are you coming from? - From a ski resort.

130
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,880
Did you have a date?

131
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,610
Date, my butt!

132
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,320
She was begging about snow,
so I just took her there briefly.

133
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,990
That's a date. Isn't that right, Tae Oh?

134
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,400
This dude keeps glaring at a
person all the time nowadays.

135
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,600
- Do you want some? - No, thanks.
You can eat all the tangerines you like.

136
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,670
Do you want some?

137
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,740
Did you and he have a fight?

138
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,170
No, we didn't.

139
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,610
Then why is he in such a bad mood?

140
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,170
Yo, upper room!

141
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,110
Hey!

142
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,880
What is it?

143
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,830
Since I can't fall asleep, I keep thinking these
useless thoughts. Are you still meeting him?

144
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,700
- Who? - Who else?! Earlier...

145
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,670
Ramen! Are you still seeing him?

146
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,410
Yes, I am.

147
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,280
You are?

148
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,720
I see. You are seeing him.

149
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,990
Well, how does he look?

150
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,230
He is pretty.

151
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,570
His eyes are sparkling.

152
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,410
He must look like a girly boy.

153
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,080
You should be most careful with guys who look
like that! What good is a guy who looks pretty?

154
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,050
Those guys are lustful inside!

155
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,920
You... So did you tell him that, too?

156
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,890
What?

157
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:48,690
You know. Those words you said
earlier at the ski resort.

158
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,660
I love you?

159
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,970
Yes. That. Did you tell that jerk that, too?

160
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,610
I love you.

161
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,510
Yes, I did.

162
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,220
Why?

163
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,460
To you, those words must be so easy.

164
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,890
- Saying those words to just anyone.
- I don't say it just to anyone.

165
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,930
What did you do well that
you are raising your voice?

166
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,270
You get up! Who told you to come down, eh?

167
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,230
Go back up.

168
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,210
But, well, maybe it's a good thing.

169
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:45,280
Honestly, I felt a bit burdened, worrying
that you had a special feeling towards me.

170
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,150
Good luck with him.

171
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,060
I will. I came to work things out with him.

172
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,890
Good, then!

173
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,360
Must be nice! Good luck! Hurry and get back up!

174
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,620
She came to work things out with him?
Then, why is she here?

175
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:22,720
Haha, isn't she a funny girl?! Ah, annoying.

176
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,020
So annoying.

177
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,810
Se Hwa!

178
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,880
Se Hwa! Se Hwa!

179
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,500
What was that?

180
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,240
What kind of dream was that?

181
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,610
This ajussi is our Joon Jae's friend.

182
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
Dept. Head Ajussi Nam

183
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,200
010-0960-1303

184
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,520
He cannot answer the phone.
You will be connected to voice mail.

185
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,440
Hello?

186
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,980
Oh, what's up?

187
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,850
Dept. Head Nam? He hasn't come to work yet.

188
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,880
What? How?

189
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,760
Is he that kind of person? So where is he now?

190
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,460
Okay, let's hang up for now.

191
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,990
What happened, Father?

192
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,900
Dept. Head Nam drove while drunk
last night and got into an accident.

193
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,430
Ajussi doesn't like drinking, though.

194
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:53,140
How would you know? How can you tell
a person by looking at his appearance?

195
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,210
So, how badly is he hurt?

196
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,240
Should we go visit him at the hospital?

197
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,910
He is unconscious. It seems serious.

198
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,320
Really?

199
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,450
Oh no. What do we do?

200
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,060
When you go to the hospital, let me go with you.

201
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,660
Okay, let's do that.

202
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,390
2) 8/21/2016 Incheon International Airport

203
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,440
Disguised as a parking valet,
he stole a luxury car and ran away

204
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,140
It's been three months. During the
three months, that punk Ma Dae Young,

205
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,800
without having confirmed
any additional criminal activities,

206
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,280
his whereabouts are still in the dark.

207
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,110
You said that there is a possibility that the
Hoehyeon-dong loan shark murderer could be him.

208
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,750
There is.

209
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,820
No, it is highly possible. But we only
have a suspicion. We don't have evidence.

210
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,690
There was no money or belongings
that were lost. So, in that precinct,

211
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,720
they see these debtors that
disappeared overseas as suspects,

212
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,160
and they told me not me to butt in.

213
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,190
He was a loan shark and a person who
had a lot of people holding a grudge against him,

214
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,000
so that's possible.

215
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,070
If it was due to a grudge, they would have planned
it well. But look at the time and location.

216
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,470
It was in broad daylight
at three in the afternoon.

217
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,980
Anyone would be able to
witness this while passing by.

218
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,180
But then, this was done very
suddenly and impulsively.

219
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,950
Ma Dae Young has an anger disorder.

220
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,290
With just that, nowadays, there aren't just one
or two people who can't control their anger.

221
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,960
It was really meticulous. It's really clean
without any fingerprints or traces of DNA.

222
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,830
This was done by someone who
is always prepared to murder.

223
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,060
But it seems our superiors
don't want us to focus on that.

224
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,840
If an escaped criminal committed that kind
of crime? Then we would be cursed at more.

225
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,070
Hey! Do you think that's important?

226
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,110
Then what is so important to you?

227
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,780
You, punk, go catch that dude who
feigned false identity in Yeoyido.

228
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,280
The one who erased all the CCTVs and took off.

229
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,350
I have a feeling I know who that is. I will catch
that slimeball after catching Ma Dae Young.

230
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,290
You are so dead, you punk!

231
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,460
Hey! Hey! Hey!

232
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,290
The female employees at the
aquarium thought Yeongdeung Police

233
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,460
had such a handsome detective

234
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,330
and were about to start a fan club. Then they
saw your profile and they were so disappointed!

235
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,370
Why are they disappointed?
He and I look pretty similar!

236
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,350
According to Ahn Jin Joo's SNS,

237
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,040
she will be attending a seminar
for International Middle School Preparation.

238
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,580
Communicating to SNS followers.
VIP invitation

239
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,720
to International Middle School - Zeal for
Education. This is Helicopter Mom's way.

240
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,390
She's leaving at three. She's probably
going out of the house at 2 to 2:30.

241
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,160
The family's chauffeur has the day off. Ahn
Jin Joo's driving skill is a bit lacking.

242
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,500
At that moment, Tae Oh will call using the
English Academy's number and distract her.

243
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,040
Yes, I am Elizabeth's mom. Really?

244
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,380
Our Elizabeth, oh my! Was first in
English oral competition? Oh my God!

245
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,180
Are you not hurt anywhere?

246
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,150
I don't think so. Yes. Omo.

247
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,190
Please just call this number.
Since I am busy, I will be going then.

248
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,030
Oh my!

249
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:06,470
After you make your face seen, your
second meeting would be at the seminar.

250
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,100
- Okay. - What are you doing?

251
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,740
Good morning.

252
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,210
- Let's go. - Where are you going?

253
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,210
Where would we be going? To work.

254
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,340
We're going to work.

255
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,350
Going to work. What work are you going to do?

256
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,050
Ah, that is... The work that we are doing is...

257
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:32,460
To say it simply,
it's like getting a person's heart?

258
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,860
To let a person realize his or her own fault.

259
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,150
Although there definitely is a problem with
the way they accumulated their wealth,

260
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,300
and yet they are beyond
the perimeters of the law.

261
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,430
To those people who fall into that blind spot,

262
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,500
we take appropriate actions.

263
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,840
We also redistribute the wealth.

264
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,380
For the country's sake.

265
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,240
A civil servant?

266
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,880
I saw it on TV. The ones who work
for the country are civil servants.

267
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,100
We are not.

268
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,760
Just because they work at a
public office doesn't mean

269
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,490
they are doing it for the country's benefit.

270
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,560
So, Heo Joon Jae does a cooler
job than a civil servant.

271
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,800
Well...

272
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,440
Heo Joon Jae, I knew it.

273
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,960
Why am I making excuses to her?

274
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,000
I know, right? You were really
shabby, listening right here.

275
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,600
Then, should I say it? That we're conmen?

276
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,000
I don't feel good about that word.

277
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,410
Hey, should we make a new name? A cool one?

278
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,280
- What are you saying?
- Okay, okay. We're late. Let's go.

279
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,960
What is this?

280
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,470
Here.

281
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,450
Check this house.

282
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,420
Hey, hey.

283
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,230
Ma Dae Young! You bastard!

284
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,110
Ma Dae Young, bastard!

285
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,550
Ma Dae Young!

286
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,530
Why are you doing this?

287
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,470
Wow! Score!

288
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,510
So cold.

289
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,850
I am hungry. Should we go to
the convenience store to eat?

290
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,050
Okay.

291
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,290
Hey! Seo Yoon Ah,
you live in rental apartments, right?

292
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,060
- So? - My mom said

293
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,340
as the rental kids started coming to our
school, our neighborhood's quality went down!

294
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,680
Your mom is a divorcee, right?

295
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,250
My mom said so.

296
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,050
Kids like you have such
a messy family education.

297
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,390
So, she told me not to play with you.

298
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,460
I also don't want to play with you.
Can you please move?

299
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,200
This is not a place for people who live in
the rental apartments to pass, you know.

300
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,400
Can you turn around and pass there?

301
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,210
You!

302
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:51,480
Hey! You pushed me! You? To me?

303
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,390
What are you doing? Put me down, please.

304
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,130
You should not bother your friends.

305
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,470
Let me down, please.

306
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,740
Hurry and promise me,
that you won't bother your friend.

307
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,620
- Mommy. - Oh my. What's wrong?

308
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,760
Elizabeth, what's wrong?

309
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,960
Hurry and come.

310
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,270
Yes. The car is still here.

311
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,410
Thank you for earlier, Unni.

312
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,650
But what is divorce?

313
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,950
Divorce is when people who got married break up.

314
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,250
Why would they break up?

315
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,690
You also don't know that, Unni? They break up
because they don't love each other anymore.

316
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,530
They don't love each other
so why did they get married?

317
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:15,030
They were in love when they got married,
but then they changed. That's why.

318
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:20,440
My mom and dad probably loved
each other when I was a baby.

319
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,380
It's just that they changed.

320
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,510
Why would they change?

321
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,340
What do you mean "why?"

322
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,150
It's just that they all change.

323
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,400
Even those who are not divorced
are staying together not necessarily

324
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,720
because they love each other.

325
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,090
They are living while enduring it.

326
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,890
Really?

327
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,830
Unni, do you know why I'm working
hard going to the academy?

328
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,100
No.

329
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,640
My mom... might love me now,

330
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,710
but if I don't study hard

331
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,210
I'm afraid she might not love me anymore.

332
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,440
I'm afraid she might send me away.

333
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,320
That's why I work hard and go to the
academy even though I don't want to go.

334
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Let's go.

335
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,910
That hair, it may appear
messy as if it wasn't prepped.

336
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,580
It's so calculatedly elegant. Where is it?

337
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,150
Where is it?

338
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,220
At which shop did she get it done?

339
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,920
Mom! I told you it's that Unni.

340
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,660
Is it you?

341
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,730
Are you the one who told my daughter off?

342
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,500
How could it be? The outfit does not match at all.

343
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,600
It may look like the soup
and rice being served separately,

344
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,740
and yet they match so marvelously well.

345
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,310
What is this weird feeling?

346
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,410
Who coordinated that?

347
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,080
It's because she bothered her.

348
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,110
So funny. Who are you?

349
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,510
Are you her mother? Are you the school teacher?

350
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,920
These days, even school teachers can't just...

351
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,950
When did Chanel and Dior collaborate?

352
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,230
Oh my! Why didn't I know that?

353
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,890
Mom.

354
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,530
I am Seo Yoon Ah's friend.

355
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,130
In the future, I won't let you
go if you bother my friend.

356
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,369
You promised.

357
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,550
Wait.

358
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,850
I... have a lot I am curious about,
but let me just ask you one thing.

359
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,930
Which dermatologist do you go to?

360
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,430
"I don't go," "I was born with this skin," "I
don't even take care of it and it's like this."

361
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,030
Don't even think of saying those nonsense lies.

362
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,470
Answer me. Where do you get taken care of?

363
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,220
It's not in Seoul. It's very far.

364
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,720
I knew it. So, she goes out on an expedition. Oh, my!

365
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,030
Which country—

366
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,600
Oh, my world. Which country could she get—

367
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,270
What is it? It's past 3.

368
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,240
I know. It's strange.

369
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,740
The car is still there.

370
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,510
She must have gone out and just came back.

371
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,180
Wait.

372
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,950
I'm going to rest today. Culture shock!
When did Chanel and Dior collaborate?

373
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,830
I'd appreciate information exchanged.
This is FaPe's way.

374
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,830
This is FaPe's way.

375
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,560
Fashion people?

376
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,030
Seriously. Today was such a waste.

377
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,600
I'm really not feeling this.
Can't you look into something else?

378
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,910
You're at it again.

379
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,440
Hey! I will be stopping by somewhere.

380
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,980
You guys go on first.

381
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,550
- Where are you going? - You don't need to know, punk.

382
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,920
You don't even have anywhere else to go...

383
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,070
Could it be? It's probably not him.

384
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,980
My Joon Jae.

385
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,750
But why are you doing this?

386
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,320
This is the only thing I am good at.

387
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,050
You could just use that talent
somewhere else. You are very talented.

388
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,990
Like you are one to talk!

389
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,530
- Then what about you? - It's Hyung.

390
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,060
Hyung, what happened for you
to start this line of work?

391
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,940
So people need to meet the right people.

392
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,240
Winter 2006

393
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,550
Searching for Mom.
We got separated when I was ten.

394
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,530
Her name is Mo Yoo Ran. Her birthday is...

395
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,980
We could have met at the office
if the interior renovation was finished.

396
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,740
(Sorry) to be meeting here...

397
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,350
Can you really find my mom?

398
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,380
- Your mother's hometown was
Cheongbuk, Jaecheon, right? - Yes.

399
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,420
She's the only daughter of
a really rich household.

400
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,260
But after her parents passed away, she made the
mistake of cosigning a loan that went wrong.

401
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,290
She lost all her inheritance. After that,
none of the relatives contacted her.

402
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,130
Yes, how did you know?

403
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,500
How would I? It's my work.

404
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,370
Can you please find my mom?

405
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,210
But then,

406
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,980
because she hasn't reported her moving,

407
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,310
she doesn't have a permanent residence,
and she doesn't seem like she's remarried.

408
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,780
It is very hard to find her the usual way.

409
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:45,090
In the end, you will have to get an expert.
But then the fee would be...

410
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,860
Ah, the fee.

411
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,800
Wait.

412
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,610
Would this much be okay?

413
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,580
Of course, that man just ran off with that money.

414
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,470
You should not worry about that part.

415
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,700
I will find him for sure.

416
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,110
I will be calling you after a week. Bye

417
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,410
Yes.

418
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,110
You conman!

419
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,410
Ahjumma, he is a conman! Don't give him money!

420
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,320
No.

421
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,990
- Give me back my money!
- Let go! Let go! - My money! My money!

422
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,400
How many days were you there?

423
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,960
Half a month.

424
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,270
Hey.

425
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,870
Don't you want to work with me?
I like people who are tenacious.

426
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,380
If you go around finding your mother
like that, only your legs would hurt.

427
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,720
You need to have money to find your mom.
To put it bluntly,

428
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,150
you found your mom but then what
would you do since you have no money?

429
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,290
When would you earn enough money
ripping off a young kid like me?

430
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:27,190
- What? - You should rip off
people who have a lot of money.

431
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,500
If you are going to deceive someone anyway,
you need to invest in time and finance.

432
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,900
If you consider the financial efficiency,

433
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,070
wouldn't it be more profitable to steal
from rich people, using the same effort?

434
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,070
There are so many bigwigs who can't
report it even when they are ripped off.

435
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,320
Just until I find my mom. Just until I
get enough money to buy a house for her.

436
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,490
You already gathered enough to buy her a house.

437
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,330
I did. It's just that I haven't found my mom.

438
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,140
Dog Nam Doo also worked hard to find my mom.

439
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,570
But he couldn't find where she is.

440
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,820
Please look at this, Hyung.

441
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,730
What is it?

442
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,600
If it's the same person's x-rays.

443
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,860
The other hospital said it was
switched with another patient.

444
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,530
This is the same person.

445
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,570
Really?

446
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,370
You can just look at the bones
and the fracture. Look here.

447
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:50,380
The widths of tibia and fibula and the
way they are stretched out are the same.

448
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,350
This one has a fracture and this
one is in the healing stage .

449
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,920
- Oh? - Why?

450
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,490
The bone has stuck together
but there is still edema.

451
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,460
Usually, the swelling disappears

452
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,790
and then the bone sticks together
but then for this person the bones fuse first.

453
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,330
Can this happen?

454
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:15,570
Hyung, what's that... How long does it usually take
for the fractured bones to fuse together again?

455
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,840
It's a case-by-case basis, but still,

456
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,710
for the fractured bone to fuse
together completely, about 12-16 weeks.

457
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:26,450
Hey, even with a hairline fracture,
it's maximum 3-4 week with a cast.

458
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,020
What if, in just one week, this became this?

459
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,620
Does that make sense?

460
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,620
Right. It doesn't make sense.

461
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,390
Hurry and go. I am busy.

462
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,530
What is that? So scary.
What if she's really a zombie.

463
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,100
Hey, as if.

464
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,670
I think that woman...
Beyond just losing her memories

465
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,870
or lacking a bit, disregarding
those, there's something.

466
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:59,750
I know. I also think so.
But I can't get a grasp of what that is.

467
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:08,020
Hello? Did you find the wooden
inscription panels? Really?

468
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,760
Who is the owner?

469
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,790
Kim Dam Ryeong?

470
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,860
Even the name is cool. Okay, I'll be right back.

471
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,310
Oppa, I need to get back now.

472
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,840
It looks like we found the owner of relics
we excavated from a wrecked ship.

473
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,770
Wait. Wait. The name of the owner is Dam Ryeong?

474
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,150
Yes. He was a town head of Heupgok
Hyun in Gangwon Province. Why?

475
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,950
Oh, it's nothing. Go in.

476
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,180
See you later.

477
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:43,120
Make sure Joon Jae and that girl aren't doing
anything at home. Keep an eye on them, okay?

478
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,360
Dam Ryeong.

479
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,160
Dam Ryeong, Dam Ryeong.

480
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,660
Why are you doing this?

481
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,260
What do you mean, why? That's what I want to
ask you. Are you going to jump from here?

482
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,730
No, that's not it.

483
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,700
Don't try to fool me. You even took off your shoes.
Stand up. I've seen many people like this...

484
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,110
Sit here.

485
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,480
Would you like some barley tea?

486
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,160
It's hot.

487
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,230
No, wait.

488
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,940
Let's just talk.

489
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:42,670
I've lived here for a long time, so I barely
remember how to speak the language from there.

490
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,180
This language is more comfortable.

491
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,980
I got it.

492
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,850
Wow. Who would've known

493
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,250
that I would meet a mermaid
in the middle of Seoul?

494
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:00,830
I also thought I was the only mermaid
in Seoul. I was really surprised.

495
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,300
No, but what were you doing there earlier?

496
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,170
I was hungry. I don't have money,

497
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,840
and it's time for a meal, so I went there to eat.

498
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,040
You don't have money?

499
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,370
Hey, I guess you don't know anything yet.

500
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,040
Like what?

501
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,880
You really didn't know about this?

502
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,920
These are our tears. What are you doing?

503
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,850
These count as money here.

504
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,660
This is money? Why?

505
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,190
If you don't know, just memorize it.
These count as money here.

506
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,100
And when you start to tear up,

507
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,040
just do this and collect all of them.

508
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,070
This helped me so much in my life.

509
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,470
Ah, I cried a couple of times.
I should've collected them.

510
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,710
The bigger they are, the more valuable.
So instead of uselessly crying small tears,

511
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,650
hold it in, and cry thick tears. Thick. Sobbing.

512
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:04,620
Small tears are about $20-$30
each, and thick ones are $40-$50.

513
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,290
The most valuable are the pearls
that have a pale pink sheen to them.

514
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,460
The pink-tinted pearls? The ones that
come out when you cry from happiness?

515
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,300
That's right.

516
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,570
But as you live here, very happy moments

517
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,040
that make you tear up don't come often.
I cried that kind of tear just once.

518
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,510
Then I should cry a lot and give
all my tears to Heo Joon Jae.

519
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,720
Who is Heo Joon Jae?

520
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:38,020
He's a good person. He works harder than a civil
servant for the country's sake.   Art of Fraud:

521
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,690
He's a cool person whom I like.
Committing Fraud through Neuroscience

522
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,430
Wait. So you didn't come up
for a short visit to sightsee?

523
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,300
But you came up here because of a guy you liked?

524
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,940
Hey, you really don't know anything!

525
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,840
- How long has it been since you got here?  - One month.

526
00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:00,010
The guy you like, is it one way or both ways?

527
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,680
I mean, do you like him by yourself or is it mutual?

528
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,620
It's just me right now.

529
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:09,250
You're really hopeless! You should have
thought it through before coming up.

530
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,620
How can you act so haphazardly—

531
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,830
Ah, this is why, while living here,
I talk so much to the fish that pass by.

532
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,120
I told them to let the mermaids know,

533
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,930
"Don't ever come to Seoul because of love.
" You never heard that?

534
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,170
No, I haven't heard.

535
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,770
Ah, these kids...

536
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,140
Are they getting caught or forgetting
while on their way? These fish heads...

537
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,840
Why can't I? Why can't I come
up to the land because of love?

538
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,980
Listen carefully.

539
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,320
You have a time limit.

540
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,560
The moment that a mermaid leaves the water
for land, her heart starts to harden.

541
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,330
Even if your legs don't, you heart has a time limit.

542
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:59,770
There is only one way you
can continue to breathe

543
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,970
and keep your heart beating on land.

544
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:05,340
It is only possible when the
person you love loves you back.

545
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:11,950
There is no other way your heart
can continue to beat passionately.

546
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:18,360
If not, it isn't too late,
so return to the ocean, idiot.

547
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,260
So why did you come here without measures?

548
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,270
But still, for you to surface and

549
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,840
to make a decision for you to walk,
there must have been some kind of catalyst.

550
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,610
That guy must have said something to you.

551
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,910
He told me to come to Seoul.

552
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:42,610
Of course. What did he want to do once you
came? Did he ask you to date? To marry?

553
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,950
To go to famous eateries...

554
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,720
That's it?

555
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,690
He also told me to come see the fireworks.

556
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,290
Fireworks?

557
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,860
You are really an easy girl.

558
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,770
Can you decide so easily on love with
specialty restaurants and fireworks?

559
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,740
Was there any progress during your month here?

560
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,540
Yeah. Just one look at you.

561
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,340
I can tell you're someone who
will continue to make no progress.

562
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,680
Should I help you?

563
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,180
How?

564
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,350
All human males are the
incarnation of jealousy.

565
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,290
Jealousy?

566
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,560
If you don't know, memorize.
Jealousy is the fastest path to love.

567
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,830
♬  No, no, no, no, no ♬

568
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,370
I think it would be good if
we started with a makeover.

569
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,640
Should we try to get some money for shopping?

570
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,280
Hold it. Hold it in,

571
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,680
and then cry thick. Thick tears.

572
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,380
You...

573
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,050
Hello. I've heard a lot about you.

574
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,750
Who... are you?

575
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,650
I'm Yoo Jeong Hoon.

576
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,350
Please take care of me in the future.

577
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,490
Take care of what?

578
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,390
- My darling is... - Excuse me?

579
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:31,520
I heard she was living in this house for a bit.

580
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,890
I heard it was a house full of
men, so I was a bit concerned.

581
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:38,500
But now that I see you, I'm assured.

582
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:43,940
You're assured? I don't think
I have assuring type of face.

583
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,740
I'll see you tomorrow.

584
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:52,810
Dear, how about you tie your hair tomorrow?
Your neckline is pretty.

585
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,050
Like this?

586
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,460
Hey. Go in now.

587
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,890
- Go on in.  - Go on in.

588
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,660
Go first.

589
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,360
- Go in first. - No, you leave first.

590
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,370
I'll be more at ease if I see you go in.

591
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,900
No, it's okay. Leave first.

592
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,940
- Just go in first. - No, leave first.

593
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,840
- I'll leave after I see you go in. - Go first.

594
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,640
He said go in!

595
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,780
Just go inside!

596
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,610
Wait.

597
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,950
Why again?

598
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,150
I just want to see her face one more time.

599
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,790
Click.

600
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,860
I'm taking a picture. I'll be looking
at it when I miss you tonight.

601
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:47,170
Like this? Click. Click, click, click.

602
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,740
Ah, you're so cute.

603
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,400
Hey. Go inside.

604
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,390
He isn't the type of guy to drink and drive.

605
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,890
I can't understand it either.

606
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,860
Since that day was my second son's last
day of vacation from military service,

607
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,900
we decided to have dinner at home together.

608
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,630
On such a day, why did he
drink and go all the way there?

609
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,710
It seems like an intentional accident.

610
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:33,850
How could it be? The police say it's
a driving under the influence case.

611
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:38,050
It will just make things harder
for you to think that way.

612
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,150
It's me. Me!

613
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,480
What are you doing?

614
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,420
- Hey, let me look at the bracelet.
Just once! - Are you going at it again?

615
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,230
- I just want to confirm something. - Confirm what?

616
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,030
There is something.

617
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,300
Aren't you going to tell me the truth?

618
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,730
Well, Si Ah is currently working
on artifacts from a shipwreck.

619
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:33,070
The artifacts belonged to
someone named Dam Ryeong.

620
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:38,340
Isn't it interesting? It is possible that they
are two different people with the same name.

621
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,310
However, if it's the same person

622
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:45,050
it will be more than $6 million!
Let me have it appraised at least.

623
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:49,250
- Hyung, do you know why I keep that bracelet? - Why?

624
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,260
So that I can return it to Cheong when
she leaves. If I give it back to her now,

625
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,860
people like you won't leave it alone.

626
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,000
You are really strange these days.

627
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,300
Do you all of sudden aspire
to be a decent human being?

628
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,770
Leave.

629
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:21,850
Heo Joon Jae, you're scary. I'm leaving.

630
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,640
Se Hwa!

631
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,780
Strange things keep happening
since I've met that dummy.

632
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:06,200
Whoa, my Cheong, did you know how to doll up?

633
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,700
Whoa, dressed like that, you look beautiful!

634
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,570
Doesn't she, Tae Oh? Look at him.
He's speechless. Whoa.

635
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,240
What the...?

636
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,150
It's cold. It's winter.

637
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,650
Joon Jae, Cheong's also wearing a skirt!

638
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,180
Change into a pair of pants.

639
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,490
Why? It's the one you bought for me last time.

640
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:33,130
- Do you think I bought it for you to
wear when going outside? - You didn't?

641
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:37,100
I bought it for you to hang in the closet.

642
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,660
Do you think that makes sense?

643
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,020
Of course, it does!

644
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,870
Not all clothes are made for wearing.
Some are made for being hung in the closet!

645
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,110
Go change it to pants and leave your hair untied.

646
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,780
Hey, why are you trying to
regulate her her hair and clothing?

647
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,880
Are you her student affairs teacher?

648
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:00,750
I'm the house owner. Hyung, you go and
change your clothes as well! Are you Rudoph?

649
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:05,020
All of you'd better listen to me.
If you don't want to, then leave.

650
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,900
Whoa, my Cheong,
your chopstick skills have improved a lot!

651
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,980
Cheong, where are you going today?
Do you want me to give you a ride?

652
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,210
Yes, I have plans later...

653
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:31,650
Don't you think you need to clean the house
or something to pay for your stay here?

654
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,350
Of course, I can clean. I saw how Tae Oh does it.

655
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,650
It's quite dusty these days

656
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,990
because we haven't been able to open the
windows to circulate the air as it's been cold.

657
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,930
Wipe down well so there won't be any dust.

658
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,260
I can do that.

659
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:46,470
It's my house. I'll make whomever I want to do it.

660
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:50,240
Also, you'll see a fan in the storage.
It will be very dusty.

661
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,900
We won't use it until next summer.

662
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,570
That's why we have to clean it now.

663
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,380
Are you the evil step-mother? (as in
Cinderella &amp; etc) Cheong, just run off!

664
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:01,780
Don't you dare! You won't be able to step
out at all before you finish them all.

665
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,660
What is it?

666
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,730
I forgot my phone.

667
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,120
Ah, it feels nice!

668
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,200
Why do you think the mermaids
are on the brink of extinction?

669
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,110
Because we don't change.

670
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:40,280
Humans change but, like idiots, we don't
change. That's why we get stabbed in the back.

671
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,210
Humans change?

672
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:47,090
They do. The woman I loved did, too.

673
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,960
Even though she said she'd love me forever.

674
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:56,830
When she found about who I really
am, she left. Just like that.

675
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:01,730
At first, I regretted coming to land.

676
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:06,300
It was hard, but it's our reality.

677
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:19,620
There is no human on earth who can
accept us as mermaids, the way we are.

678
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,960
The man you love is the same.

679
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:33,130
So, get your act together

680
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,000
and don't ever get caught.

681
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,680
♬ Sunlight beaming on a clear day ♬

682
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,350
♬ A warm breeze envelops us ♬

683
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:57,260
Epilogue

684
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,990
Hello, could I have a moment?

685
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,600
Excuse me, but could I ask what you do for a living?

686
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,900
I'm a civil servant.

687
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,500
Oh, a civil servant. I see.

688
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,670
You know civil servants.
We don't make big money, but it's stable,

689
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:17,810
and our jobs are tenured and give pensions.

690
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:23,050
Frankly, it is a job to provide
support for someone comfortably.

691
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,080
Ah, I do know that, but...

692
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,850
Could I ask you a question, too?

693
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:31,760
What do you do, Mr. Heo Joon Jae?

694
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:38,200
If it's hard to answer, you don't need to.

695
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,200
Anyway, please do take good care
of my Cheong for the time being.

696
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,170
Well, you don't need to ask me to do that.
I will make sure—

697
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:50,410
I mean, WE will figure it out.

698
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:58,470
You would think the time is...
and the opportunities are...

699
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:01,020
always available to you, don't you?

700
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,190
They are not!

701
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:13,900
What is he? What is he babbling
about, acting all cool?

702
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,930
He's a joke, seriously!

703
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:23,010
♬ So frustrating that you don't know ♬

704
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:27,810
♬ Fool, I love you right now ♬

705
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:32,480
How to Become 7th Grade Civil Servant

706
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,050
