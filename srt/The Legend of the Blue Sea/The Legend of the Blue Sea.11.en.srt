1
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,280
A long time ago, a boy loved a mermaid

2
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,020
and heard her voice.

3
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,420
Am I... that boy?

4
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,990
He was the boy who loved the
mermaid and heard her voice.

5
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,060
But he didn't know one important thing.

6
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,200
That mermaids have a special ability.

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,940
That she could erase herself from
a human's memories with a kiss.

8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,810
Even if you erase my memories over and over...

9
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,250
Even if he's born in a different world,

10
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,550
he is a boy whose fate is
to love the mermaid again.

11
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,360
Please save me.

12
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,390
I'm also different.

13
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,960
- Heo Joon Jae... - If he knows I'm different,

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,060
Heo Joon Jae will probably hate me, right?
He'll probably leave me, right?

15
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,400
Don't come, Heo Joon Jae!

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,740
My secret is that I'm different from you.

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,740
That I'm a mermaid.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:48,350
So in the end, he is the boy who will
eventually hear the mermaid's voice again.

19
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,010
I love you.

20
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,890
He was...

21
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,890
me.

22
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,940
- Excuse me, have you seen someone
who looks like this?  - No.

23
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,040
- Excuse me, have you seen
someone who looks like this?- No.

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,620
Today is the day when the Black Moon will appear.

25
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,530
The Black Moon is the second new
moon in a single calendar month.

26
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,900
It's said that the moon
disappears into the darkness,

27
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,630
and that's how it got stuck
with the name Black Moon.

28
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,440
In the past, it was thought to be an ominous sign.

29
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,340
Yang Seung Gil sent a message
to the Hanyang official Jo Bong Hak,

30
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,920
whom he's been sending bribes,

31
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,030
claiming that Dam Ryeong,
the town head of Heupgok village,

32
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,930
is bewitched by the wicked mermaid
and is disturbing the public,

33
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,130
and that you had framed him for murder.

34
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,500
Thereafter, Jo Bong Hak has submitted a written
petition to the King. What shall we do?

35
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,480
In addition, Yang's underlings are casting
all kinds of fishing nets every day,

36
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,010
frantically trying to capture the mermaid.

37
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,760
- Open the door  - Yes.

38
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,340
My Lord, why are you like this?

39
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,940
Die.

40
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,380
And don't ever be born again.

41
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,590
Why are my dreams like this?

42
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,700
It's a real mermaid.

43
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,270
Just watch and see. I will make that mermaid
mine again, no matter what it takes.

44
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,970
That naive town head...

45
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,940
I will get rid of him with my own hand.

46
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,540
Die and don't ever be born again.

47
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,950
Heo Joon Jae...

48
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,520
and the mermaid.

49
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,930
Legend of the Blue Sea

50
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,970
Episode 11

51
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,610
Refund all of this for money.

52
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,050
All of this?

53
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,990
Did Cheong not come yet?

54
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,290
Tae Oh was looking at the CCTVs
of the house and the neighborhood,

55
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,410
and you know those bags from the
Gangnam department store?

56
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,560
I think she was carrying those out.

57
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,770
- To do what with those? - I don't know. Maybe
she's selling them and getting a rental room.

58
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,670
Why would she get a rental room,
leaving her own house? Move!

59
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,840
Is this Cheong's house? It's your house.
You'd always say it's your house.

60
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,110
Where did she go?
Did you see the department store?

61
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,250
- Do you think it's easy to get inside the
department store? - Do it quickly! Quickly!

62
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,450
Are you really a hacker?

63
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,800
Do you know how many people
are in a department store?

64
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,220
Do you think it's easy to find her? When will we?

65
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,720
Find her location with your phone.

66
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,660
It's turned off.

67
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,660
Hey, I somehow have this bad feeling about
this. Did she leave for good, by chance?

68
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,670
Thank you for renewing the
contract with favorable conditions.

69
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,940
Of course, I should. You've maintained
good relations with my father.

70
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,740
I hardly ever see CEO Heo anymore.

71
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,810
Oh, my father's condition is not that great.

72
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,910
Well, since his son is so dependable
like this, he is entrusting it to you.

73
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,250
Oh...

74
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,660
Wait... She shouldn't be riding that.

75
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,370
Oh!

76
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,010
It's time to close the shop,
and there are no customers here,

77
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,310
- so let's just leave her for a bit. - Ah, yes.

78
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,520
My secret is that I'm different from you.

79
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,060
That I'm a mermaid.

80
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,260
If you find out who I am, you're going
to be surprised, hurt, and scared of me.

81
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,200
You're going to leave me.

82
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,640
So I'm trying my best to not get found out.

83
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,260
Did I come into some kind of children's book? Or...

84
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,230
Did you come out to the world?

85
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,750
You guys match each other so well,

86
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,980
so when are you guys planning to marry?

87
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,490
We will soon. We're thinking about
Dubai or Europe early next year.

88
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,330
Oh my! I see!

89
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,230
That's right. I'm a person who lies.

90
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,770
I cheat others and get money off
of cheating them. That's right.

91
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,270
I'm that kind of person. That is my secret.

92
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,240
What's yours?

93
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,620
Oh? Heo Joon Jae's family?

94
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,690
Ah, just call me Heo Chi Hyeon.

95
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,120
Mr. Heo Chi Hyeon.

96
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,260
Yes. Thank you.

97
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,060
But did you come by yourself? What about Joon Jae?

98
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There are a lot of pretty and good things here.

99
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,170
There wasn't anything like this where I lived.

100
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,780
Where is it? Wherever it is,
there's bound to be a Christmas.

101
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,810
There's a place where there's not.

102
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,090
Where's your house?

103
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,320
I live with Heo Joon Jae.

104
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,620
You live together?

105
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,630
I'm the upper room; he's the lower room.

106
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,900
Heo Joon Jae's the house owner.

107
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,370
Ah, I see.

108
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,670
You didn't bring a car, right?

109
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,140
Should I give you a ride?

110
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,810
Then instead of driving me home,
will you drive me to that place?

111
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,020
Ah, you're really going to sleep here?

112
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,450
Yes. Looking at the TV, there were a lot of people
who sleep here when they come out of the house.

113
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,890
Well, okay, but be safe.

114
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,430
Bye.

115
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,200
Cheong Hae Spa SaunaMen / Women

116
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,370
- Oh, wait! - Hey, you!

117
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,840
- What are you doing? - Hey!

118
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,180
This is the women's side. No!

119
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,510
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,180
Here is the ladies' side.

121
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,590
She went inside well, right?

122
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,220
Will it take much longer?

123
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,860
To protect the VVIP room, there's no CCTV.

124
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,760
Ah, just do it quickly.

125
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,900
I did think it was very
nerve-wracking yesterday.

126
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,600
You guys weren't talking and were
just trying to out-stare each other.

127
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,310
Wow, when Cheong is like that, I feel
some type of unapproachable charisma.

128
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,640
- Hyung. - Yeah?

129
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,710
Do you know the story of the Little Mermaid?

130
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,650
Oh, my. So suddenly. Really sudden.

131
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,380
Well, isn't it like the mermaid princess goes up
to the land and falls in love with the prince?

132
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,160
Yeah, and the witch gave her legs,

133
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
but after midnight, it turned back to a tail,

134
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,730
and she couldn't wear her glass shoes, and the
prince was searching for the owner of the shoes...

135
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,360
Isn't that something else?

136
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,970
Cinderella.

137
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,340
You find this instead.

138
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,700
Aren't children's stories the same thing?

139
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,970
Like that, the prince and the mermaid
fall in love and get married. The end.

140
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,380
- Was it? - That's the Disney's version.
She dies in the original version.

141
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,410
- Dies? - I think so.

142
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,080
Who? The prince? The mermaid?

143
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,950
That's right! I think the mermaid died.

144
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,860
Why does the mermaid die?

145
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,160
What kind of lame children's story is that?

146
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,530
Yeah, I know. Kids read that
so why would they do that?

147
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,130
But why are we talking about that at dawn?

148
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,000
These days, they say that even kids don't
read the classic children's stories, either.

149
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,300
Ah, I don't know.

150
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,500
Hurry up and find her.

151
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,630
- Oh, it's refreshing.- Isn't it good?

152
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,350
Miss!

153
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,690
This is my spot!

154
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,660
What was that about?

155
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,020
Hello.

156
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,320
We meet again.

157
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,060
Ah, yes. Did Cheong perhaps come here?

158
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,460
What's the story that's read with great emotion?

159
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,330
What?

160
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,670
I think it's Romeo and Juliet.

161
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,010
I cried. Shakespeare isn't a maestro for nothing.

162
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,510
Did you see her? Cheong?

163
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,010
Sit here for a bit.

164
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:52,060
In this world, there are many love stories.
But from all those love stories,

165
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:56,500
if you take out the rhetoric
and unessential words,

166
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,470
there will be only one sentence left.
What do you think it is?

167
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,240
- What is it? - "Be good to her when she's with you."

168
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,100
Aish!

169
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,150
What I'm saying is that if you had treated
her well when she was with you,

170
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,570
she wouldn't have left.

171
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,880
You wouldn't be searching for her like
this, either. It's the eternal truth.

172
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,450
If you see Cheong,
tell her to make sure to contact me.

173
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,720
Make sure! For sure!

174
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,020
See? He should listen to me.
Otherwise, he will be regretting it later.

175
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,360
He's going to come back again.
He's going to come again.

176
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,830
I am here at this time on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

177
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,100
Come on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.
Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.

178
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,570
It is not possible to track the location.

179
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,520
Wow, daebak!

180
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,490
Daebak!

181
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,520
What does she do?

182
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,430
Hey, I can see something else. Let's look
for more things. Turn the cell phone on.

183
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,800
- Hey, hurry up! - Watch out for people.

184
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,630
Hey! I found that girl first!

185
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,870
- I'm the one who found the money.-
Hey, let's just divide equally.

186
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,470
Stop right there!

187
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,840
Hey, hey, hey! Stop! Stop! You guys are playing hard.

188
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,050
For now, give me the phone.

189
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,490
Where did you find this?

190
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,990
It's mine.

191
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,790
Oh, is that so?

192
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,470
Sim Cheong

193
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,070
It's my girlfriend's.

194
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,810
Where's my girlfriend?

195
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,510
- I don't know. - You guys can keep all
the money. Just tell me where she is.

196
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,080
- The Cheonghae Sauna in front of here.- Hey!- What?

197
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,460
Thanks! Friend, let's do a handshake.

198
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,030
- Who are you? - Argh! Seriously!

199
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,100
Me? I'm a scammer.

200
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,210
If you guys are like this, you'll turn out like me.

201
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,610
Later on, if the guy you like asks you what you do,

202
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,950
then you'll have to lie about everything. Lies.

203
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,820
Do you like that even then?

204
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,460
- Ah, what is this? He took everything!  - Ah, seriously!

205
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,600
My heart fluttered a bit just now. Bad-boy style.

206
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,300
He was a bit cool.

207
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,120
Did you sleep well?

208
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,990
No, I couldn't sleep,

209
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,660
and maybe that's why I have no appetite.

210
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,670
I was worried about you.

211
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,340
Since it was my day off, I came here.

212
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,140
It looks like your appetite came back.
Please eat it with this sweet rice shake.

213
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,200
You're a good person.

214
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,530
I don't have a name,
but I was told I'm not a strange person.

215
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,100
- Who? - Some good person.

216
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,480
Do you know me? You don't have anything
to say to me, right? Then don't follow me.

217
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,710
Then are you not leaving? Take that and leave.

218
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,920
♬ When I enter, my eyes are dazzled ♬

219
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,590
Heo Joon Jae.

220
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,830
♬  A wide world welcomes me ♬

221
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:11,110
♬ I approach you. I want to be embraced. ♬

222
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:17,950
♬ I want to stay in that world which is you ♬

223
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,490
♬ I owe you; I miss you  ♬

224
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,520
You seriously. Who told you to leave
the house and stay at a place like this?

225
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,590
Do you know how much I tried to find you?

226
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,090
♬ Eternally in your arms ♬

227
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,000
How did you know to come to this place?

228
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,600
Heo Chi Hyeon drove me here.

229
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,970
What?

230
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,640
- Why are you here? - Don't misunderstand.

231
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,910
We coincidentally met
each other outside yesterday,

232
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,850
and Cheong said that she didn't want to go home.

233
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,580
Not come?

234
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,880
- You said that? - Yeah, I did.

235
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,130
You go ahead.

236
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,500
And you. Let's talk somewhere private.

237
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,460
Heo Joon Jae. I got a refund for all
of those items I bought last time.

238
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,830
I don't need those clothes
anyway, so I'll return it to you.

239
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,130
Yeah, I got it well.

240
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,370
What happened?

241
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,640
Take care of your phone too.

242
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,010
How do you have that?

243
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:54,780
I'm also a bad guy, but there are a lot
more people who are worse than me here.

244
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,520
So please be careful.

245
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,220
What about food? Did you eat?

246
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,360
I ate an egg and drank a rice shake.

247
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,830
Is there anything else you want to eat?

248
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,930
No.

249
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,910
Spicy rice cakes, blood sausages, seaweed rolls,

250
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,850
strawberry-flavored shaved ice,
melon-flavored shaved ice,

251
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,370
fried dumplings, steamed dumplings,
round-shaped dough seaweed soup.

252
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,330
I see you don't have an appetite.

253
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,540
I thought you would come,
so I made grilled ribs at home.

254
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,110
Ah, beef ribs are the best when seasoned.

255
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,710
It's seasoned beef ribs.

256
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,410
Wow, it must be so tender.

257
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,610
It's really tender.

258
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,580
I thought it was melting in my mouth.

259
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm fine.

260
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,890
I want to eat it, seasoned beef ribs.

261
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,860
So, you're really not going to come?

262
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,560
I'm not.

263
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,370
- Really? - Yeah.

264
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,970
- Why? - Because you're a con artist.

265
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:56,140
You're a bad bastard who tricks people.
You tricked me too.

266
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:04,320
But why am I not disappointed in
you, when you're a bad guy?

267
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,650
Why can't I leave you, who fooled me?

268
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,930
If you don't want to come home, stay here.

269
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:20,030
Instead, don't go anywhere else. Stay here.

270
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:27,240
You can't leave without even saying goodbye.

271
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,610
Okay.

272
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,480
You promised.

273
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,480
Then... I'm leaving.

274
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,050
I said I'm leaving.

275
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,990
Go.

276
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,850
What the heck? "Don't go, Heo Joon Jae."

277
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,250
I thought she would say something
like that. Why is she so cold-hearted?

278
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,300
Joon Jae. Father is ill these days.

279
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
And?

280
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:44,650
Why? Where and how is he ill?

281
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,890
The doctor said it was cataracts.
His eyesight has been impaired quite a lot.

282
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,960
I told you to work hard at
fulfilling the duty of a son.

283
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,930
Escort him to the hospital well.

284
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,830
He's a father you had from the start,

285
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,040
but he's the first father I ever had.

286
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,410
Fine, as you said, it may be that I'm
the fake son acting as the real one.

287
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,750
I was grateful that he became my dad.

288
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:25,020
So I always want to be in his
favor and want to protect him.

289
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,590
Sure.

290
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:34,730
Be grateful. Continue to be in his
favor, and make sure to protect him.

291
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,740
In order for my father to become yours,

292
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,640
there are many things that he failed
to protect and ended up losing.

293
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,320
You received the official document, right?

294
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,330
Yes. In 1988, Sujeong-dong # 423.

295
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,230
You want the resident registration
of the family that moved in, right?

296
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,000
- Yes, thank you. - Of course.

297
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,870
April 15, 1988, Ma Dae Young moved in.

298
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,210
There's another resident that moved
in to the same house on the same day.

299
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,070
Kang Ji Hyeon?

300
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,410
Did Ma Dae Yeong marry?

301
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,550
No. Ma Dae Young's previous
records are complicated,

302
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,850
but his family relationships are simple.
He's an orphan and has never been married.

303
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,890
Kang Ji Hyeon. Who is that?

304
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,720
It's not a name that came up even
during the initial investigation.

305
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,680
Even when I asked the construction
people he last worked with,

306
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,630
they said he didn't have a woman.

307
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,230
Kang Ji Hyeon, Kang Ji Hyeon...

308
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,570
Get a copy of Kang Ji Hyeon's resident
registration form and her family register.

309
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,930
Resident Registration Form - Kang Ji Hyeon

310
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,470
She married twice.

311
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,340
Both of her husbands died.

312
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,710
Family Register: Kang Ji Hyeon Husband:
Kim Tae HeumHusband: Park Sang Jin

313
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,250
The woman was beautiful.

314
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,920
That must have been why the man
married her, even with a child.

315
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,150
She brought the child with
her when she got married?

316
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,660
Of course.

317
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,960
But, the husband suddenly died.

318
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,200
- A year after their marriage. - Why?

319
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,500
A husband that was perfectly fine in
the beginning lost his sight somehow.

320
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,870
- He lost his sight?  - Yes, he lost his sight.

321
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,840
He probably went outside with those eyes he
couldn't see with and died in a car accident.

322
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,880
That woman was an insurance agent.

323
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,280
A little bit after their marriage,
her husband's eyesight started to worsen.

324
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,120
I heard he died of some complications.

325
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,160
Honey. How are you feeling?

326
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,370
I'll have to visit Doctor Kim again. The medicine...

327
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,410
It doesn't seem like it's working.

328
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,450
I called Doctor Kim.

329
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,920
First, you should
diligently take your medicine.

330
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,720
He said resting at home
after that would be the best.

331
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,890
Just rest.

332
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,660
Okay.

333
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,500
You can't contact them?

334
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,170
I can't.

335
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,040
Goo Baek's dad has been
completely ignoring my calls.

336
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,510
And as for CEO Kim's office, no matter how
much I call, they won't connect me to him.

337
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,050
That day, what did we do wrong?

338
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:45,020
No, up to the meal was good. It was, right?

339
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,590
It was. Did you see CEO Kim
eat two plates of egg rolls?

340
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,430
Exactly. After that,

341
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,470
what was the problem?

342
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,700
Getting ahead of yourself.

343
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,170
What did you say, Ahjumma?

344
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,610
When I was walking by, it seemed to be that

345
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,410
Ji Yong's dad was getting ahead of himself a bit.

346
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,160
They seemed like people he
was meeting for the first time,

347
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,850
but that he'd somehow get or
gain something from them...

348
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,680
I could see a hint of that desire.

349
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,450
From the other's perspective,
it could've been burdensome.

350
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,020
Ugh, I can't live because of you, Honey!

351
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:24,060
I hid that desire as much as I
could, but did it show?

352
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,560
I could see it.

353
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,400
What kind of people are they? Would they not know?

354
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,010
That's right. They were burdened.

355
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,080
Oh, I worked so hard to make
this occasion happen. Seriously!

356
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,280
Aigoo, because of you, it's all ruined!
What are you going to do?

357
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,950
I can't live because of you!

358
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,590
I mean, why leave a warm house
and go to some sauna to sleep?

359
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,720
I just can't understand.

360
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,500
- Ugh, what about Cheong? Did you find her? - Yes.

361
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,870
Why? She wouldn't come with you?

362
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,340
The boiler in my room isn't
working, so it's too cold in there.

363
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,610
- I'm sleeping here tonight. - You know!

364
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,780
Shouldn't it be like this? If there is a problem,

365
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,750
you should face each other in the same place

366
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,620
and solve it through communication!

367
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,820
Why, did Cheong say she didn't want to come home?

368
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,520
Where did she learn that bad
habit of running away from home?!

369
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,190
I don't think that's something for you to say
when you ran away from home in high school.

370
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,430
What? She said she didn't want to come home?

371
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,970
Who did Cheong say that to?

372
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,400
There's some dumb ass like that.

373
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,170
He's a dumb ass, that bastard.

374
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,910
Did he treat you well?

375
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:50,150
He gave me an umbrella when it was
raining and held my hand when I was alone.

376
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,120
Hand...

377
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,220
He made ramen for me too.

378
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,390
Ra... Ramen?!

379
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,660
Wow... ramen.

380
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,800
He asked you to eat ramen with him?
Wow, what a pervert.

381
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,570
What's wrong?

382
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,330
That bastard...

383
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,700
- was me? - Huh?

384
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,910
Ramen!   He must look like
a pretty playboy, huh?

385
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,980
He's a crazy punk.
He's a completely materialistic playboy.

386
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,380
Don't hang out with people like that. You have
to be careful of guys who look like that.

387
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,950
I'm saying those guys are totally perverted!

388
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,960
- Hey! - That was me?

389
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,760
You dumb ass!

390
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,500
I'm that pretty playboy!

391
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,780
Wait.

392
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,050
So that guy...

393
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,520
was me.

394
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,460
Not some other guy.

395
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,020
What did you say?

396
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,330
No, that guy was me, Hyung.

397
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,370
It was me.

398
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,200
That guy was him... me.

399
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,010
Hey, I'll sleep in my room even if it's freezing.

400
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,280
- Hyung. - You should rest or take medicine.

401
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:33,650
♬ Idiot! It means it's you I'm waiting for ♬

402
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,060
♬ That's what's happening, idiot.
My heart will keep beating ♬

403
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,760
♬ Why don't you know my heart  ♬

404
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,670
♬ That warm blowing breeze is ♬

405
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:53,310
♬ whispering to me it is today, ♬

406
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,010
♬ I'm going to give you my ♬

407
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,180
♬ pent-up confession of love. ♬

408
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
That bastard...

409
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,240
Aigoo!

410
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,140
Sorry. I can't see that well.

411
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:53,000
♬  More than any word your eyes  ♬

412
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,500
♬ mean more, I can sense it ♬

413
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,310
♬ In last night's dream while you smiled ♬

414
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:09,780
♬ You were blowing like the wind ♬

415
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,420
♬ On the path I walked alone
In the dream I chased alone ♬

416
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,690
♬ You are at my side now ♬

417
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,560
It's Heo Joon Jae.

418
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,700
♬ Why will I remember it forever? ♬

419
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,740
Don't open your eyes, Heo Joon Jae.

420
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,800
Don't wake up, Heo Joon Jae.

421
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,510
Just stay like this. So I can see you.

422
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,940
So I can make up for the time I couldn't see you.

423
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,550
I don't have to ask you anything,

424
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,220
and you don't need to hide
anything from me either.

425
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,750
Don't open your eyes, Heo Joon Jae.

426
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,260
♬ From the moment you come to me ♬

427
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:58,330
♬ Come a step closer ♬

428
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,230
Ah, it's cold.

429
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,810
♬ My heart is leaning toward you ♬

430
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,340
Heo Joon Jae will be cold too.

431
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,710
Ah, why is it so hot?

432
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,250
♬ Bit by bit ♬

433
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,290
It's so warm.

434
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,270
Ahjumma.

435
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,250
Ahjumma.

436
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,290
What the heck? Where did she go?

437
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,700
Her son is handsome.

438
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,670
What are you doing?

439
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,410
Ah. I was wondering where the homemade
kimchi was. I have someone to give it to.

440
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,840
Is kimchi there?

441
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,640
Follow me.

442
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,710
Yes.

443
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:36,060
Joon Jae, you like the side dishes at our
place, so I just packed some and came here.

444
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,070
That's right.
The food at your place is really good.

445
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,820
Do you want to visit our house sometime?

446
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,240
It'll be even tastier because
the food will still be warm.

447
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,410
Well, in the case of food,

448
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,250
I like it cooler. I'll just eat it here.

449
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,220
Me too. I like it cooler too. It's weird.

450
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,720
Exactly.

451
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,960
Is Cheong gone for good?

452
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,190
Well, I guess she'll be back
after making up with Joon Jae.

453
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,300
What are you looking at?

454
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,690
Tae Ho. You can't be that
obvious in front of other people!

455
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,890
Me?

456
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,760
I thought you were a smart kid.

457
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,930
Truly, in front of love we're all helpless.

458
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,630
Earlier, you were jealous of
Joon Jae and glaring at him.

459
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,270
That's because of me right now.

460
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,070
Is it that hard looking at my face?

461
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:59,010
No. I've forgotten it all. It's the truth, Noona.

462
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,350
You want to make my heart
comfortable, even with lies?

463
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:10,260
Love isn't something that
can be broken off so easily.

464
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,390
Why wouldn't I know it?

465
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,230
Do you have my number?

466
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,430
Give me your phone.

467
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,170
Why? It's fine.

468
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,340
It's okay, give it to me.

469
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,710
Give it to me.

470
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,750
If it's too hard, don't hold it in and call me.
If you miss someone too much, you'll become sick.

471
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:44,090
Even though this noona can't give you
her heart, she can buy drinks for you.

472
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,380
They call something like this a picture of rice
cakes. (looks so tasty but is unattainable)

473
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,390
A disaster almost happened.

474
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:25,400
If I had fallen in the water,
he would've found out all about it.

475
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,870
Hey. If you slip and fall in these places,
you'll get a concussion at the very least!

476
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,240
Be careful!

477
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,310
- Are you okay? - Heo Joon Jae, are you okay?

478
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,250
You got all wet.

479
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,280
I'm fine.

480
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,720
No, if you're going make splashes, you should go to
a swimming pool! What are you doing in foot spa?

481
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,990
What the heck? What's wrong with you?

482
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,830
What the heck! I'm going through
all kinds of stuff here, seriously.

483
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,760
This won't do. All the strategic points here
are all too dangerous. Let's leave for now.

484
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,200
No, is there anywhere dry? A dry place?

485
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:14,150
Hey, you should be careful! How can you
spill water like that? It's dangerous!

486
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,720
Omo! Water isn't dangerous!

487
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,540
How is water not dangerous?

488
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,490
It's the most dangerous. If you use it improperly,
it can reach the electrical outlet.

489
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:25,960
If you put your nose in a bowl of
water, a person could die!

490
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,260
Let's go.

491
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,460
Are you okay?

492
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,900
These rascals! Stop!

493
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,870
Play by yourselves in that ice room.

494
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,090
You know how far that water gun can reach?

495
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,840
Don't you think that it might
hit an innocent person's leg?

496
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,840
That's a weapon, weapon! Go! Go!

497
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,880
Those little kids with weapons.

498
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,190
He's not normal!

499
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,330
Do you have any long pants? For women?

500
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,700
Excuse me! All of our pants are shorts.

501
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,830
Don't you need to make one?

502
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,740
Long pants or a long skirt. A wide one.
One that comes up to here.

503
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,040
There were a lot of dangerous things in there.

504
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,550
- Honey, when are you going to go home?  - Excuse me?

505
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,720
Well, I've had a couple's quarrel as well.

506
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,120
In my state of staying at sauna, it may be a
bit awkward to say this kind of thing, but

507
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:36,900
we're so very uncomfortable
because of your husband!

508
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,660
She's right.

509
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,330
My husband?

510
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:44,070
It's your husband, not mine.
Your husband is too peculiar.

511
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,870
- We're getting annoyed here! - Right, right.

512
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,340
Can you just go back home?

513
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,350
I don't know what the reason
is, but just make up. Hmm?

514
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,980
Go back when he's asking you to,
as if you're being forced to.

515
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,950
Look at me. I live right by the
intersection, but he's not coming.

516
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,020
He knows I'm here, but he's not coming.

517
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,030
I've already lost the timing.
I have to crawl in by my own means.

518
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:12,730
Just go home! We can't live here at
the sauna because of your husband!

519
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,070
Just go! Please!

520
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,940
Wow, really.

521
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,140
Elizabeth!

522
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,040
Mom!

523
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,040
Aiyoo.

524
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,150
What about Yoo Na?

525
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,550
I don't know.

526
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,820
I told you to go around with her!

527
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,260
From what I see, she is the CEO Kim's
hidden line of influential power.

528
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,460
What's that?

529
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,530
There's something like that.

530
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,530
Omo, Yoo Na! Hi!

531
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:46,700
Hello.

532
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,670
Oh, that's right.

533
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,640
Oh, you said you wanted to learn how to swim.

534
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,440
Tell your mom that we'll put you
in Elizabeth's swimming team.

535
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,310
Yes, thank you.

536
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,010
That's right.

537
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:07,190
Ah, and also... That unni at the convenience store.

538
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:12,290
When you see that unni again,
you can tell her about me.

539
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,330
Yes.

540
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,530
What are you going to tell her?

541
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:19,300
Some ajumma is strangely
being nice to me these days.

542
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:28,170
Oh, okay. I see,
you're quite an honest and nice child.

543
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,340
How about this?

544
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,710
These days, Elizabeth's mom is
taking care of me so well that

545
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,950
I want to go to school!

546
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:42,190
These days, Elizabeth's mom is taking care
of me so well that I want to go to school.

547
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,520
Really?

548
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,260
No.

549
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:52,500
I just said that because she told me to
say it. I don't want to go to school.

550
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,130
Why?

551
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,870
Soon, there's going to be a show,
and we're supposed to invite our families.

552
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:02,540
But, I really hate that.

553
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,580
I don't have anyone to come for me.

554
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,210
Is your mom busy again?

555
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,350
Last year, and when I was in kindergarten,

556
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:17,090
even if I sang and danced, no one watched me.

557
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:20,060
There was no one who waved to me.

558
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,900
It was boring.

559
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:31,640
- Ahjussi, you're fake, right?
- Mom, Santa smells like smoke.

560
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,240
I saw it on TV. On Christmas, Santa gives
you presents and makes your wish come true.

561
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,380
Unni, are you a kid?

562
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,020
If you want to do that, then you can't cry.

563
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,820
I've already cried multiple
times, so it won't work.

564
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,490
I've cried several times too.

565
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,100
I'm saying it won't work for us.

566
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,210
What if I ask that person to?

567
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:18,350
Ahjussi, can you tell Santa what my wish is?

568
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,920
Ah, it's not something that I can deliver,

569
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,860
but write it on one of these and hang
it on the tree. He'll probably read it.

570
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,230
You really can't tell him?

571
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,560
Wh-What?

572
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,230
I would like you to tell Santa my wish too.

573
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:40,470
I cried several times,
but that was because of a situation.

574
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,210
So I want to explain. Can I contact him in any way?

575
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,110
Contact him? Probably. I could.

576
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,320
If you give me your phone number, I'll call him.

577
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,650
Ah, my phone number?

578
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,620
Here.

579
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,030
I wish that Mom and Dad would
come to the presentation.

580
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,950
Look here. Ah, you're so pretty.

581
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,650
Pose. Looking cute!

582
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,750
Ah, our Elizabeth is so pretty today.

583
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,660
Omo! Yoo Na! Yoo Na! Hi!

584
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,290
Hello.

585
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,160
Hi, your mom didn't come today?

586
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,900
Yoo Na's mom usually doesn't come to these.

587
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,970
That's because she's busy.

588
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,040
Seo Yoo Na.

589
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,850
Omo.

590
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,190
Do well. Your mom asked me.

591
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,760
She asked me to wave to you, take
pictures, and cheer you on in her place.

592
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:09,060
Hello.

593
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,060
Oh, I guess you're quite close with Yoo Na's mom.

594
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,870
Yes. We're totally BFFs.

595
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,110
You're here already.

596
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,090
CEO Kim Jay!

597
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,290
I'm a little late.

598
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:39,390
No, I just came too.

599
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,690
How did you know?

600
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,430
What's there I don't know?

601
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,470
Oh, kiddo. Aigoo.

602
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,410
You're the prettiest here.

603
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:57,210
- Do well. I'll only be looking at you. - Okay.

604
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,880
Omo, Goo Baek's dad!

605
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,910
Well, hello.

606
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,350
- I called so many times!  - Oh, did you?

607
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,920
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

608
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,250
Oh, you were here.

609
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,490
It's so nice to see you here!

610
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:11,860
Yes, yes.

611
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,460
- Hello.  - It's nice to see you.

612
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,800
She's such a nice kid.

613
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,530

622
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,290
Unni, Oppa, you two stand together too.

623
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,930
Did I change from an Ahjussi to an Oppa?

624
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:57,630
I'll take the picture for you.

625
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,310
Eh, get closer together, please.

626
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,760
I'm happy.

- To Sungnamdong, please.  - It's
my day off, today. I'm not working.

628
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,130
Oh, no. Let's go. What to do? He's not working.

629
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,090
Look at that. How nice is it
that Cheong's coming back home?

630
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,610
During the time Cheong wasn't here,
the refrigerator was full,

631
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,160
but my heart was totally empty.

632
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,760
Me too. I lied today because of Yoo
Na, but it was doable.

633
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,470
Isn't that right? In the world,
there's something called a white lie.

634
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:12,340
But you guys tell more than just white lies.

635
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:16,200
Cheong, are you attending some speech academy?

636
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,340
How did your speaking
skill suddenly skyrocket?

637
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:25,120
Heo Joon Jae. Can you promise me

638
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,750
that you'll only tell good lies?

639
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:32,390
Promise me you won't tell lies
that will hurt other people.

640
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:38,060
Well, you want me to promise
in front of these guys?

641
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,100
Yeah.

642
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,110
I promise.

643
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,740
- Really?  - Yeah.

644
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,180
I won't. Ever.

645
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:01,490
Did I hear something wrong? Or is this a lie too?

646
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,060
Go in first. I'm going to go
somewhere with Cheong for a bit.

647
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,430
Let's go.

648
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,280
Stay here for a little bit. Don't go anywhere.

649
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,170
- Did you call for backup?  - Yes.
But what if it's a false alarm again?

650
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,210
What if it's not?

651
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,710
Someone reported seeing Ma Dae Young here.

652
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:03,050
There are so many people.

653
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,720
- Go over there. - Okay.

654
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,050
Heo Joon Jae.

655
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:38,380
When I crossed the long ocean to find you,

656
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:42,420
I saw these pretty stars every night.

657
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:49,760
But I was lonely because I was alone.
I was tired. I was scared.

658
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,100
But right now, is it okay to be this comfortable?

659
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,070
Is it okay to be happy?

660
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:00,110
Is it okay to love?

661
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,020
Wow, I was right.

662
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,560
This eel-like bastard.

663
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,470
I feel like I came to catch a tiger
and I caught a rabbit,

664
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:24,530
but having caught one is
having caught one anyway.

665
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,400
Hyung, request some backup
support to the square.

666
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,440
I'll go.

667
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:39,340
I'll follow you quietly, so don't call anyone.

668
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:49,990
Heo Joon Jae, come quickly.

669
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:57,700
That boy loved the mermaid, so he heard her voice.

670
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:03,070
Even if she erased and re-erased his memories,
even if he was reborn in another world,

671
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:08,310
it was the boy's fate to love the mermaid again.

672
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:17,520
So that in the end,
he came to hear the mermaid's voice again.

673
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,450
It was...

674
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:23,120
none other than me.

675
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:33,030
♬ Somewhere and sometime, as I met and loved you ♬

676
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:40,710
♬ If I see you like someone
receding in the distance ♬

677
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:46,140
♬ Somewhere within me keeps aching ♬

678
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:53,450
♬ Somewhere sometime we will again grow apart ♬

679
00:57:53,450 --> 00:58:01,060
♬ I am afraid of being forgotten ♬

680
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:08,530
♬ Even for the moment when I'm holding your hand ♬

681
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,840
I would like it if you told Santa my wish too.

682
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,020
I cried several times,
but that was because I had a situation.

683
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:26,650
So I want to explain.
Is there any way to contact him?

684
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:30,390
Contact...will probably work. It most likely will.

685
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,860
If you give me your phone number, then I'll...

686
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,160
Ah. My phone number.

687
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,640
- Excuse me. - Yes?

688
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,210
Can you really contact Santa?

689
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:50,780
I'm asking if you can.

690
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,610
I think you got my girlfriend's number earlier,
saying that you would give it to Santa.

691
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,920
If you can really contact him,
I have something to say as well.

692
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,290
Ah, I see. She was your girlfriend.

693
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,490
You didn't memorize it, right?

694
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:13,800
Please let my mom and dad
come to the presentation.

695
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,120
I wish that I would have a date with
Heo Joon Jae under a pretty tree.

696
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,310
This year, the next, and the one after as well.

697
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:26,880
I wish I could keep all of
the promises I made to you.
