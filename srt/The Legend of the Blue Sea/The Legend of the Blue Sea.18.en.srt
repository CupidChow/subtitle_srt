00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,280
Episode 18

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,770
If I were to be born again, I'd like to be once again

3
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,070
my wife's husband and my son's father.

4
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,180
That's what I wish for. It's probably my greed.

5
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,320
I am sorry, Joon Jae. I love you, my son.

6
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,810
Father.

7
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,980
Father.

8
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,860
Is this 119? We have an emergency patient here.

9
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,240
Any recent medications?

10
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,780
I'm not sure. He recently had an emergency
surgery due to a cerebral hemorrhage.

11
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,040
He was also scheduled to
receive cataract surgery,

12
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,750
so he was probably taking
medications related to that.

13
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,100
There are no other injuries,

14
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,160
and looking at the spot coloring,
there was no reaction to toxic chemicals.

15
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,690
Seeing that his lips are blue,
it seems to be myocardial infarction,

16
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,160
but we'll have more details after
further examination.

17
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,230
Where is your mother?

18
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,810
She is out. She told me over the phone that
she had an appointment about two hours ago.

19
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,110
- So she doesn't know that your
father passed away yet?- That's right.

20
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,050
I haven't had a chance to tell her yet.

21
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,990
I thought she would be in too
much shock when she found out.

22
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,950
Oh, I see.

23
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,590
Then, let's move him to the hospital that has
his medical records. Would you agree to it?

24
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,800
Yes.

25
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,170
Ah, Father!

26
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,170
Father! What do we do now!

27
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,460
No!

28
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,170
No, wait! Wait! Father!

29
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
It's not time yet, Father!

30
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,550
Dad!

31
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,190
Dad, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

32
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,600
After the post-mortem examination,

33
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,900
an official document to proceed
with the funeral will be issued.

34
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,330
If you prepare for the funeral,
I think it will work out.

35
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,370
Alright.

36
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,200
I will do that.

37
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,010
Heo Chi Hyeon.

38
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,620
Come here. Come here, you bastard!

39
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,290
What are you doing? Who are you?

40
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,160
Because of you, my father...
Because of you and that woman!

41
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,770
I won't leave you alone! I'll kill you.
I'll kill both of you!!

42
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,570
Is this guy crazy?! Why are you doing this?

43
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,970
Get off!

44
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,720
You murderers! You guys killed my father!

45
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,390
Who are you? I asked who are you?

46
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,760
I am... I am Heo Il Joong's son!

47
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm his son...

48
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,230
He is right. He is my younger brother.

49
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:02,770
Younger brother? I am your younger brother?
What are you?! What are you, bastard!

50
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,110
- What do you think you are?
- Let go! Do you want to get arrested?

51
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,650
- Do something about it here! Hey!  -
What do you think you are? Let go of me!

52
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,960
- Hold him, hold him, hold him. - Let go!

53
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,930
Do not touch him, jerks!

54
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,600
Get off. Don't touch him.

55
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,840
Heo Joon Jae. Get a hold of yourself now.

56
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,170
That's right. Come to your senses.

57
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,950
Father...

58
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,220
Father has passed away.

59
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,260
I should have stopped it,

60
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,930
but I couldn't.

61
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,500
That's why you need to come to your senses,
punk. You need to find everything out.

62
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,900
Why your father became like that...
You need to find out.

63
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,010
Go to your father for now.
I'll take care of things here. Okay?

64
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,840
Hey! Officer Cha!

65
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,180
What are you doing?

66
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,980
What happened to Heo Joon Jae?
I'm so worried that I can't even sleep.

67
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,290
Since Officer Hong went there,
I'm sure he will let us know.

68
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,290
But my Cheong, there's something I'm curious
about. Can I ask you about something?

69
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,760
You said it earlier.

70
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,070
Ma Dae Young. It's Ma Dae Young,
since he can't remember anything right now.

71
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,570
What can he not remember?

72
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,570
Who he is, what he has done so far.

73
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,740
Did Ma Dae Young really lose all his memory?

74
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,210
How would you know that?

75
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,180
Could it be that our Cheong
made Ma Dae Young like that?

76
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,980
Why are you asking something like that?

77
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,190
I never thought I knew you so well,

78
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:12,470
but these days, I really am not sure who you
are and what kind of ability you possess.

79
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,640
Who are you?

80
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,210
I am...

81
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,180
your friend.

82
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,620
Ah, friend.

83
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,950
But after I make someone believe I'm his friend,

84
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,260
my job is to be the friend
who stabs him in the back.

85
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,100
Although I don't like that you are that kind of
person, for me, once I become a friend, that's all.

86
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,240
Whether you back stab or not is your choice.

87
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,310
Once I get backstabbed,
I will think about what to do with you.

88
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,940
Until then, you are my friend.

89
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,790
- Why aren't you guys answering the call?
- You scared me. What's going on?

90
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,580
Can you erase me?

91
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,810
The memory of my father.

92
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,520
Heo Joon Jae.

93
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,820
You can do it, can't you?

94
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,060
Can you make me like that?

95
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,200
All the good memories

96
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,870
hurt because they were good.

97
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,300
Bad memories

98
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,810
hurt because they are bad.

99
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,050
All my memories of my father

100
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,220
hurt so much.

101
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,930
I still can't erase them.

102
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,900
No matter how much it hurts,
you loved your father.

103
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,600
It is said that you have hold on to
the memory of love even if it hurts.

104
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,910
If I had gotten there just a little sooner,

105
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,010
I could have saved father.

106
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,440
No.

107
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,220
If I hated him just a little less,

108
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,220
I could have saved my father.

109
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,190
No.

110
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,360
Just a little...

111
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,260
It's not so.

112
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,800
It's not your fault.

113
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,500
It's not because of you.

114
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,740
I should have received

115
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,380
his last phone call.

116
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,350
I should have answered it.

117
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,390
That it's okay... that I forgive everything...

118
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,290
That I love him, too...

119
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,200
I should have said it.

120
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,540
I couldn't say those words.

121
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,670
I was too busy hating him.

122
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,940
I couldn't say those words.

123
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,920
Just one day... No...

124
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,120
Just one hour... If I could have just one minute.

125
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,190
I want to talk to my father.

126
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,300
Now I can't do that.

127
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,970
I can't do it anymore.

128
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:24,480
Some words are said without talking.

129
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,890
I am sure he knew it all.

130
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,630
The Legend of the Blue Sea

131
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,350
Mortuary

132
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,620
Honey.

133
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,820
Why are you here, Honey?

134
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,590
Why are you?

135
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:14,170
- Mother.  - This is not possible. He told
me to come back home after my appointment.

136
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,700
You told me to get some fresh air.

137
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,810
You said, "See you later."

138
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,140
I shouldn't have gone out.

139
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,720
Honey!

140
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,020
I can't... If you leave like
this, how am I supposed to live?

141
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,660
No! This is unthinkable!

142
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,030
It can't be possible.

143
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,040
How could you, all by yourself...

144
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,510
- How can you leave me alone like this?!
- Please calm your mother down.

145
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,510
- It will be hard to go in the mortuary
like this. - No, Honey! No! You can't!

146
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,580
Honey!

147
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:08,450
- Mother! - It looks like she fainted
from shock. Let's move her to the ER.

148
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,060
Wow! It's a shame to watch it by myself.

149
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,270
She really has great talent.
She should've been an actress.

150
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,810
How did your father become
like that all of a sudden?

151
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,750
They are still examining the body.

152
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,490
We will know the result tomorrow morning.

153
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,830
That's why I told him to stop
drinking too much. And smoking, too.

154
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,030
He just didn't listen.

155
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,840
As one gets older,

156
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:05,280
I hear you forget recent memories and only
remember old memories. That's how I am already.

157
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,150
Old days seem like they were yesterday.

158
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:15,090
Your father didn't seem to be that way, though.

159
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,390
Did you meet Father?

160
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,560
Yes. About a month ago,
I saw him in this hospital accidentally.

161
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,100
He pretended not to know me.

162
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,470
Even though we locked eyes, he just passed me.

163
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,510
His gaze seemed to be of someone
who really forgot it all.

164
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,650
Your father is such a harsh person.

165
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,860
If I were to be born again,

166
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,430
I would like to be once more

167
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,830
my wife's husband and my son's father.

168
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,730
That's what I wish for.

169
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,300
It's probably my greed.

170
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,410
Father had such severe corneal
damage that he could hardly see.

171
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,150
What?

172
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,780
He didn't pretend not to see you.

173
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,860
He couldn't see you.

174
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,120
Yes, Attorney Lee.

175
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,290
Please submit the registration
of his death tomorrow.

176
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,720
I will send you the certificate
and other necessary documents.

177
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,990
Also, work on transferring the inheritance.

178
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,400
How long will it take?

179
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,860
It will take about a week.

180
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,500
That's too long. Finish it as soon as possible.

181
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,250
Mom is fine now.

182
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,880
I won't take medication,
so you don't need to get the prescription.

183
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,180
It was you, wasn't it?

184
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,550
What was?

185
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,590
Mother, you have to tell me.

186
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,990
I need to know so I can help.

187
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,440
That's right.

188
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,340
You are correct.

189
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,470
But...

190
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,780
Just in case, you don't know anything.

191
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,850
Emergency Medical Center

192
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,760
Mr. Jo Nam Doo?

193
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,680
Attention!

194
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,820
A new warrior?

195
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,420
I am called Park Moo.

196
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,030
I heard your skills are excellent.

197
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,430
Please assist my son well.

198
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:50,200
If one possesses a lot,
a lot of people will be after him.

199
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,660
Yes, but how do you know my name?

200
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,300
Can we talk a little?

201
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,070
I heard that Joon Jae is doing some strange work.

202
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,470
I was worried and looked into it a bit.

203
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,970
Oh, I see.

204
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,950
While I was doing it, I found out about you.
You are a bit different from Joon Jae.

205
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,220
Joon Jae scammed against hidden dirty money,

206
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,250
or illegal money, for which the victims
would be unable to report the scam.

207
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,360
But you didn't care about the source, Mr. Jo Nam Doo.

208
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,690
In other words,

209
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,200
- you commit all kinds of crime? - Yes.

210
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,370
I don't discriminate.

211
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:01,210
I eat all kinds of things and I do
all kinds of work. That's how it is.

212
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,610
So what?

213
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,310
As early as tomorrow. (using informal tone)

214
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:11,350
No, even today, I can put you in jail.
That's what I'm saying.

215
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,250
What will you do? (informal speech form)

216
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,620
Will you listen to me or
rot in jail for a few years?

217
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,330
Why are you speaking informally?
(using formal speech)

218
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,040
Please treat me kindly.

219
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,640
I am always on the side of
the one with a lot of money.

220
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,780
It looks like you will inherit all
your father's assets, Hyungnim.

221
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,150
If that's the case, there is no need
to threaten me so harshly like this.

222
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,290
I have more than enough reason to side with you.

223
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,790
What is it that you want?

224
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,330
- I'm going to get rid of Joon Jae.- To where?

225
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,630
Anywhere is fine. So he won't be anywhere.

226
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,940
Ah, actually,

227
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,840
there is something special that I really want.

228
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,080
If Joon Jae disappears,
I think it will be easier for me, too.

229
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,980
Ah, that's fine.

230
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,020
I was hesitating a bit because I felt a
bit close to him, but sure, let's do it.

231
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,530
This relationship was bound
to end sooner or later.

232
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,850
The cause of death is

233
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,430
sudden death caused by acute heart failure.

234
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,200
Sudden death? Not by poisoning?

235
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,310
If his death were caused by toxic poison,
his lips would have turned dark brown.

236
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,280
But in his case, his lips were bluish.

237
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,910
It's a typical symptom of cardiac arrest.

238
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,800
In addition, if it was due to toxic chemicals,
his death spots should have been black,

239
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,190
but it wasn't like that.

240
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,090
Based on his medical records, I believe it was
a natural death caused by acute heart failure.

241
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,530
If it was a strong poison like
cyanide, it could've been like that.

242
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,120
But it's my understanding that

243
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,840
the symptoms are different if the poison
was extracted from a natural substance,

244
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,660
like wolfsbane flowers.

245
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,630
On the surface, the symptoms are said to
be very similar to that of heart failure.

246
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,440
I want an autopsy done.

247
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,640
That way, we can reveal the real cause of death,

248
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,710
and find the cause of the corneal damage.

249
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,410
You want to kill your father twice?

250
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,680
Why?

251
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,120
Is there something that you
don't want to be found out?

252
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,760
That's not what I'm saying.
Joon Jae, for sending your father

253
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,530
alone like that makes me crazy.

254
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,830
I don't want him to be hacked
to pieces with a knife again.

255
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,970
What in the world do you want to
find out that you want an autopsy?

256
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,540
- The evidence that you killed my father. - Hey!

257
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,470
Don't do it, Chi Hyeon.

258
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,740
It's been ten years already, Joon Jae.

259
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,410
Over ten years, your father missed you so much,

260
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,820
but you never visited home.

261
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:37,060
I am curious as to why you are
being like this all of a sudden.

262
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,230
Is it because of money?

263
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,360
If it's for money, I'll give it all to you. So,

264
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,640
let's just send him peacefully.
He is your father, after all.

265
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,310
Let's not be so cruel like that.

266
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,640
With such perfect acting that
would even fool yourself,

267
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,680
you may have bewitched many people
and blinded my father's eyes.

268
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,720
That won't work anymore.

269
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,020
I am Heo Il Joong's only biological son.

270
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,720
The wolfsbane flowers
that were found in that house,

271
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,060
and micro-needles, and a large amount of
anticholinergic that belongs to Kang Seo Hee.

272
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,030
All those are incriminating evidence of
murder, so I am requesting an autopsy.

273
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,640
I am the oldest son of this household.

274
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,270
I am also the only son that father acknowledged.

275
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,080
Younger Brother ran away
from home ten years ago

276
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,140
and cut off the relationship with our father.

277
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,710
Because of the inheritance issue, there
was a big conflict with Father recently.

278
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,950
I and my mother do not want an autopsy.

279
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,320
Father would agree with that.

280
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,980
- This is a search and seizure warrant.
- Search the place!

281
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,590
Ah, isn't it a bit too early for funeral clothes?

282
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,730
The funeral will start soon.

283
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,630
If we do an autopsy,
you won't be able to do a funeral.

284
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,570
- I guess you are confident.
- Think whatever you want to think.

285
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,710
No matter what I say, you won't believe me anyway.

286
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,710
Do you know Kang Ji Hyeon by any chance?

287
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,020
And, from now on,

288
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,460
if there is anything else you'd like
to ask, please go through my lawyer.

289
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,230
Ah, lawyer...

290
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,660
I suppose you do have something
to say through your lawyer.

291
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,270
Of course you would. It's your twin sister's name.

292
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,670
It was really hard to obtain
this picture of your childhood.

293
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,410
You two really look alike.

294
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,410
So you are identical twins, right?

295
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,220
I don't know what you are trying to say.

296
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,190
Where is your sister now?

297
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,830
Or is that you?

298
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,840
I'm going crazy.

299
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,280
Hey, didn't anything come up?

300
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,050
As you can see.

301
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,750
Sunbae, do you think you were wrong this time?

302
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,060
No. It couldn't have escaped from this house.

303
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,730
There must be something in this house.

304
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,570
Honey, today is not red. It's black.

305
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,710
Why?

306
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,880
Chairman Heo... passed away.

307
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,310
What? How?

308
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,020
I don't know, either. I just heard about it now.

309
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,250
Oh, how is it turning now?

310
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,560
If he passes away so suddenly,
what will happen to our fate?

311
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,530
I heard CEO Heo left all his assets
to the adopted son and Kang Seo Hee.

312
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,860
That's what I heard.

313
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,870
But still, even though he had notarized his will,

314
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,100
I thought he would give it to his biological son.

315
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,340
That's right.
You could just change your will anyway.

316
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,210
But if he passed away so suddenly like this,

317
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,740
then they can't do anything about it.

318
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,210
Then did we line up on the wrong side?

319
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,320
It's beyond just lining up on the wrong side.

320
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,850
Ugh! To think what I did to that woman, Kang Seo Hee...

321
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,460
Oh my god! I will be put to death by dismemberment!

322
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,830
Can't you change the line even at this point?

323
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:12,030
How can a person be like that? As a person,
it's acceptable to change sides once.

324
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,870
But if you change twice,
that is just wrong as a person.

325
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,600
- I can't do that! - What do we do?

326
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,770
I don't know, either!

327
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,380
Hey, how can you come here?

328
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,790
What do you think? I'm getting people's
attention, and it will be awkward for you.

329
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,070
Joon Jae's father,

330
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,580
there were many reasons
why I couldn't forgive you.

331
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,020
But seeing the end of you is so sad.

332
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,850
Can you see me now?

333
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:13,690
Watch me well. I need to say farewell.

334
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:32,510
Like mother, like son.

335
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,120
Your son never came to visit his
father for over ten years, either.

336
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,590
Now that he is dead,
there is no better son than him.

337
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,690
It must all be because of money.

338
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,590
The petty reason you came here

339
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,330
is to try to find some crumbs to collect, isn't it?

340
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,470
If you'd just stayed still,
I would have given you something.

341
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,040
If you come out so noisily,

342
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,540
would I have the heart to
give you even a penny? Ouch!

343
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,210
Hey!

344
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,450
- Have you gone crazy?! - The ones who crawled
in to collect some crumbs are you and your son.

345
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:17,220
If you did that, you should have been
satisfied by leeching off of others.

346
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,160
Now a thief wants to act like an owner?

347
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,860
You are too greedy.

348
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,800
What? A thief?

349
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,610
- What is this? - Are you trying to hit her? I
don't think you are in the position to hit her.

350
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,410
What are you? Who are you to intervene?

351
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,210
You watch what you say.

352
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,320
Oh, is she someone you know? No wonder!

353
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,460
Let go! Won't you let go?

354
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,690
What are you doing now?

355
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,330
What I'm trying to do is...
There's something I'm curious about.

356
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,340
What is this?

357
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,290
Don't forget to take your medicine.

358
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,200
What's wrong, Cheong?

359
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,440
What did you just do?

360
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,880
I could have done everything,
but I didn't do anything

361
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,350
because you shouldn't forget
all the wrongs that you did.

362
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,120
I think you should remember them till the end.

363
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,190
You should remember all the
things that you coveted,

364
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,290
so you will be more tormented
for not obtaining them.

365
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,760
Let's go now.

366
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,460
- Get me some more side dishes. - I'm not a worker here.

367
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,390
Yes.

368
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,700
Omo, Madam.

369
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,600
- Madam, you must be so sad.- Omo, your face is gaunt.

370
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,610
- Despite all that Madam, you're so beautiful.
- Oh, I'm worried. Will you be alright?

371
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:26,180
Wow, how could anyone have so few principles?

372
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,820
They're lucky.

373
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,120
Ugh, why do I have to be so honest when it
comes to my own principles?! I'm insane.

374
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:40,230
Where's Unni Yoo Ran?
We're the odd ones out at this point.

375
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,400
Should I do something too?

376
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,310
- Did they find evidence? - Not yet.

377
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,280
- You're not going to the funeral hall? - I'm not going.

378
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,090
You should still go.

379
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:15,390
How could I? I still haven't
figured out how he passed away.

380
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,030
Do you have to do that?

381
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,630
What?

382
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,270
- The autopsy. - What?!

383
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,510
It's all in the past. Whatever is revealed

384
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,570
won't make your deceased
father come back to life.

385
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:35,010
We're just pointlessly poking at them at this
point. Instead, you should sweet talk them,

386
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:40,150
working it out to make sure that
you'll inherit something at least.

387
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,020
Even if it's someone else's business,
is that something you should be saying now?

388
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,460
I don't think I said anything I shouldn't have.

389
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,100
Think about it.

390
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,850
Heo Joon Jae.

391
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,320
I think I saw something.

392
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,100
You came to me to get caught up in a mess like this,
having to see bad things you don't need to see.

393
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,970
The fact that all those things
become your memories upsets me.

394
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,000
Even though I'm happy that I can
protect you with what I have?

395
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,310
You protect me?

396
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,810
Why, Heo Joon Jae? You think I can't?

397
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,230
It's true that I came up to the land
without knowing anything,

398
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,910
which made other people treat me like an idiot.

399
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,550
- But unlike what you see, I was totally
popular in the sea. - Is that so?

400
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:50,620
Of course! Unlike what you see,
I'm a mermaid of an endangered species.

401
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,220
Ahhh, these days you human beings with
your submarines and skin scuba,

402
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,530
whatever you call that, barge into
the ocean environment.

403
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,330
Do you realize how hard it is for mermaids
and mermen to stay hidden and survive?

404
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,600
Then sharks come whenever they want, saying,
"We'll bite and kill you." Our lives are hard too.

405
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,770
What do you do when a shark comes?

406
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,570
I can fight a shark and still win.

407
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:14,910
Wow, really? My girlfriend's the best!

408
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,220
You're smiling.
From now on, I'll keep making you smile.

409
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,660
"I'll protect you. I'll make you smile." These
are all things that the guy's supposed to say!

410
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,030
I'll protect you. I'll make you smile.

411
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,170
Dummy, saying all the things I'm supposed to say.

412
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,330
What should we do? We've made no progress.

413
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,370
It's here.

414
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,580
- Where are you going? - The basement?

415
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,880
I looked over there already.

416
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,200
She made a place like this. This never existed.

417
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,230
Forensics and I looked over this place, here.

418
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,140
It's there.

419
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,440
- These are wolfsbane (helmet) flowers.-
Don't touch those! Don't touch anything.

420
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,080
Whether it's a fingerprint or
anything else, it'll all come out.

421
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,360
What is that? Isn't that a mermaid?

422
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,690
Ma Dae Young. Ma Dae Young was here.

423
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,860
And Kang Seo Hee was Kang Ji Hyeon.

424
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:13,030
Joon Jae, thank goodness you came. You should be
here with your older brother as chief mourner.

425
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:18,230
I should. After I see you put in jail.

426
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,560
What?

427
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,430
From this moment, the unnatural death
case of the deceased, Heo Il Joong,

428
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,770
has been turned into a murder case.

429
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,480
The deceased will be

430
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,940
immediately transferred to
the National Forensic Service for an autopsy.

431
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,050
What did you say? With whose permission?

432
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:41,450
Kang Seo Hee, no, Kang Ji Hyeon, I'm arresting
you without a warrant as a murder suspect.

433
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,380
You have the right to remain silent and you have
the right to the attorney you like so much,

434
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,490
so do as you wish.

435
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,740
Do you have evidence? Do you have a warrant?!

436
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,640
Because there was so much evidence your mother
left at home, we were able to easily collect it.

437
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,610
And that's why we're arresting
her without a warrant.

438
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,120
Are you trying to say that I
killed my husband right now?

439
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,660
You should frame the right person.

440
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,760
If my husband heard, he'd be so upset.

441
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,970
Shut up! Don't speak my father's
name so easily with that mouth.

442
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,270
His words have weight.

443
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,140
What are you doing? Why are you
putting these kinds of things on me?!

444
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:42,380
Take them off! Can't you take them off?
Take them off!

445
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,420
You guys are making a mistake with me.

446
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,520
If you do this to an innocent
person do you think you'll be safe?!

447
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,090
Take them off!

448
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,530
Chi Hyeon! Contact the lawyer!

449
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:06,040
- Chi Hyeon! Call the lawyer, hurry! - Rascal.

450
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,210
Chi Hyeon.

451
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,870
Noona.

452
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,590
But did something happen?
Why is the atmosphere like this here?

453
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,540
How can such a thing like this happen?
Joon Jae must be so heartbroken.

454
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,910
How long has it been since he met his mother
that this kind of thing should happen?

455
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,090
Where's your car?

456
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,650
I took the bus.

457
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,590
Should I drop you off?

458
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,860
It's okay. Well, do you want to? It is late.

459
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,730
But you can't have other thoughts, okay?
It'll be burdensome to me then.

460
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,300
Hey, isn't this person insanely hot?

461
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,640
Hey, look. He's totally good-looking.

462
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,940
They're so loud.

463
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,330
♬ Why am I looking at her? ♬

464
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:47,030
♬ (Could it be love?) ♬

465
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:52,400
♬ Why do I smile when I see her?♬

466
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,510
♬ (Could it be love?) ♬

467
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,610
♬ It must be a dream ♬

468
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,750
What's he doing?

469
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,680
♬ It must be a dream ♬

470
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,490
He's won the lotto. He'd be so excited to
know that he's fallen asleep on my shoulder.

471
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:17,300
♬ Why am I like this? Just why am I? ♬

472
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:24,200
How can he be prettier than a girl?

473
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,270
Hey, did you see this?

474
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,780
This is daebak (awesome)!

475
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,640
Oh no, I have to get off here.

476
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,010
♬ Wake me up, oh me. ♬

477
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:41,450
♬ What kind of magic are you using on me? ♬

478
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:47,290
♬ How are you doing this to me? ♬

479
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,580
Sleep here.

480
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:19,060
Ma Dae Young may have lost his
memory but he remembers the mermaid.

481
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,860
I know, right.

482
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,560
Ma Dae Young seems to be
better than Dam Ryeong sometimes

483
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,600
when it comes to his thinking of the mermaid.

484
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:36,580
Se Hwa seems to speak so prettily. Her smile
is pretty and her actions are so demure.

485
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,710
I wonder if just because the face is
alike if the person could be the same?

486
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,250
Why are you like that, really?

487
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,630
But would everything really only be repeating
from the past life in the same way?

488
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,530
Why?

489
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:03,970
Truthfully, when I was erasing Ma Dae
Young's memory I saw another person's face.

490
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,770
Who?

491
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:11,010
The spear we were hit with when we died
wasn't one that Ma Dae Young threw.

492
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,280
What does that mean?

493
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:29,660
It was one that someone else threw.
I saw that person's face.

494
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,230
Who is it?

495
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,930
A person we know.

496
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,370
Looking at it, they only have circumstantial
evidence. They don't have direct evidence.

497
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,740
The poison tonic,

498
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,950
the evidence that you gave it to the chairman.

499
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:53,320
They're going to interrogate you with leading
questions. Only listen. Keep your answers short.

500
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,660
If they ask you unfavorable
questions, "I don't remember."

501
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,730
"My head hurts, I have a chronic disease."

502
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,790
You can use your right to remain silent.

503
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,460
Because they arrested you
emergently without a warrant,

504
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,670
they can only hold you for 48 hours.

505
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,610
Hurry up and tell us. If you don't
speak it will just go over as evidence.

506
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,180
I don't know.

507
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,980
Look here. You had this cup and these ten plates...

508
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:22,980
I don't know.

509
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,720
Why did you receive a prescription
for an anticholinergic?

510
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,020
My head hurts. No.

511
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,290
Using water infused with wolfsbane!

512
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,160
I don't know.

513
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,600
I have a panic disorder...

514
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,380
I'm telling you that I don't
remember and I don't know anything!

515
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,680
She's totally decided to hold out on
the "I have no recollection."

516
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,280
When there is this much evidence,
I thought she'd confess.

517
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,940
If she acknowledges it,

518
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,400
she becomes disqualified as a successor
and all that money disappears.

519
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,120
She probably would desperately endure it.

520
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,690
If she doesn't confess, it crosses over into
an investigation without detention, right?

521
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:21,540
It seems like he's leaving after
meeting with the detective.

522
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,080
Your mother will be released
at about 6 pm today, right?

523
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,920
Then, how would tonight be?

524
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,760
I don't think they'll stay like
this forever. We strike first.

525
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,890
I feel a bit urgent too.

526
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:55,940
Police: We Serve You with Devotion

527
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,640
Oh!

528
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,450
What?

529
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,250
It's Hyung Joon Jae.

530
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,380
What about Heo Joon Jae?

531
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,460
Is Jo Nam Doo crazy? Why is he like that?

532
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,230
Can't I go by myself? What if it's dangerous?

533
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:24,260
Tae Ho, there's something you don't know.

534
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,470
If we had an actual fight, you wouldn't
even be able to save your bones.

535
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:31,600
Just know that I'm way stronger than
you and hurry up and step on the gas.

536
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,970
Tie him tighter.

537
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:16,820
Hey, you bastard! How could you do this
to me? How could you do this to me?!

538
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,350
You were the one who fell for a woman

539
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:25,020
and stopped working with me.
You're the one who betrayed me, bastard!!

540
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,900
I have to make a living too. I'm sorry about this.

541
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,170
Untie me. Untie me, you bastard!

542
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,870
Oh, and this.

543
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,100
What's that?

544
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,670
Your suicide note. It will be
discovered in your room tomorrow.

545
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:47,610
You're going to commit suicide from the
guilt of having killed your father today.

546
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,350
What?

547
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,150
Don't do it.

548
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,120
Don't do it.

549
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,670
It's the component that
killed your father, Acrotine.

550
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:12,300
If it's fast, 10 minutes, if it's late, 30
minutes. You'll become comfortable (dead).

551
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,610
You crazy bastard.

552
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,510
Since you weren't able to receive
any inheritance from Father,

553
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,010
that's enough for the murder motive.

554
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,900
And... since you know the layout of our house well,

555
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,050
you concealed the evidence in the basement,

556
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,220
Joon Jae.

557
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,130
It wouldn't be hard to come up with a story.

558
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:45,370
- Chi Hyeon.  - Yes, Mother.

559
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:48,240
Will you wait outside with that person?

560
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,920
Do you think I'll leave you
alone according to your wishes?

561
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,960
If you don't, what are you going to do?

562
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,760
Dead men never tell tales.

563
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,400
Look at your father. He can't say anything.

564
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,580
How could you be like that to Father?

565
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,650
When Father was so good to you!

566
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:32,420
And wasn't I good?! It was 17 years.

567
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:39,190
I spent 17 years, acting like the tongue in
Heo Il Joong's mouth and I was very good.

568
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:48,370
But when it came time to bequeath his
fortune he only looked for his blood.

569
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,240
Is that why you killed him?

570
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,570
Yes. I killed him.

571
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:58,440
As it was, your father was dying anyway.

572
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:05,080
Truthfully, that poison, he hadn't been
ingesting it only for one or two days.

573
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:23,400
He was becoming addicted to it in
very small amounts so he didn't know.

574
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,070
It would have been hard for him to pass a year,

575
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:30,740
but with him saying he wanted
to draw up a will of all things,

576
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:36,380
I just sent him a bit early.

577
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:42,890
You killed your previous husbands like
that too, didn't you, Kang Ji Hyeon?

578
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:52,360
That's right. But no one knew
even after 20 years passed.

579
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:58,040
Perhaps, even after 20 years
passes no one will probably know

580
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,810
that I killed you and your father.

581
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,660
Would that really be?

582
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,580
Who set the alarm? I told you not
to do that during working hours.

583
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,340
Come out!

584
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,490
What is this?

585
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:51,220
What is this?! Who are you?!
Can't you let this go? Let go!

586
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,920
You! How dare you—

587
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:59,800
Look to see how many people put on such a
show to make you confess to your crimes.

588
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:06,840
Hey, this person has a panic disorder.
Hurry up and arrest her and lock her up

589
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,710
so she can be alone.

590
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:15,610
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

591
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:21,390
Hey! You, Heo Joon Jae! Let go of me!

592
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:34,670
Hey, a job came in from Heo Chi Hyeon.

593
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:40,470
Do I look like a betrayer-type?
Why does everyone (do this) to me?

594
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,640
Heo Chi Hyeon does see a person correctly.

595
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,210
So what did you say?

596
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,150
What do you mean, what did I say?
Of course, I said I'd do it.

597
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,950
You human being I can't trust.

598
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:55,950
Hey, it's like this. That side's
a successor and you're a beggar.

599
00:57:55,950 --> 00:58:00,090
Hey, you know my principle, right?
First, money. Second, even more money.

600
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:04,960
Then you should just take the money and do what
they ask. Why are you coming here to tell us this?

601
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,600
Sadly, the third principle doesn't fit.

602
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,740
The third? What's that?

603
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,000
Manners.

604
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,270
What?

605
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:18,480
I value manners. This jerk kept speaking
casually to me when he's even younger than I am.

606
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,980
I speak casually to you too.

607
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:24,780
You're the home owner. I have a respect
for the home owner. Respect, admiration.

608
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,750
So, did you tell him you wouldn't do it?

609
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,420
No, I told him I'd do it.

610
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,420
What are you trying to do?

611
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,130
We have to go hit him together.

612
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,860
- What? - The back of his head.

613
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:48,110
We're being wiretapped nearby. I'll
only speak to you through text messages.

614
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,180
Did any fingerprints come out yet?

615
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,280
Not yet.

616
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,550
You're not going to the funeral hall?

617
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,480
I'm not going.  [Act angry.]

618
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,550
But you should still go.

619
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:03,960
How could I? I still haven't
figured out how he passed away.

620
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,290
No. Be a little angrier!

621
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:07,660
Do you have to do that?

622
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,160
- What?  - The autopsy.

623
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,660
Even if it's someone else's business,
is that something you should be saying now?

624
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,500
That's right. You're doing well.

625
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,310
Let's get ready.

626
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,480
Okay.

627
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,060
I'll hit you in front of the car door.

628
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,110
Fall down, fall down.

629
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:02,740
Make it look realistic.

630
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:06,520
Does it make sense that if you get hit from the
back that you'd drip blood from there?

631
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,620
It really hurt earlier.

632
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,490
What? It's not even a real steel pipe. Why are you
making such a fuss about getting hit with it?

633
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:16,330
Hey, is it a right or a left at the coast?

634
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:18,400
Straight.

635
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,400
Hey, I lost it because of you! Damn it.

636
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:29,310
You! You! Heo Joon Jae! Can't you let go?!

637
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,230
Mother.

638
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,860
Chi Hyeon.

639
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,530
You bastard!

640
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,400
Chi Hyeon!

641
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,870
You can't!

642
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:04,110
- Work hard.  - You worked hard.

643
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:20,830
Hey! Hey!

644
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,230
Chi Hyeon!

645
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:25,660
Hurry up and get in.

646
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,340
Heo Joon Jae!

647
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,920
I saw that person's face.

648
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,120
Heo Chi Hyeon.

649
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:15,180
♬ Did I wake up from a long dream? ♬

650
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:19,480
♬ As soon as I recognized you ♬

651
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,360
♬ Before I knew you was the sky ♬

652
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:28,290
♬ always as brilliant? ♬

653
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:31,730
♬ If out of ten thousand chances ♬

654
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:36,940
♬ our love came into being ♬

655
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,870
♬ If out of ten thousand chances ♬

656
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,510
♬ you and I could begin ♬
