1
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,320
Just promise me one thing.

2
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,360
That you will not erase my memory as you leave.

3
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,830
Why?

4
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,800
You said this, too.

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,300
Rather than not being able to love
because you couldn't remember,

6
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,840
it's better to love, even if it hurts.

7
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,280
Because I have memories to share with you,

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,850
I can send you off.

9
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,350
Then you will be too pitiful.

10
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,220
I may never be able to come back.

11
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,920
Then you won't know if I'm dead or alive,

12
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,760
and you will have to continue to wait.

13
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,100
If you can never come back all my life,

14
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,470
I will be born again.

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,210
You do the same.

16
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,910
I already told you.

17
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,840
My love is

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,150
longer than my time.

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,490
I want you to be at ease.

20
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,920
If we remember each other,

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,430
we will not forget the way back. So,

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,830
we will eventually meet again.

23
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,340
Fine.

24
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,050
You choose then. Whether to erase

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,850
or to leave it as it is.

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,390
You choose.

27
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,170
I've made my decision.

28
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,650
Where are you going at this time?

29
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,420
What's going on? He told us to get
out briefly, and you two fought?

30
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,030
I'm going to have to go somewhere briefly.

31
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,630
Briefly to where?

32
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,870
Thank you for everything.

33
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,290
- Unni, that's a mink coat, isn't it?- Huh?

34
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,250
Omo, you recognized it? It's a new product.

35
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,990
- Unni, for being a pet lover...- What did you say?

36
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,230
In order to make that kind of coat, do you
know how many small and cute minks had to die?

37
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,730
While they were alive and in pain...

38
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,640
Well, isn't your thick
and unfashionable parka is

39
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,380
made out of down feathers?
Are you only sorry for the minks,

40
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,310
and you don't feel bad for the ducks inside
that parka? They don't get a shearing.

41
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,220
- One by one, they get plucked. Like this.
Plucked like this. Hmm? Hmm? - Ouch!

42
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,210
How much would it hurt? Like this, like this.

43
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,390
Doesn't it hurt? Doesn't it hurt?
You should date instead.

44
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,790
Ah, Unni! I can't talk with you, Unni!

45
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,330
Omo, what are you doing here?

46
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,270
- Isn't she that girl?
Heo Joon Jae's girlfriend?- She is.

47
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,880
She is not only Heo Joon Jae's girlfriend,

48
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,300
but also someone who received
unrequited love from another guy.

49
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,410
You must be happy, girl. Tae Oh's
cell phone is full of your pictures.

50
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,540
- Could you erase them?- Do you think I
would've left them alone? I've erased them.

51
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,980
- Good job.- I didn't do it to get complimented by you.

52
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,150
- But what are you doing here?

53
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,890
- I am going somewhere.
So I wanted to say goodbye to everyone.

54
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,360
- To where?- Where are you going?

55
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,890
I will miss all the food I ate here.

56
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,560
- Goodbye.- Goodbye.

57
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,860
Make sure to come back.

58
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,070
You are going to leave so soon, Unni?

59
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,170
- Do you still know me?- Why wouldn't I know?

60
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,480
Huh? You shouldn't know.

61
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,910
- It shouldn't be like that.- What is?

62
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,240
Something is strange about you.

63
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,620
The fact that you can hear
my voice that others can't hear, too.

64
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,160
- Why?- I saw you in my dream.

65
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,860
- Me?- Yes.

66
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,100
Help me.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,470
Help me.

68
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,740
And in that dream, you were a mermaid.

69
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,950
- And I was, too.- You were, too?- Yes.

70
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,490
In my dream, my father was a
fisherman and my mother was a mermaid.

71
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,750
Isn't it fascinating?

72
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,540
- Since I could communicate
with the mermaids in the ocean,

73
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,030
I could find out a lot of things.

74
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,130
You shouldn't go in the water on your boat today.

75
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,170
It looks like a big storm is on the way.
How do you know that?

76
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,940
- I just know it.- Let's listen to her.

77
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,310
Even the last time, she got it right like a ghost.

78
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,980
Thanks to her, we got saved many times.- That's
right. We almost got into a big trouble last time.

79
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,350
So? So, what happened?

80
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,390
In my dream, I think everything
is well and I was happy.

81
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,230
When I wake up from the dream,
I feel good all day long.

82
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,830
- That's a relief.- What is?

83
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,740
It must not be a folktale.

84
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,740
It must really have happened.

85
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,710
He said having memory is a way to return.

86
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,380
Our story that in this world only I can remember.

87
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,990
So that it won't be sad and it won't disappear,

88
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,260
I will protect it.

89
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,840
I will treasure it.

90
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,640
And I will return.

91
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,950
The Legend of the Blue Sea.Last Episode

92
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,320
Three years later

93
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,430
Come and eat.

94
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,770
Wow, it smells so great!

95
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,170
I can't leave this house because of you, Mother.

96
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,400
Please leave!

97
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,720
You keep saying you'd leave once
it gets warmer, and then once it gets cooler.

98
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,110
It's already been 3 years!

99
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,150
Go where? No need to get
out and waste money on rent.

100
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,280
You all stay here until you get married.

101
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,320
Mom!

102
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,550
Thank you, Mother. Hey, just let it be.

103
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,920
All my life I didn't have a chance to call
someone "Mother" and I'm finally saying that.

104
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,220
Me, too.

105
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,260
You, too, Tae Oh?

106
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,080
Hey, but why do we always
reserve this seat when we eat?

107
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,010
It's a habit.

108
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,120
Well, its true. But since we always
reserve this particular spot and eat,

109
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,690
it feels like there is a
specific owner of this seat.

110
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,320
Isn't it weird?

111
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,560
So many things are weird to you.

112
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:02,930
Prosecutors' Office

113
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,070
750Prosecutors Office

114
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,510
Who is it?

115
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,060
Ah, starting today, law students
are supposed to come in

116
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,940
for field experience at
the prosecutors' offices.

117
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,350
He must be assigned to our office, right?

118
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,350
Yes.

119
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm Heo Joon Jae. I put myself under your care.

120
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,820
This unni's son gave all his shares to her,

121
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,360
and graduated from college
that he took a break from.

122
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,500
Not only that, he went to the law
school to become a prosecutor.

123
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,230
- Omo, omo.- Oh, my world!

124
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,500
Also, this unni used half of her shares to
create a resting place for runaway teenagers.

125
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,210
She also established an alternative
school to public school.

126
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,180
- You are so amazing.- Isn't she?

127
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,680
It's nothing. My son ran away from
home when he was in high school.

128
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,950
I heard he suffered so much,
so that's why I thought of these.

129
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,120
But with that much shares,

130
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,520
you could've been CEO and more, Unni!

131
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,220
What do I know about that?

132
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,730
Those things need to be taken care of by others
who are knowledgeable. (Using informal speech)

133
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,860
Aww, this unni is so humble like this.

134
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,370
Watching this unni,
there's something that I realized.

135
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,900
You never know what's going to happen to your
life. Don't just look at your present situation.

136
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,770
Even if people don't change,
cir-cum-stan-ces do change.

137
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,940
That's right.

138
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,250
At any rate, thanks to this unni,

139
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,910
we were able to make really good investiments.

140
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,250
Ah, we have such a strongly intertwined fate.

141
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,760
Maybe we were like real sisters in the past life.

142
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,630
That's what I think.

143
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,900
Unni, are you out of coffee? Should I refill it?

144
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,430
No, I'll do it.

145
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,130
Oh, Unni! Why do you keep doing that?

146
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,300
I need to serve you! Just stay seated. Oh, right!

147
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,110
You liked Apple-Mango.
Would you like some more Apple-Mango?

148
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,980
Would you, then?

149
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,650
Just wait.

150
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,920
Okay, who should go eat first?

151
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,050
Why don't you go first and eat?

152
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,260
Intern. Should we go eat first?

153
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,060
Why would there be eating
separately and not together?

154
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,370
Intern, what do you think is the
most important thing to a prosecutor?

155
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,270
None other than... sense of justice?

156
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,140
That's important, too. That's important, but
there's something more important than that.

157
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,280
That we never leave our office empty.

158
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,550
Pardon? Why not?

159
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,520
Well, a while back...

160
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,260
we were robbed by con-artists.

161
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,160
But how?

162
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,860
So, it happened when we all
went out to eat lunch together.

163
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,030
Has it been about 3 years?

164
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,000
That's right.

165
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,140
These jerks sat on my seat,

166
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,650
and pretended to be prosecutors and met
clients! They erased all the CCTV recordings.

167
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,160
Wow, for real?

168
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,090
Oh, look at my goosebumps.

169
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,360
How could they even think of such things?

170
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,130
There are so many psychos in this world.

171
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,870
Had I come just 5 minutes earlier,
I could have caught those jerks.

172
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,110
- But because there was a problem
with the traffic signal...- Aigo!

173
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,180
What a shame.

174
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,240
They came in, saying they are
changing that water filter.

175
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,480
Wasn't it to fix the elevator?

176
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,050
Oh, that's right! To fix the elevator.

177
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,850
How did you know?

178
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,290
I hear such things happen frequently
in Seocho-gu, Gangnam area.

179
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,230
Oh, really?

180
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:28,200
At any rate, I normally don't trust people easily,
and since then, I trust people even less.

181
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,110
In this world, there are all kinds of people.

182
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,780
Aish, those jerks!
I will catch all those bastards!

183
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,850
They say that the damage was about
5,000,000 won ($5,000) per person.

184
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,690
Prosecutor, this is not a con.

185
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,860
Wouldn't it be something that could happen
easily during a business transaction?

186
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,260
That's why no charges were
sent even from the police.

187
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,000
But is the business address
listed here a residence?

188
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,400
Excuse me?

189
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,470
- Oh, that is...- It's the same for the branch offices.

190
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,740
Seeing that they applied for
delayed payment of Value-Added Tax,

191
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,610
their financial state isn't good.

192
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,910
That's right. I told you that sometimes they
have difficulties when doing a business.

193
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,450
But that's not conning.

194
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:20,550
Also, we never told those people
that we guarantee the principal.

195
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,620
Distribution of compensation, annuitization,

196
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,520
including price of goods in the payment.

197
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,760
Don't all these imply that principal
is guaranteed? Isn't that right?

198
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,900
This proves to be the financial
transaction without trading goods.

199
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,400
If it was normal transaction, there is no reason
to include the price of goods into extra pay.

200
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,820
Both price of goods and extra pay are
money that a seller should receive.

201
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,210
But if those two are included,

202
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,580
then you are telling them to
give and receive by themselves?

203
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,980
This person, President Choi, does he
still do money laundering in Macao?

204
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,150
He is still gambling, right?
I know how much he lost recently.

205
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:02,930
This is not a case of 10 victims with $5,000 each,
but 10 to the 10, and then 10 to those 10...

206
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:08,000
It looks to be case worth of 10 billion won
(10M USD), that involves at least 3,000 people.

207
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,340
Do you really have a connection there?

208
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,980
No, I just overheard it somewhere.

209
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,480
That's not it. It doesn't seem like it.

210
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,590
- I'll see you tomorrow!  -Please go home safely.

211
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,900
What is he?

212
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,940
How did you know to come? You didn't
even contact me, saying you were busy.

213
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,310
Do you contact me? Did you? Is it hard to
study? It looks like you lost some weight.

214
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,650
Of course, studying is hard. Did you
think I do it because it's fun and easy?

215
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,020
I'm glad you set your heart right. You were out
of your mind for a while and saying crazy things.

216
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,390
You'd disappear and cover your track.
I was honestly scared at that time.

217
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,200
What you went through isn't something
people can handle with normal mentality.

218
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,770
I thought maybe you turned weird.

219
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,640
I can barely remember now.

220
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,510
Even when I try to remember that
time, I can't remember well.

221
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,050
What does Jo Nam Doo do these days?

222
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,220
Special lecture. Is it evading the law or
legitimate? You are not evading the law.

223
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,520
Hi, I'm the star lecturer who will be lecturing
about "Evading the law or Legitimate Law~."

224
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,560
There is this evasive and
mysterious borderline

225
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,490
between evasion and legitimacy of the law.

226
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,030
This is the time to learn the true wisdom of life.

227
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,300
The first theme is our attitude towards tax.

228
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,440
This is a bit ambiguous area,
so I don't normally handle this.

229
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,360
But today, since we only have
VIPs of department stores,

230
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,410
I will delve into it specially and teach you.

231
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,440
Instead, you may not do voice
or video recording of it.

232
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,520
You should hear and write it. Where? In your heart.

233
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,160
Benjamin Franklin said this, "In this
world nothing can be said to be certain,"

234
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,690
"except death and taxes."

235
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,400
This Jo Nam Doo wants to tell Benjamin this.

236
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,570
Oh, that's right. One can't avoid
death, but I can avoid tax.

237
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,100
Do you want to know how?

238
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:34,210
What is it? Have you started without me?
Give me a blood sausage soup for me.

239
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,780
Aren't you conning people
in the name of lecturing?

240
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,120
Am I crazy? I'd rather quit instead
of being caught by him later.

241
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,990
Im having a hell of a time using
my mouth instead of my hands.

242
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,560
Truly, I thought it was a joke that he
suddenly wanted to become a civil servant.

243
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,970
Who would have known he would really go
to law school to become a prosecutor?

244
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,170
They say birds of a feather flock
together, so isn't it thanks to me?

245
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,340
Once Heo Joon Jae met me,
he recognized a good person!

246
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,850
I should live like him. If I lived like Jo Nam Doo,
I'd ruin my life. I'm sure he had many thoughts.

247
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,090
Then he was able to decide so. That's how I see it.

248
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,790
You're wrong.

249
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,560
What is it really that you decided to
be a cvil servant, all of a sudden?

250
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,670
On top of that you've decided to become
a high-ranking public official as a prosecutor.

251
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,000
What an extreme decision.

252
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,510
Well, presumably there was a triggering factor...

253
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,080
But I cannot remember well.

254
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,220
Let's drink well, Detective.

255
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,690
Please order a boiled meat.

256
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,630
Here, an order of boiled meat, please.
You are eating a lot today.

257
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,030
And, you Tae Ho, Dude, you',
Buster, cleaned up, too, right?

258
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,300
How many times are you repeating?
Tae Ho now is a white- hacker.

259
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,740
Bug bounty? He is doing something like that.

260
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,270
Wha.. What is that?

261
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,110
By performing mock attacks to see
if companies are hackable or not,

262
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,950
and strengthening their
security systems, something like that.

263
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,680
Do you even get it when I explain?

264
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,350
Ignorant..

265
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,160
I'm not quite sure, but don't do silly stuff.

266
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
What's he saying...

267
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,760
Uh, where did I put my phone?

268
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,800
Ah, he has started again.

269
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,540
Can't you control it?

270
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,670
Check things out if something's missing or not.

271
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,610
Uh, hey!

272
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,520
WOW, this kid... is this his hobby?

273
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,060
Ah, Soo Jeong, it's me, Oppa. Are you sleeping?

274
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:05,830
When will it end? Uh, working late?

275
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,370
Where are you headed?

276
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,140
What's up?

277
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:19,040
Don't leave! Today, no one leaves.

278
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,720
What do you mean?
I need to go now so I can work tomorrow.

279
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,650
Nope! Can't leave! Leave after the sunrise!

280
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,560
What's wrong with this guy.

281
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,760
Sleeping?

282
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:42,230
Ah, with your husband? You're married! I am sorry.

283
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,040
Hew!

284
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,910
Hey, what's wrong with him?

285
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,450
What's wrong with him now?

286
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,050
Miss her!

287
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,550
Whom?

288
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,290
Miss her!

289
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,630
Ah! What a sobering! He has developed
a new weird habit, detective.

290
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,640
He used to just stopped people from leaving

291
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,800
and repeated himself over
and over when he got drunk.

292
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,940
But now he cries!
He won't even remember it next day!

293
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,610
I miss her!

294
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,380
Then, whom? Let me know who it is, punk!

295
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,010
Who do you miss so much every time you drink?

296
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,150
Ah!

297
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,660
He became truly weird after that event.

298
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,600
He locks himself in the room and stay there...

299
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,570
and goes to the sea to see sunrise,

300
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,010
and again goes for sunset, when it's time for.

301
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,150
But when I ask him why he is doing that,
he says, he doesn't know why he does that.

302
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,370
I'm leaving it here. I've done my job delivering!

303
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,930
You can continue. Do continue, yes.

304
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,210
Totally good!

305
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,160
It's a tour bus!

306
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:13,830
The smell of emissions! The group of anchovies
are still the same. I feel at home!

307
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,810
When did that building got completed?

308
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,950
Time passes...

309
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,820
Wait a minute,
where is the jewelry shop around here?

310
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,820
Bye now.

311
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,670
Where are you from?

312
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,010
Who are you?

313
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,180
Which sea are you from?

314
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,410
How did you know?

315
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,280
Kid! Answer me, I am the one asked you the question.

316
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,360
From Jeju Island. Back and forth
between Jeju and Woo Islands.

317
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,620
But then, what are you doing here?

318
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,530
Hungry?

319
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,560
Will you come in?

320
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:34,250
You'll be treated as an idiot
if you eat like that here.

321
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,310
Look at me carefully.

322
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,930
Ah, I saw this a few times.

323
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,030
But what are you here for?

324
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,300
I miss one person.

325
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,770
Occasionally, I went to the Ju-Mun area to play.

326
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,170
and met a man who told me he lives in Seoul, so..

327
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,380
I swam for 15 days and came up all the way here.

328
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,350
Did he tell you to come? Did he say he loves you?

329
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,420
Did he ask you to marry him?

330
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,850
He didn't exactly say so.

331
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,320
Ah, I feel frustrated.

332
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,430
What are you doing, just coming up
to the land without any confirmation?

333
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:26,730
Uh, this kid has no plan, really. Listen well.

334
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:32,540
The moment a mermaid comes up to the land
leaving water, your heart starts to harden.

335
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,040
Truly?

336
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:40,580
Yes. Your heart automatically beats in
the water, but not out of the water!

337
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,420
There is only one way for you to continue
to breathe and for your heart to beat!

338
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:50,790
The man you love will love you back.
That's the only way!

339
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,400
But would it be possible with that man?

340
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,170
Once, I meet him, it may work out, but..

341
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,340
He doesn't answer my calls.

342
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,070
I'm unable to meet him.

343
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,170
Fine. Have a dishful of sashimi and

344
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,280
hurry back to water thinking
you had a good experience.

345
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,850
But then, have you met such a man?

346
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:20,050
Of course, I've met one. I met one
very handsome fool who only loves me.

347
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,590
Therefore, my heart was beating well.

348
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,660
If so, why did you go back to the sea?

349
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,560
No matter how well my heat was beating,
it was no good in front of a gun.

350
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,930
Did you get shot?

351
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,870
Now that I got shot, I understand now.

352
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,640
How the sharks and dolphins
are killed at one shot!

353
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,170
Oh, don't even speak if you
haven't been shot by a gun.

354
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:47,210
I had to go deep in the sea to recuperate
taking all kinds of nutritious things...

355
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,750
I've worked hard at recuperation for a long time.

356
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,850
What's the reason for the gunshot?

357
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,020
I wanted to protect that man.

358
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,630
So I saved him. I don't regret it.

359
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,330
Where is he? Does he know you returned?

360
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,170
Ah, it's cold.

361
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,940
Who is it?

362
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,380
I've asked you who you are?

363
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,780
I have something important to say...

364
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,180
Ah, I do have a religion.

365
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,490
Ah! I'm cold, what is it?

366
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,330
If not a religion, what, milk? A water
purifier? Newspaper? If not, what is it?

367
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:17,440
No, none at all. By the way, could Heo Joon Jae be in?

368
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,810
Forget about him.

369
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,010
- What?- I said to forget him.

370
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,880
I'm not sure how you find this place,

371
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,720
but Joon Jae fooled you.

372
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,750
What about...

373
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,850
The kid was on you to go see the sunrise
in the east sea on January 1st., right?

374
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,000
Then, he returned after just looking at the sea.

375
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,820
After he discontinued all
means of communications?

376
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,060
He may seem quite cool.

377
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,060
That's his trick. Just think of it as unfortunate.

378
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,970
I felt you look familiar and feel like
my sister so I'm giving you some advice.

379
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,810
Who are you?

380
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,440
Ah, Mother. This lady came looking for Joon Jae.

381
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,650
I'm trying to convince her to leave nicely.

382
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,750
A guest of Joon Jae came. Don't be rude.

383
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,620
Go in and wait for him.

384
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,720
Can I use your bathroom, please.

385
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,860
Ah... the restroom is...

386
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,430
She appears as comfortable in
this house as if it were her own.

387
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,230
Is that so?

388
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,210
Joon Jae brought her in when we were
away, ah this kid!

389
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,350
Who?

390
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:13,420
Ah, I'm not sure.
It's a woman with long hair and pretty!

391
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,920
She sure is your type!

392
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,130
I haven't exchanged names, yet.
You aren't in trouble are you?

393
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,900
Oh, get here soon.

394
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,770
What is your name?

395
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,510
It's Cheong, Sim Cheog.

396
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,110
Don't joke around.

397
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,310
It's real. My name is Sim Cheong.

398
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,150
Ah, your parents must have loved fairy tales.

399
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,880
Where is your home?

400
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,020
Far.

401
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,190
Mine's far, too.

402
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,290
Isn't yours Namyang-ju?

403
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,190
Right. How did you know?

404
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,770
What's this? A real? A real jade?

405
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,210
Why do you laugh?

406
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:14,210
I think people don't change much.
I like it that way.

407
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,860
Cha Si Ah.

408
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,430
Mother, I'm here.

409
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,600
Who?

410
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,370
Ah, so it is.

411
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,710
He isn't here yet.

412
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,240
Uh, you..

413
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,750
do you have to be one one to propose first?

414
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,580
What about it? Women do it more nowadays.

415
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,820
But, it might be wait to wait for the man to do it.

416
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,060
Does she stay here?

417
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,630
How come? Do you have something to say to me?

418
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,230
Are you getting married?

419
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,670
Ah, yes.

420
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,000
With whom?

421
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,440
A man who lives in this house.

422
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,810
There are three men, which one among them?

423
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,440
How do you know there are three men living
in this house? Did Joon Jae tell you?

424
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,480
- To whom are you getting married, Cha Si Ah?- Huh? Omo!

425
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,880
How did know my name?
I don't think I introduce myself yet.

426
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,250
By chance, are you getting
married to Heo Joon Jae?

427
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,320
What if I do?

428
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,960
- Is she Joon Jae's fan as well?- That's how it looks.

429
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,030
Give it up! You won't be able to get him.

430
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,400
You know that a woman against whom you can never
win is a woman inside someone's memory, right?

431
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,740
He has an incredible woman in his memories.
You can never win.

432
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,280
- For your information, the man I'll marry
is- - If it's not Heo Joon Jae, it's fine.

433
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,790
What's this bitter taste...?

434
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:09,630
So...wait till a man proposes...

435
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,900
He could be preparing for it himself.

436
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,890
Joon Jae, you have a guest.

437
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,110
Who are you?

438
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,080
You became even more dashing, Heo Joon Jae.

439
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,150
I'm glad you look well.

440
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,050
I'm asking who you are?

441
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,450
I am... I am..

442
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:14,160
the one you said you'd love
longer than your lifetime.

443
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,860
How come she doesn't say a word?

444
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,830
Ah.. He doesn't even remember. Oh no, too bad.

445
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,870
What brings you here?

446
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,610
That is just...

447
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:35,810
I'm okay now. I wanted to let
you know that I'm healthy.

448
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,920
And because I missed you.

449
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,460
Do you know me?

450
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,190
Yes, I know you better than
anyone else in the world.

451
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:54,770
No, it's not that I know you so well.

452
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:02,740
We just brushed each other
briefly, very briefly.

453
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,980
I don't know if you you would
remember, Mr. Heo Joon Jae.

454
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,480
Is that so?

455
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,720
But did you come here because
you have something to say?

456
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,660
I love you.

457
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,830
No.

458
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,200
Just...

459
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,570
I love you.

460
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,610
There isn't anything else I want to say.

461
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,680
It looks like you are doing well, so that's good.

462
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,290
I love you, Heo Joon Jae.

463
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,260
I see.

464
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,600
But what should we do?
I have an appointment near by.

465
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,130
I was just stopping by to leave the
car at home, so I need to leave again.

466
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,070
Yes.

467
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:07,110
No, Joon Jae, I'm going to propose to
Tae Oh and announce our marriage today.

468
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,110
Where are you going?

469
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:14,410
I'm sorry. Do it on your own.
Congratulations, Choi Si Ah.

470
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,650
Joon Jae, how can you just leave your guest here?

471
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,590
Excuse me.

472
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,060
Goodbye, everyone.

473
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,740
What is this? He just left. Where did he go?

474
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:54,190
♬ The door to a new world is open. ♬

475
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,520
♬ It is within you. ♬

476
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:08,600
♬ When I enter my eyes are dazzled ♬

477
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:18,010
♬ A wide world welcomes me. ♬

478
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,480
Wait here just a bit. Don't leave.

479
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,950
♬ I approach you. ♬

480
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,820
Heo Joon Jae, hurry back.

481
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,960
♬ I want to stay ♬

482
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,730
♬ in that world which is you ♬

483
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:38,300
♬ I owe you I miss you ♬

484
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,140
♬ I need you I love you ♬

485
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,070
♬ Eternally in your arms ♬

486
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:53,980
You look comfortable and happy the way
you are. Should I not have come back?

487
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,440
Why? So you can leave again?

488
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:27,480
♬ Will you come to me and take my hand ♬

489
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:34,520
♬ I will love you even if the world changes. ♬

490
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,220
♬ I owe you I miss you ♬

491
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,560
♬ I need you I love you ♬

492
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,000
Was this what you wanted?

493
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,300
To be erased from the world completely.

494
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,170
So that even I would forget you?

495
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:59,280
If it was going to be like this, why did
you erase them? I told you not to do it.

496
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Do you really remember?

497
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,050
Yes.

498
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,260
In this world, only I remember you.

499
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,360
How?

500
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:23,670
Silly girl. Erase them 100
times, and see if I forget you.

501
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,610
No, it can't be. It can't be.

502
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,780
There is something you missed.

503
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:46,260
Where we went, what we did,
what we ate, what you said,

504
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,130
when you laughed, how pretty you were...

505
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:59,200
You may have been able to erase those kind of
things, but you could not erase you from me.

506
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:06,850
You are just remembered by my
body and engraved in my heart,

507
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,980
so there was nothing you could do.

508
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,990
Even so, I worked hard at it.

509
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:24,760
Just in case, after many years have
passed, what if I really forget you.

510
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:33,610
That's why every day I tried
really hard not to forget you.

511
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,490
I've recorded everything.

512
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,830
Long before you left.

513
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,100
In case something like
this happens in the future,

514
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,600
and all my memories are gone,

515
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,170
I could at least find you in my record.

516
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:11,580
♬ may have started♬

517
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:20,250
♬ Before I knew you was the sky♬

518
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:29,130
♬ always as brilliant as this?♬

519
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:37,840
♬ If out of ten thousand chances
our love came into being♬

520
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,370
♬ If out of ten thousand chances you and I...♬

521
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:47,680
And after you disappeared, the puzzles
of memory that started to fade,

522
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,350
I was able to hold onto them for a year.

523
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,390
♬ the love which may not end ♬

524
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:59,190
♬ for you ♬

525
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:06,730
♬ All of my moments are for you♬

526
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:19,610
♬ With you I see and hear more♬

527
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:23,950
♬ Breathing with you will be everything♬

528
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,420
♬ Because I am happy doing without♬

529
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,720
♬ I want to stay with you♬

530
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,160
It took another year to find the
sea that you might be staying in.

531
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,500
♬ The time before I knew you was blurry♬

532
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:50,240
♬ I don't remember everything ♬

533
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,310
This house is too far from the sea.&lt;

534
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,880
I want the road to be connected like this.

535
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,820
How about this one?

536
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,890
This house is too big.

537
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,660
Ah, this one is too small.

538
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,800
There are too many people around there.

539
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,100
Ah, there aren't too much foot traffic here.

540
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:22,440
I spent the last year preparing a house
near the sea where I can live with you,

541
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:27,610
♬  all for you ♬

542
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,120
Who?

543
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,220
I don't know. It's some woman.
She has long hair and she is pretty.

544
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,290
She seems to be your style.

545
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:40,730
I haven't got her name yet.
You didn't get into some trouble, right?

546
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,030
Oh, okay. Come quickly.

547
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,840
After making me suffer so much.

548
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,270
Finally!

549
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:04,980
♬ If I were allowed just one day♬

550
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,760
♬ Just one day ♬

551
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,460
That's how three years have passed.

552
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,460
And the day that seemed like it
would never come, came today.

553
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,300
♬ I would use the unforgettable today and♬

554
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,730
♬ the unchanging memories♬

555
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:31,940
♬ and all of the love I have♬

556
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,520
Hey Joon Jae, someone's here to see you.

557
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,830
♬ will be for you.♬

558
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:56,500
♬ Until my last breath all for you.♬

559
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:12,550
Why did you do that?
I really may not have been able to come.

560
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,320
What were you going to do then?

561
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,930
Then I alone would have remembered you
for the rest of my life on this Earth.

562
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,160
I alone loving you.

563
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,770
Everything is as it was.
The lease must have expired.

564
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:10,410
It has passed of course, since the person
who would helpwith the move hasn't come.

565
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:13,050
So I just bought it out right.

566
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,450
Thank you for waiting for me.

567
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:23,620
You worked hard not giving up and
coming back on such a long journey.

568
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,840
You aren't going to erase it
yet again this time, right?

569
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,610
It's not like my memory is the kind that would
be erased, should you try a hundred times,

570
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:44,040
even so, what's difficult is difficult.

571
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,550
I won't. I won't.

572
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,050
Never mind. I take back what I said.
I stuck a foot in my mouth.

573
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:54,750
This right here can be erased, I think.

574
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:59,190
How come? Come here.

575
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,090
Startled me!

576
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:36,760
What are you looking for?

577
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,360
This side has better clothing, and...

578
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,830
That side has better shoes, right?

579
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:46,370
You know it well, it seems. But you appear already
well dressed, so what have you come to find?

580
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:47,940
Came to find you.

581
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,570
- Me?- Yep.

582
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,910
I missed you.

583
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:56,850
As for me, I didn't miss you,
as this is our first encounter.

584
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,750
Even though this is our first encounter
and a coincidence,here's what I think.

585
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,650
life is full of coincidental connections.

586
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,020
You should cherish these connections

587
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,920
and these good connections
will continue to be created.

588
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:11,660
I'm very shy with strangers, but your
philosophy is compatible with mine.

589
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,200
Yea, let's be friendly with
each other in the future.

590
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,570
Sure, let's do that, then I will be here...

591
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,440
I know, you come here Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays. I will come accordingly.

592
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,340
Are you a stalker by any chance?
Are you following me?

593
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,240
No. I have a man I love.

594
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,710
Ah, you're in a relationship.

595
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,680
Which stage? In love-

596
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,020
There are three levels: romantic, hot and dirty.

597
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,190
How did you..?

598
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:41,160
I think right now it's not
romantic but it's becoming hot.

599
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,230
You can say that it's a phase that can be
progressed tothe dirty phase in near future.

600
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:49,570
Are we some sort of soulmates?

601
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,140
We totally get each other.

602
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,610
Let's get together often.

603
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,860
Winter nights are not short, Honey.

604
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,530
High School Equivalence Diploma
(General Education Diploma)

605
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:22,000
What are you doing? You know I have to take the GED?

606
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,140
Then, do it in the bed, in the bed!

607
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,240
What's so hard about it? I'll teach you everything.

608
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,440
There's nothing among what mankind can do
that's difficult for me or that I cannot do.

609
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,350
Then what is the problem, huh?

610
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:46,590
♬Unusually bright sunshine♬

611
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,560
♬Warm wind embraces us♬

612
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:56,070
♬Walking with you in this beautiful day♬

613
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:00,770
♬My heart's beating like crazy♬

614
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:05,240
♬You keep saying weird things♬

615
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:10,250
♬Asking silly questions♬

616
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:15,050
♬The whole world knows how I feel♬

617
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:19,320
♬How come you don't know?♬

618
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:24,230
♬I love you, silly♬

619
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,430
Final prosecutor selection interview

620
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,270
Mr. Heo Joon Jae, in addition to the legal
discussion review (Law review) record,

621
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:34,810
has the outstanding bar exam score.

622
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:39,240
Do you happen to have a specific focus on
what type of prosecutor you'd like to be?

623
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:44,550
Yes. My dream is to become a public
prosecutor at a regional branch.

624
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:49,590
In a scenic place.
If it's near the ocean, even better.

625
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:54,760
For instance, few years ago I
bought a small house in Sok Cho area

626
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,530
if I can carry out my first duty
there, it'll be icing on the cake.

627
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:01,930
♬Makes my lips dry♬

628
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,710
♬I love you, silly♬

629
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,040
♬Oh, beautiful day.♬

630
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,480
♬You looked at me and gave me a big smile♬

631
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,520
♬I smiled back at you♬

632
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,880
♬You know, silly, ♬

633
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,850
♬Were you like me?♬

634
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:26,890
♬My heart thump, keeps on thump♬

635
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:31,360
♬My heart keeps on telling you♬

636
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,470
♬I love you, I love you♬

637
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,370
♬You are my girl♬

638
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:42,240
Finally we made our dream come true.

639
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,280
In a village where not much
exists, not much news occurs,

640
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,350
in a small boring village, with nothing special

641
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:58,490
having a very, very simple life.

642
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,360
Aren't you having too much food?

643
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,000
Are you seeing it as I'm eating them?

644
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,600
Then?

645
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,070
Sorry, sorry.

646
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:15,440
You were so slim, I keep forgetting.

647
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,080
Eat, eat. Eat them all!
You need to eat all of these, too.

648
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,780
Totally happy!

649
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:26,790
How can I support two people as a government
officer? There will be huge expenses for food.

650
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,690
Don't you worry, honey!

651
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:33,060
I will try very hard to cry
until the tears will dry off.

652
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:38,260
Sure, honey. You don't seem
to cry nowadays. Try more.

653
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,130
Don't you worry.

654
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:44,600
While crying and laughing
at very simple things,

655
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,670
being happy, and being sad...

656
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:54,070
While watching quietly how
our time together flow, each day, each hour,...

657
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:57,110
each minute and each second...

658
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,670
After making many detours,

659
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:26,950
treasuring the love that finally came to me...

660
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:52,000
As we remember our legend that's far
off, beautiful and secretive...

661
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:29,170
Thanks to Seul-Gi Kim for the cameo part.
