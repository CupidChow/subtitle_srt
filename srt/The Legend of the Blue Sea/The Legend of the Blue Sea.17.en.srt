1
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,360
Se Hwa!

2
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,150
Those two live well.

3
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,890
They don't get sick or hurt.

4
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,900
They bear many pretty babies
and while raising them well,

5
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,200
live a long, long time, happily

6
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,300
growing old together.

7
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,110
Lies again.

8
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,750
It was all lies again.

9
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,720
Who are you?

10
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,270
And where are we?

11
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,070
Why am I here?

12
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,410
I saw the people you killed.

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,710
I heard their screams.

14
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,510
What are you saying?

15
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,750
Who are you saying I killed?

16
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,820
Who are they?

17
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,520
People who were born with blessings
and grew up as someone's family,

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,860
people who were to have met the
ones they were to fall in love with,

19
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,060
the people who would have dreamt about the
future they would have grown old in together.

20
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,730
You brutally ended the future of those people

21
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,130
in one instant.

22
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,970
I don't know anything.

23
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,640
I'll end it also.

24
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,040
I'll make your life into a blank page also

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,710
so that you can't remember anything

26
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,050
so that you can't be forgiven.

27
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,790
Legend of the Blue Sea.

28
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,860
Oh, really!

29
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,630
Let's be careful.

30
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,400
Ma. Ma Dae Young?

31
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,380
This is 112, right? I just saw Ma Dae Young.

32
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,320
The fugitive!

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,620
For the last time, I'll tell—

34
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,490
No, I'll ask you.

35
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,130
Please, believe what I say.

36
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,700
Believe what I say for once and leave
from here together with me for now.

37
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,170
I'm not leaving.

38
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,100
What's wrong with you? How could you be so loud?

39
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,710
Yes, the installation is complete.

40
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,140
For a short time,
you might actually see more bugs.

41
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,980
Don't worry because the treated
ones will be the ones coming out.

42
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,150
Yes, we'll see you at the next
scheduled maintenance. Have a nice day.

43
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,640
Episode 17

44
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,210
Why don't you keep talking
about what you were saying?

45
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,050
If you suddenly become quiet,
it seems as if you were talking about me.

46
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,450
We didn't say much. It's been a long time.

47
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,090
Why haven't you come out to our meetings lately?

48
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,560
Come sit over here.

49
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,300
She didn't come yet?

50
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,130
No.

51
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,340
Oh. Kang Seo Hee is here too.

52
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,710
Kang Seo Hee? (Surprised that she dares to call
her by name and not a more respectful title)

53
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,040
It's correct that you're Kang Seo Hee.

54
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,950
Oh, but who invited you today?

55
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,650
I purposefully didn't today for
fear you might feel uncomfortable.

56
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,620
That's why I didn't invite you.

57
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,360
Why? Why would I feel uncomfortable?

58
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,930
What did you want to say?

59
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,100
Rather than something I was going to say...

60
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,340
Unni, come in.

61
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,140
Heo Joon Jae, I really liked it here.

62
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,570
It was my first home.

63
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,970
Come on inside.

64
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,380
Oh my goodness. Oh my word!

65
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,980
Give and take.

66
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,050
When you're alone,

67
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,750
When you're alone... do what you want to, you must.

68
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,920
No matter how cold it is outside, that
there's a warm place for me to return to,

69
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,130
to talk to you, laugh with, have fun with you,...

70
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,940
No one can go home, especially you.

71
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,270
I won't leave you.

72
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,670
... can see you anytime...

73
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,750
The place I could love you as much as I wished.

74
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,180
But if I stay in this house,

75
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,190
I don't think I can stay next to you.

76
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,790
Then I'll get going.

77
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,090
But since you've come anyway,

78
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,830
why we've gotten together today,

79
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,130
I think it might be good for you
to hear the reason before you go.

80
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,640
Yes, well I'm sure through SNS (social networks)

81
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,310
you all might already know
but this unni next to me is

82
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,280
Cheong Hae, chairman Heo's ex-wife.

83
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,410
She's his previous wife.

84
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,980
As she divorced him,

85
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,320
meanwhile, this unni was
completely separated from her son,

86
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,360
but not long ago the two of
them were dramatically reunited.

87
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,430
- The son who left home? - Yes.

88
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,600
- The whereabouts unknown?  - Yes.

89
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,530
- Omo, congratulations.
- Yes, congratulations. Applause.

90
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,070
I told you

91
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,670
I'd make sure to find my Joon Jae and

92
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,810
return everything to its original place.

93
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,580
Look forward to it.

94
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,350
I congratulate you so much.

95
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,850
It's so moving that you found your son,

96
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:39,860
but returning your son to his
original place won't be easy.

97
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,260
That place disappeared.

98
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,000
What?

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,630
You all probably haven't heard yet, but

100
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,470
not long ago my husband, regarding
domestic and overseas real estate,

101
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,510
stocks, cash, capital, everything,

102
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,840
he got his will notarized
that he'd leave everything

103
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,710
to me and Chi Hyeon.

104
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,020
You know that if he steps back, the one
who will probably inherit that position

105
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,590
will be my Chi Hyeon, right?

106
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,060
I will remember well all the faces of

107
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,430
the people gathered here today.

108
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,470
As you live your lives going forward,

109
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,170
pray that you don't ever need my help.

110
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,550
Do you think what she's saying is true, Unni?

111
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,690
If that's true, then President Heo is crazy, right?!

112
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,290
I know, right? Why would he leave his biological
son and do that? What could be so urgent?

113
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,090
I know!

114
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,800
If this talk is real, President
Heo, is a puppet, a puppet!

115
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,970
He— Hello?

116
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,710
- It's me.  - Who are you?

117
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,240
What?

118
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,710
You are?

119
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,780
What are you saying again?

120
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,720
I'm being chased by people,
but I don't know why. Should I know them?

121
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,620
What's the matter with you?

122
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,460
Didn't I tell you to take your medicine?

123
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,830
Have you finally cracked? Where are you now?

124
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,400
I don't really know where I am, nor who I am.

125
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,910
- Where's father? - On the second floor.

126
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,140
And the other people?

127
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,910
They just left.

128
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,880
I definitely heard someone saying
"Father!" in the chairman's room.

129
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,680
But I could have heard it wrong, of course.

130
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,250
Yes.

131
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,830
- Father? - Yes.

132
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Are you feeling ill?

133
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,440
- It's Chi Hyeon, I see. - Yes.

134
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,970
Did anyone come in here?

135
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,640
Who?

136
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,180
The maid said some maintenance
workers were wandering around.

137
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,450
Really? Because I was asleep

138
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,420
I didn't know.

139
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,560
Okay.

140
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,340
We've tried to check, but the system has been down
for the last two hours so nothing got recorded.

141
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,770
So, are you saying you still
don't know what's going on?

142
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,710
I apologize. Something like this rarely
happens. I will check the entire system.

143
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,280
You bastards! What good is it now?!

144
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,830
Here are all the documents. I've also
confirmed that his will was notarized.

145
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,200
Does it really say that Joon Jae's father will
leave everything to Kang Seo Hee and her son?

146
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,440
It's been witnessed? It's all done?

147
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,550
It seems you were completely abandoned.

148
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,620
Why do I feel deflated?

149
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,820
There's no proof that my
father reviewed the will.

150
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,150
What do you mean?

151
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,890
My father...

152
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,530
has lost most of his vision.

153
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,100
- Traumatic corneal injury. - I'm not certain, but

154
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,440
he was staring right at me,
yet couldn't recognize me.

155
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,660
Then why did you come out alone?

156
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,710
After going all the way there,
why didn't you bring your father out?

157
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,080
He said he couldn't believe me... since I'm a conman.

158
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,860
Also, please investigate this.
It's from that woman's bedroom.

159
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,830
What's that? Isn't it a needle?

160
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,730
The prime offender of the corneal damage?

161
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,340
Hey, this one even scares me.

162
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,940
Also. This.

163
00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:00,180
Kang Seo Hee is too suspicious to take drugs
herself. She probably fed these to my father.

164
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,420
Find out the drug's ingredients and
under whose name it was prescribed.

165
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,380
There's one more thing.

166
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,950
Her room was filled with these flowers.

167
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,420
They seemed suspicious,
so I took some pictures of them.

168
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,560
What flower is this?

169
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,330
Nordic wolfsbane?

170
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,700
- What? - It's also called Stepmother's poison.

171
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,800
In Roman times,

172
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,080
stepmothers used this flower to assassinate
the royal prince while fighting for the throne.

173
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,680
If it's really Nordic wolfsbane, a few years
ago in Japan, as well as in our country,

174
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,070
there were incidents where people got

175
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,620
and boiled this to get
people addicted to kill them.

176
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,790
So please help us, Detective.
We don't have much time.

177
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,530
Because we have all this evidence, we have to
get the warrant soon and get into that house.

178
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,990
Hey, do you think it's that easy—

179
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,430
I'll get it quickly, so don't worry.

180
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,920
Ma Dae Young. It's me, Kang Seo Hee.

181
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,370
It's me. Kang Ji Hyun!

182
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,980
Hi. Are you Dae Young? I am Kang Ji Hyun.

183
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,190
Didn't you get kicked out a little while ago?

184
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,530
The Mister told me that I will
return to that house again.

185
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,330
But then, why did you get kicked out?

186
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,400
Because I would cry and scream every
night because of scary nightmares.

187
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,410
Is it a rich family?

188
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,780
My twin sister went to a rich family.

189
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,380
I also wish that would happen to me..

190
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,480
Even after I get adopted by that family,

191
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,420
can I still write letters to
you if I have some questions?

192
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,460
Thanks. What have you been drawing?

193
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,760
Is it The Little Mermaid?

194
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,880
Upstairs.

195
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,860
Hey!

196
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,890
What are you doing?

197
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,600
Are you sick? What's the matter?
Did something happen?

198
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,000
What were you doing?

199
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,010
Let me look.

200
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,380
Why are you cold?

201
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,210
- Go.  - What?

202
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,850
Leave! I wish you wouldn't listen to my thoughts.

203
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,320
I have something to think about
but because you might hear them,

204
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,920
I can't think of anything
clearly and my mind's a mess.

205
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,960
Think about? What?

206
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,430
Don't even ask. Do you need my permission to think?

207
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,830
I don't have any idea what's on your mind,

208
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,300
but you listen to my every thought.

209
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,200
Do you know unpleasant and awful that is?!

210
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,570
Please stay away from me.

211
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,980
If not, should I leave?

212
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,320
No. I'll stay far away from you.

213
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,920
Whatever you want to think about, think about it.

214
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,590
You're...

215
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,400
really okay, right?

216
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,270
Your heart seems to be beating just fine.

217
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,440
Just hurry and go.

218
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,210
Right, I was going anyhow.

219
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,860
What should I... Should I just
leave the room, or the house?

220
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,830
It's cold outside, though. I'll just
sleep on the sofa in the living room.

221
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,760
I can't hear you from over there.

222
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,900
I really can't.
I will tell you if I do, honestly, okay?

223
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,440
That I can hear and will ask
you not to think too hard.

224
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,310
I got it. Can you leave now?

225
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,840
Okay.

226
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,820
Go to your room. I have to sleep here tonight.

227
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,160
- Why? - Cheong told me I had to leave.

228
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,300
She told you that? I guess you must've
been caught doing something wrong.

229
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,700
No, there's nothing more to be caught. Since she
knows about my swindling, she knows it all.

230
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,410
Right, there's nothing more to be found out.

231
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,110
- So why would she suddenly tell you to
leave? - She had some stuff to think about.

232
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,580
Then that means there is still
something left to be caught.

233
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,650
There's none I said.

234
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,960
Don't you know what it means when a woman
says she has something to think about?

235
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,060
What is it?

236
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,390
In other words, I know what wrong you did.
It means the guy did something wrong.

237
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,330
The woman is thinking about what she
would do with the guy and what he did.

238
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,970
Whether to punish by "death by
dismemberment" or just flog a few times.

239
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,640
Is this what that means?

240
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,310
Of course. Are you sure you didn't
lie or hide anything from her

241
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,080
or have something to be busted for?

242
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,490
So? Tell me everything that you remember!

243
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,760
Kang Ji Hyun. Angel Orphanage, and...

244
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,800
Isn't that a person?

245
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,270
And people I don't know. Corpses that I don't know.

246
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:42,380
I can hear screams of people but I
don't know why they are doing it to me.

247
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,820
How can that be? Listen carefully to what I say.

248
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,730
I don't know why your memory is
suddenly going back and forth,

249
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:00,600
but even if your memories are
gone, Ma Dae Young is Ma Dae Young.

250
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,100
Ma Dae Young? What kind of person is he?

251
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,840
Someone who must seek revenge.

252
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,610
R-Revenge?

253
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,050
You really don't remember?

254
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,520
I don't.

255
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,090
The world abandoned you.
The world is just happy by iteslf.

256
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,390
Since you were born,
when were you ever really happy?

257
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,500
You have lived as if you
were always being punished.

258
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,200
That's why you are taking revenge
on the world that has abandoned you.

259
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,910
You always did what you should do.

260
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,980
So, are you saying that... that many people...

261
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,750
I really killed them? I can't remember anything.

262
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,090
You always said you didn't remember.
You had problems with your rage.

263
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,360
If it acts up, maybe you can't remember.

264
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,800
Don't worry. As always,

265
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,640
I will be by your side.

266
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,940
Who you will be taking revenge on... I will tell you.

267
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,290
Eat! I really can't hear anything.

268
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,190
Come out and eat! Hurry up!

269
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,610
Isn't that mine?

270
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,840
What did you say?

271
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,810
Why is it so loud?

272
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,420
Oh? Soybean paste stew for breakfast.

273
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,150
Why is it so loud, I said!

274
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,720
It's soybean paste stew!

275
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,690
What are you doing? This is mine.

276
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,430
I need that for the time being. Lend it to me.

277
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,730
Hey, it's nice since it's quiet,

278
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,470
I thought my ears were going to burst.

279
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,070
But then, I covered my ears but my throat hurts.

280
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,140
A person who is smart should
think why his throat hurts.

281
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,790
The soybean paste stew is really delicious!

282
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,320
It's seasoned just right!

283
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,260
Let's eat. Eat. Come.

284
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,760
Why not?

285
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,870
How did you find all that
evidence without a warrant?

286
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,950
You obtained it illegally by
breaking into a private property.

287
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,870
Isn't that right? Do you want to get fired?

288
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,040
How is it a break-in?
Heo Joon Jae is the son of that household.

289
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,180
The son went into his house.
It's not like he broke in.

290
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,880
They opened the door for him and
he walked in fair and square.

291
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,850
Aigoo. Dressed as a maintenance man too?

292
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,720
He always liked those kinds of clothes.

293
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,220
Like uniforms. It's his personal preference.

294
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,590
Quiet, punk!

295
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:19,030
The medicine that Kang Seo
Hee had was anticholinergic.

296
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,790
It's used as a muscle relaxer
during an anesthetic procedure.

297
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,740
It is prescribed to insomnia patients.

298
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,300
She made him take these,

299
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,710
then she cut his corneas. I'm sure of it.

300
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,840
Evidence obtained illegally
can't be accepted in court!

301
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,480
You know it, so why are you being like this?

302
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,820
What do I know? I don't know.

303
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,150
I don't know at all!

304
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,860
I met your father's ophthalmologist.
When he looked at that needle,

305
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,570
he agreed that the needle
could have caused the injury.

306
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,370
He said your father needs to get
the cornea replacement surgery soon.

307
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,880
- What about others?- The witnesses for the
notarization of the will, and the attorney.

308
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,410
We are tracking them.

309
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,390
Aigoo. You hack that so easily.

310
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,290
I'll pretend I didn't see.

311
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,540
Ahjumma!

312
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,680
Yes, Madame.

313
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,140
Did someone come in here?

314
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,450
No. But not too long ago when
they were inspecting for insects—

315
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,780
I told you not to let anyone in here!

316
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,520
Hey, is she going to figure it out?

317
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,990
Let's set the D-day to be tomorrow.
Get the search warrant.

318
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,560
If not, we can force our way in even without it.

319
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,180
Honey.

320
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,320
Take your medicine.

321
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,260
You need to have your condition improve soon
so that you can receive cataract surgery.

322
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,960
Just leave it here. I will take it a little later.

323
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,100
Okay.

324
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,650
Kang Seo Hee's real name is Kang Ji Hyun.

325
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,950
She got married twice. And both husbands,

326
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,320
one from a car accident due to
the traumatic damage to cornea,

327
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,020
and the other from heart
failure, have passed away.

328
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:57,750
You met Joon Jae. You don't know
how much of a relief that is.

329
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,220
Secretary Nam would soon get up too.

330
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:09,030
The doctors said that he could recover
like a miracle in a situation like this,

331
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,860
but as we lived he was always on the unlucky side.

332
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,330
Miracles were never on my side.

333
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,680
They said that good and bad luck
is measured for every person.

334
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,080
Until now, since you have used up all the bad luck,

335
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,080
now only good luck is left, just like a miracle.

336
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,350
Mr. Choi Myung Gyu?

337
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:14,560
Yes, yes. Let me introduce myself.
I'm Choi Myung Gyu.

338
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,400
- This is mine.- Oh, okay.

339
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,130
But will an aquarium of such a huge
scale will be made at Sentosa Island?

340
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,240
Yes. I am not an expert on that but rather on
investments. I'm just doing market research.

341
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,340
Yes. Let's go.

342
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,510
Yes.

343
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,380
Sand Tiger Sharks originate from Florida, USA.

344
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,360
The price it can fetch
is about ₩ 100,000,000 ($100,000 USD).

345
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,920
Whale Shark can range about ₩ 1,000,000,000 (1M USD).

346
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,090
Is that right?

347
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,900
If that's the case, and a mermaid
existed, what would it fetch?

348
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,400
A mermaid? A real mermaid?

349
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,340
Not the kind that stars in a mermaid
show, but a real mermaid.

350
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,670
I'm not certain.

351
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,340
There has been an incident when a cadaver
presumed to be a mermaid was discovered.

352
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,750
Whether it was a hoax or not
hasn't been determined. However,

353
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,980
if a real live mermaid were to be found,

354
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,820
then, well, would be impossible
for me to put a price on it.

355
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,990
Wouldn't it cost several hundred billion
won? (several hundred million dollars)

356
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,630
Why the question, though?

357
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,030
Just curious is all.
I happen to have a close mermaid friend.

358
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,670
Would you introduce that close
mermaid friend to me as well?

359
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,540
Of course, I'd like to.

360
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,080
- Shall we? - Okay.

361
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:43,720
Try to cry. Try to cry? Why did I ask (her) to cry?

362
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,090
Ugh. Tear...

363
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,290
Tears, eh?

364
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,920
Hey you player-mermaid.

365
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,870
You said something about the romantic love, but
your tendency towards dirty love is on the rise.

366
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:09,040
How can you consider this dirty love?
At this level.

367
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,710
A mermaid? Nonsense.

368
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,860
What is hurting?

369
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,720
I was so surprised at your call

370
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,730
that I skipped out on after
school academy and came straight here.

371
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:34,000
Thank you for coming.
I just wanted to see your faces.

372
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,600
I might have to leave this
place in the near future.

373
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,040
I wanted to say my goodbyes beforehand.

374
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:48,150
You are the first truly good
friend I met when I came here.

375
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,080
Whenever I had difficulty,
you became someone I could rely on,

376
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,420
and at times you were more
like the elder sister than I.

377
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,620
That's a little burdensome for me to hear.

378
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,660
You can't do anything about it
if it's burdensome as it's true.

379
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,600
Then what about me? What was I to you?

380
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,160
You were a teacher.

381
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,670
When I came here without knowing
anything, you taught me everything.

382
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,770
- You are really smart.  - Oh, what are you saying?

383
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,380
I'm telling the truth. Your stories
are too good to not be shared.

384
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,080
But you're the only one who listens to me.
No one else does.

385
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,650
If I try to engage them in a conversation,
they either give me money or spit on me.

386
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,020
I suppose it's because of the
way my appearance is like this.

387
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,990
Regardless of what your appearance
displays, you're a great life coach to me.

388
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,330
Running into you by chance
here has been a fortune.

389
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,200
They say that life is a
series of chance encounters.

390
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,200
When you value the chance encounters, then
life will be filled with good connections.

391
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,810
or if not, life will become a lonely one.

392
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:55,780
See? What you are saying is falling right into
my ears. You really are a great life coach.

393
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,020
She's right. I, too,
am always learning when I'm with you.

394
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,420
Let me hug you guys once, my friends.

395
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,310
Hey Joon Jae, it's me...

396
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,980
I'm at a cafe in your neighborhood.

397
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,050
Can you meet me for a second?
I have something I must tell you.

398
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,650
Yep. I had something I had to tell you too.

399
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,760
You must have heard.

400
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,860
- My mom... - Right. I know.

401
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:52,170
As we lived in the same house, I somehow felt
close to her and didn't feel like a stranger,

402
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,510
but to find out that she was the
mother you were estranged from...

403
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,650
I thought perhaps things like this is a fate.

404
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,080
Fate?

405
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,450
What kind of fate?

406
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,820
Um... it's... That is...

407
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,760
I don't know how this would sound to you.

408
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,960
Perhaps I might have missed the timing.

409
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,600
But I want to tell you at least once, Joon Jae.

410
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,240
Okay. Do tell me.

411
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,110
I like you very much, not as a friend but as a man.

412
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,610
For seven years

413
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,880
I looked at your back more than your eyes.
And it's not like I don't know

414
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,020
who is in your heart right now.

415
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:46,490
I like you, so I can wait.

416
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:53,300
- You're saying you will wait?  -
Eventually, won't Ms. Cheong have to leave?

417
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,740
I know that she's a strange,
facinating, charming, and lovely woman.

418
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,210
However, I don't believe she's someone
who will be staying put continually. So—

419
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,480
Don't wait for me.

420
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,520
Cheong will not go anywhere.
She'll continue to stay by me.

421
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,560
Even if Cheong goes somewhere
else, I'll be following her, so

422
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,190
don't wait for me, Si Ah.

423
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,860
From now on, don't even look at my back,

424
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:29,070
and find a good man who can look into your eyes.

425
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,070
I should have told you a bit sooner,

426
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,070
so I'm sorry.

427
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,200
- Why are you here again?
- Since you've come to my house.

428
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,470
And like a little rat, no less.

429
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,370
This bast...

430
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,450
Why?

431
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,890
Why did you come to my house?

432
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,090
Were you trying to meet our father or something?

433
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:28,460
Joon Jae, Father tells me that
he'd rather not see his con son.

434
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,130
He says that for his son, I alone am enough!

435
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,900
Shut your mouth.

436
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,670
Why?

437
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,840
Did I say something incorrect?

438
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,240
That you're a con is correct as you know.

439
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,280
Shit. What an embarrassment.

440
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,410
Why didn't you tell me that
Dad's eyes are in that state?

441
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,080
I did tell you for sure.
The one who ignored it is you.

442
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,990
The fact that it was due to your mother?

443
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,130
Haven't you known very well
everything your mother has been doing?

444
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,900
Were you letting it continue even
though you knew it all along?

445
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,300
Why?

446
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,500
Why, you crazy SOB?

447
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,810
You said he was the first father you
had, so how can you do that?

448
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,180
Let go. Aren't you going to let go?!

449
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,110
Stop your mother right now.

450
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,980
Make her stop the thing she's
trying to do to my father.

451
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,320
I already have come to know,

452
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:34,060
and I won't sit by and let it be any
longer. If it progresses any further,

453
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,000
you and your mother will both die. I will

454
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,400
ensure that happens.

455
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,850
Ms. Cheong came to see me.

456
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,650
You sent her to me just so that
you can sneak into my house?

457
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,120
Just to keep me anchored?

458
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,520
Do you think you're in a
position to protect anyone?

459
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:36,460
♬  By even saying I love
doesn't become comforting ♬

460
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:42,430
♬  I'm falling into a deep darkness. ♬

461
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,330
♬  By even saying I love... ♬

462
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,510
What?

463
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,050
The thoughts you wish I wouldn't hear,

464
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,890
tell me all of them now,
including why you're being this way now.

465
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,630
The bracelet I gave you...

466
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,630
When I discovered the
bracelet deep in the ocean,

467
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,040
I thought it was a coincidence.

468
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,380
When I think back on it now,
it wasn't a coincidence.

469
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,110
That was the moment when
everything started again.

470
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,220
I always wondered what the reason was that

471
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:44,820
I swam all that distance
across the ocean to see you.

472
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,060
But even that turned out to be fate.

473
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,730
The fate that mustn't start again.

474
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,030
What are you talking about?

475
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,440
You said we will live well,
not getting sick nor getting hurt,

476
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,910
living long and happily until a ripe old age

477
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,480
was our last lifetime's story.

478
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,980
Why did you lie? It wasn't happily ever after.

479
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,860
You because of me,

480
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,860
and I because of you, we died in the end.

481
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,600
In the cold sea.

482
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,030
That...

483
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,300
How...

484
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:38,110
The day you went to your father's
house, I met Heo Chi Hyeon.

485
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,250
And I saw Ma Dae Young as well.

486
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:46,390
Because I held Ma Dae Young's hands
and erased all of his stories,

487
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:54,590
in that way, I saw our last
story enmeshed in his memory.

488
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,660
Then...

489
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:04,170
The most scary dream to me is
the one where everything repeats.

490
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,010
A dream where everything repeats?

491
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:13,280
I came to know the meaning of
the scary dream you feared.

492
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:21,090
So it is, I, who was the scariest
dream to you. Isn't that right?

493
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,090
No.

494
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:27,560
You still wanted to take that path,
yet again, knowing that it repeats.

495
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,630
I said it's not true. Who said it repeated?

496
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,630
That won't happen.

497
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,500
I shouldn't have come.

498
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,310
Then nothing would have started again.

499
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,180
So?

500
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,550
Do you regret it?

501
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:54,990
Meeting me, coming here, and us being together?

502
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,860
♬ Did I wake up from a long dream?♬

503
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,200
♬ As soon as I recognized you♬

504
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,600
♬ My nameless love♬

505
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,040
♬ may have started♬

506
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:25,020
♬ Before I knew you, was the sky ♬

507
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:33,590
♬ always as brilliant? ♬

508
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:42,270
♬ If out of ten thousand chances
our love came into being ♬

509
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:50,410
♬ If out of ten thousand
chances, you and I could begin ♬

510
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:54,810
♬ I will use the feeling and ♬

511
00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:03,520
♬ the love which may not end for you. ♬

512
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,830
♬ All of my moments are for you. ♬

513
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,270
No.

514
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,510
I don't regret it.

515
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,080
How can I regret it?

516
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,880
I was the same.

517
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,290
Despite knowing all of it,

518
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:37,690
I just couldn't regret it.

519
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:40,660
Meeting you was

520
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,330
not something I could regret
no matter how I saw it.

521
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:49,070
I'm afraid you're going to die because of me.

522
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:55,270
If, I mean if, perhaps that
what you fear were to happen,

523
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,510
your heart must continue to beat.

524
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,390
You should know this by now,
that even if I'm not by your side,

525
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,720
that I will continue to love you.

526
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,060
♬ I will use the feeling and ♬

527
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:20,070
♬ the love which may not end ♬

528
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:24,870
♬ for you ♬

529
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:31,680
♬ All of my moments are for you ♬

530
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,390
- Hello? - Hey, you jerk!

531
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:46,120
I'm ruined because of you. What am I to do now?

532
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,590
Where are you?

533
00:46:53,330 --> 00:47:00,630
Hey Tae Ho, were you in pain like this?
Were you this sad?

534
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:09,710
For me... For me...
I ache like my heart is being torn apart.

535
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:18,650
I truly, really... liked him so much for so long.

536
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,500
Stay here temporarily.

537
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,450
No one goes down to the room in the
basement, so stay there during the day.

538
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:25,820
The housekeeper goes home at 5pm,

539
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,920
Hey. Hey!

540
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,090
It'll be fine to come upstairs in the evening.

541
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,190
What's she suggesting?
Was there someone who went in that house?

542
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,260
It was just Kang So Hee's car
that went into the garage.

543
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,660
Was there someone else riding in that car?

544
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:56,350
Heo Il Joong knows your voice and thinks
you're his newly obtained secretary.

545
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,950
Assess the situation by staying
nearby pretending to assist him.

546
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,060
Making sure he can't go out anywhere.

547
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,860
Prevent him from contacting
anyone via cellphone.

548
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:11,830
It won't be so difficult as he can't see.

549
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,500
Can you still not remember anything?

550
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:23,040
Gosh, come to your senses, for
goodness sake! We're almost at the end.

551
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,310
Heo Il Joong, knows your voice and

552
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,910
thinks that you're his
newly obtained secretary.

553
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,020
Assess the situation by staying
nearby pretending to assist him.

554
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,750
Make sure he can't go out anywhere.

555
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:45,690
Prevent him from contacting
anyone via cellphone.

556
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,990
As he can't see...

557
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,760
Who is she telling this to right now?

558
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,900
The other person's voice can't be heard at all.

559
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,700
You still can't remember anything?

560
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,070
Come to your senses for goodness sake!

561
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,270
Ma Dae Young.

562
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:07,010
It's Ma Dae Young.
He can't remember anything right now.

563
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:08,450
What are you saying that he can't remember?

564
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:12,650
That who he is, or what terrible
deed he has done thus far...

565
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,090
Why are you saying that he
can't remember those things?

566
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,360
You can ask him that in person when you've
arrested him. What about the search warrant?

567
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,090
I think we'll get it early tomorrow morning.

568
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,960
Thank you.

569
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,150
Honey.

570
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,950
What?

571
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:47,020
I have an urgent appointment
to keep this evening.

572
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,690
So take the medicine and go to sleep early, okay?

573
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,860
Oh, right. Put it here.

574
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,800
Medicine. Make sure you take it, okay?

575
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,270
Uh, right.

576
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:08,370
Where is your phone?

577
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,810
I don't know. I'm not sure.

578
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,920
The phone is turned off at the moment...

579
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,660
I'll be back.

580
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,130
Seo Hee.

581
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,760
What?

582
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:39,910
Since you've met me, was there a
single moment when you loved me?

583
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:49,720
I never had a single moment when I didn't love you.

584
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,550
I'll be back.

585
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,090
Okay.

586
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,500
Where are you headed at this hour?

587
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,570
Oh, Son. Where are you?

588
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:49,740
Will you have a drink with Mom? It's been a while.

589
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,540
In a place with a lot of people around.

590
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,820
I have an appointment. I'm with other people.

591
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,490
Please head home. Quickly.

592
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,000
Joon Jae.

593
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,430
The money seems to have been deposited
under the attorney's borrowed name.

594
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,750
Joon Jae...

595
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,480
You should not be home already.

596
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,910
Joon Jae...

597
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:03,980
Your father was wrong.

598
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,750
Joon Jae...

599
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,250
Hyung, please contact the detective Hong.

600
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:16,120
Ah, and I might not be able to come
home tonight. Please look after Cheong.

601
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,190
Hey, what's going on?

602
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,230
What's going on?

603
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:22,960
Not sure.

604
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,540
You were right.

605
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:43,520
My decision was wrong from the start to the end.

606
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,320
I'm not sure why admitting that was so difficult.

607
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,020
I'm not sure why it took so long.

608
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:56,600
I always missed

609
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,430
the times together with you and your mother.

610
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,500
I wanted to return to those times...

611
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,740
Why did I live without accepting that feeling?

612
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:19,820
Why was the word I'm sorry so difficult to say?

613
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:28,460
I'm so regretful now.

614
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,400
If I were to be born again,

615
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:14,340
I'd like to live once again as

616
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:20,510
my wife's husband and my son's
father. I suppose it's just my greed?

617
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:24,920
I'm sorry, Joon Jae.

618
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,670
I love you, my son.

619
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,750
It's not true.

620
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,190
It's not supposed to be yet.

621
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:05,890
It's not supposed to be over yet, Father.

622
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,470
Wait, please. Wait, Father.

623
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,760
It's not time yet, Father.

624
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,900
Please.

625
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,340
DAD!

626
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:55,640
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
