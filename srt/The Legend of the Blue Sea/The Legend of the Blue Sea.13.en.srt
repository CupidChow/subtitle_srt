2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,050
Thinking... How much are you planning to do?

3
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,420
The whole night.

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,550
Whole night?

5
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,720
You... I don't know what kind of
thoughts you have in your head.

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,490
I don't know, but whatever that is

7
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,730
can you not do it?

8
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,930
What does this mean?
Does he mean not to think of him?

9
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,940
What does that look mean? Is he mad at me? Why?

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,980
Now, it's nice and quiet.

11
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,550
Starting now don't think of anything.

12
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,190
And... don't do anything either.

♬ This is love story  ♬

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,470
♬ I cannot hide ♬

15
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,310
♬ My two eyes which only see you ♬

16
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,180
♬ I cannot close them ♬

17
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,880
♬ This is amazing ♬

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,490

00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,540
Heo Joon Jae.

22
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,880
There's definitely a reason for the village
head releasing the sky lanterns by the sea.

23
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,010
When they are released by the sea,

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,780
the mermaid will definitely
come out of the water.

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,650
No. Se Hwa!

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,160
Are you alright?

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,170
It's okay. You're no longer in a dream.

28
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,150
- Did you have a scary dream? - Yeah.

29
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,190
It was scary.

30
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,860
How come?

31
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,090
I know.

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,600
I originally didn't have anything to be
afraid of since I had nothing to lose.

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,230
But now

34
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,810
it's scary. Now that I might lose something...

35
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,880
- Who? - Huh?

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,150
- Se Hwa? - Come again?

37
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,990
I heard it all, you know. You were saying, "No. Se Hwa."

38
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,460
Who is it? Who is Se Hwa?

39
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,000
Is she also a fish that you
are keeping on the hook?

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,100
- No. It's not that. - Then who is it?

41
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,870
Is it a woman?

42
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,370
Well, yes, she's a woman.

43
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,240
Oh, she's a woman, I see.

44
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,280
Is she pretty?

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,580
Should I tell you honestly?

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,080
You need to tell me honestly.
We promised not to lie.

47
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,560
She's pretty. Very.

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,800
Really pretty?

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
Then what about me?

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,900
You are pretty, too.

51
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,870
What the... You should decide. What are you
trying to do by saying both of us are pretty?

52
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,200
Are you two-timing us like an octopus?
Is that how it is?

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,940
What? You also know how to say those?

54
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,210
Hurry and answer me.
I'm speaking with Gungsuh font on.

55
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,040
What's "Gungsuh" font?

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,220
It's Gungsuh font. It means I'm serious.

57
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,550
Don't you know this word, Heo Joon Jae?
It's all over the internet.

58
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,720
Anyway, hurry and answer because
I'm speaking in Gungsuh font.

59
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,620
Well, of course...

60
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,930
It's you.

61
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,770
Is this really true? He's not just
telling me to keep me on the hook?

62
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,970
What about Se Hwa? Is he for real?

63
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,000
Isn't he scamming me?
Am I really prettier than Se Hwa?

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,440
Where does she live? What does she do?

65
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,510
I'm saying it's you.

66
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,710
- Gosh, darn dog-good. - Huh?

67
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,620
In this case, the word "dog-good"
doesn't mean that I like dogs.

68
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,890
It means that I like this a lot and very much.

69
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,260
Everyone on the internet uses it. If you don't
know, then you should memorize it, Heo Joon Jae.

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,030
Where are you going?

71
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,200
I have to go up.

72
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,970
Don't go.

73
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,810
Heo Joon Jae, are you drunk?

74
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,810
That's something you say when you are drunk.

75
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,250
Let's just say that I'm drunk. Anyway, don't go.

76
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,460
I won't go.

77
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,590
Heo Joon Jae.

78
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,060
Huh?

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,030
You know...

80
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,600
Earlier, that...

81
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,840
What about that?

82
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,180
No, earlier that...

83
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,510
This?

84
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,490
This... Can I not forget this one?

85
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,220
Of course, you can't. Would it do if you forgot?

86
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,630
Deal. I won't forget this one this time.

87
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,270
Let's go to sleep.

88
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,500
I need to sleep with you like this
so that I won't have scary dreams.

89
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,210
Heo Joon Jae, I wish you would
have scary dreams every night.

90
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,910
Scary dreams are dog-good.

91
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,590
♬ I love you, idiot! ♬

92
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,630
♬ It means I'm waiting for you ♬

93
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,100
♬ That's what's happening, idiot.
My heart keeps palpitating ♬

94
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,110
♬ My heart goes bounce. Bounce.
Why don't you know my heart ♬

95
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,810
Heo Joon Jae likes me.

96
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,980
Heo Joon Jae likes me!

97
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,720
Heo Joon Jae likes me too. Heo Joon
Jae likes me. Heo Joon Jae likes me.

98
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,760
Heo Joon Jae likes me.

99
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,000
What if this bursts at this rate?!

100
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,100
It's so piping hot, seriously. Why do I feel so hot?

101
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,910
My strength... I can't control it!

102
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,840
The Legend of the Blue Sea

103
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,880
Episode 13

104
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,660
Yes.

105
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,030
Ahjumma, can you get me some honey water?

106
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you doing?

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Seriously, I feel like
throwing up when I see alcohol.

108
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,140
Soju and even with kimchi at that, seriously.

109
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,990
Ahjumma, why were you drinking?
Did something happen?

110
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,060
What?

111
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,130
Because I'm thankful.

112
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,300
It's been such a long time since
I've had someone ask me what's wrong.

113
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,070
What's wrong? What happened?

114
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,740
Honestly, I met my ex-husband today.

115
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,940
Oh, my! Coincidentally?

116
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,250
Even though

117
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,850
our eyes definitely met,
he pretended not to see me.

118
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,420
Really?

119
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,990
He might have been taken aback. Is that why?

120
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,660
I can understand if he was
taken aback or flustered,

121
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,160
but he just really

122
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,500
had the gaze of looking at a complete stranger.

123
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,770
There must be things that time cannot heal.

124
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,640
Time has gone by like this.

125
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,480
But it still hurts.

126
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,720
What are you doing? You said you feel like
throwing up even at the sight of alcohol.

127
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,060
How can I not drink after listening to this?

128
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,330
Ahjumma, don't drink soju. Let's drink wine.

129
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,270
Here. How could you have
lived with that kind of jerk?

130
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,700
Let's have a drink.

131
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,610
I was also really upset today.

132
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,580
Why?

133
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,880
You know that woman whom I'm
always bribing with side dishes...

134
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,920
Well, after drinking...

135
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,490
I acted up a bit in front of that woman.

136
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,190
Because I did so, you can't imagine
how coldly she shrugged me off.

137
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,260
I even knelt and she just pretended not to see.

138
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,830
You even knelt?

139
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah. I did.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But honestly, I didn't say anything wrong.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,210
That woman stole the husband
of her high school classmate

142
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,480
to secure that position.

143
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,080
She's really foul-hearted, right?

144
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,520
The first wife didn't receive
a single farthing of alimony,

145
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
and she just left as if she was chased out.

146
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,320
They don't have any news of her.

147
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,590
She's missing.

148
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,970
Which household's story is that?

149
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,800
You probably don't know this person very
well. There's a person named Heo Il Joong.

150
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,610
He's a real estate chaebol.

151
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,910
Out of say three or four worthwhile buildings
in Gangnam, at least one is that household's.

152
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,710
They're really no joke.

153
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,480
But do you know what's funny about that
family? They are developing a new city.

154
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,290
But they won't let us get involved, you know?

155
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,090
We offered up so many side dishes,

156
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,360
but she won't let us get involved.

157
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,630
That household was that one?

158
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,030
I told you it is.

159
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,570
My side dishes.

160
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,110
That was the household that's been
taking and eating my dishes...

161
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,010
But if they continue to ignore me
like this, I won't just stand still.

162
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,650
I will spread that rumor
through the whole Gangnam!

163
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,320
My mouth does what it says it will do.

164
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,060
The world is so small.

165
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,990
It is. So small. The rumors would spread in no time.

166
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,030
Just let them wait and see.

167
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,240
You fixed the contents of the will
according to what I told you, right?

168
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,410
So that everything will be
inherited by Chi Hyeon and me.

169
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,880
We need to make sure the minimal amount of
inheritance will be in Heo Joon Jae's name

170
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,720
so you won't be caught up in a
biological child restoration lawsuit.

171
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,470
There won't be any such thing as
a biological child restoration lawsuit

172
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,660
so carry it out according to my wishes.

173
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,000
And about Representative Lee
and Executive Director Jeong.

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They'll be witnesses, right?
Everything's been agreed upon, right?

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,400
Yes, well, it was done.

176
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,600
But will it really be okay?

177
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,710
None of them will do it for free, right?

178
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,680
The same goes for you, too.

179
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,820
If this case goes well, you probably
will be able to set up a law firm.

180
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,290
I arranged it as he told me to.

181
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,930
Notarized Last Will and Testament
Drafted on December 28, 2016,

182
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,060
the last will and testament of Heo Il Joong.

183
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,400
Have you confirmed it?

184
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,300
Yes, we have.

185
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,840
CEO Heo, please affix your stamp.

186
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,110
I can't see properly so where is it?

187
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,950
Here.

188
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,740
It seems like a lot has changed.

189
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,880
Yeah. Since I couldn't fall asleep
and stuff, I changed it a bit.

190
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,480
Alone? This would have been so heavy.

191
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,950
It wasn't.

192
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,280
It was really light.

193
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,760
She's strength-Cheong. Strength-Cheong
today.(Strength rhymes with Sim)

194
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:30,180
Heo Joon Jae likes me.

195
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,520
♬ Heo Joon Jae likes me.

196
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,690
Is it lucky that only I can hear it?

197
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,760
♬  Heo Joon Jae likes me

198
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,330
Enough now. ♬ Heo Joon Jae likes

199
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,930
Good morning.

200
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,030
Heo Joon Jae!

201
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,170
Heo Joon Jae, when the lease
expires, where will we move to?

202
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm not sure. There's still so much time left,
but I should still think about it. Why?

203
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,680
My health status is so good so I was thinking
of moving the furniture one by one prior.

204
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,040
What?

205
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,710
Joon Jae about this kid, our Strength-Cheong.

206
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,150
Who's the one who decided to change her
battery? Take it out. It's so disorienting.

207
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,850
- Why take it out? It's good.
What do you want for breakfast? - Rice.

208
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,950
Pasta.

209
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,690
Why eat noodles early in the morning?
Let's eat rice.

210
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,060
We don't have pasta noodles, though.

211
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,230
I will go and buy them. I will.

212
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,660
I said rice.

213
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,400
Will you? Go and buy it.

214
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,660
Tomato pasta?

215
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,470
Call! (means deal like you would in poker)

216
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,380
Grandma, I will help you.

217
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,750
- Oh no, it's heavy.- I'll pull it.

218
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,620
It's heavy though.

219
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,640
Thank you.

220
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,650
Look for the phone number.

221
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,650
There's none.

222
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,420
Still this car needs to be moved.

223
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,620
A car!

224
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,730
There was a car here before.

225
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,410
Did she go and make pasta noodles?
Why is she taking so long?

226
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,410
Try calling her, Tae Oh.

227
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:47,250
Heo Joon Jae likes me.

228
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,890
She's almost here.

229
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,220
Almost here? How do you know?

230
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,130
I'm here.

231
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,300
Do you guys communicate through telepathy now?

232
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,800
Cute.

233
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,540
You know let's close up the Ahn Jin Joo
case because the losses are too big.

234
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,740
I have new work I'm looking into.

235
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,010
No, this time it's not a bad thing.
He's the worse person.

236
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,220
He's someone who amassed a
fortune from voice phishing.

237
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,020
I told you I'm not doing it.

238
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,530
- You're not? - Yeah.

239
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,630
As expected, Heo Joon Jae really likes me.

240
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,240
Eat.

241
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,340
Eat a lot.

242
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,180
What?

243
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,520
Sit down.

244
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,850
What now?

245
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,890
Are you sick of having to talk with me like this?

246
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,060
Did anyone say so?

247
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,460
Tae Oh found Ma Dae Young's taxi so we
will be meeting with Detective Hong.

248
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,530
Nice going. A conman revealing
his address to the detective.

249
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,530
Did you make a promise to meet up?
Are you best friends?

250
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,270
Later on, you will probably
confess as a symbol of friendship.

251
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,900
What do you want to say?

252
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,040
Right. You... I know you are
especially fond of Cheong.

253
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,650
But then how long have you been seeing her? It
hasn't been long. It's only been three months.

254
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,320
You and I have been together for ten years.

255
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,850
Are this and that the same?

256
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,450
Three months with Cheong is important but
the ten years with me is rubbish I guess.

257
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,260
I... made a promise with her.
I want to keep that promise.

258
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,060
Didn't you make a promise with me? You said
we'll work together until you find your mom.

259
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,320
Just with that promise,

260
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,230
I took in a runaway teenager whose blood
on his head hadn't even dried.  (really young)

261
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,400
Fed him, clothed him,
housed him and sent him to school!

262
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,440
You are the one mooching off and
living in my house right now.

263
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,970
I was wondering why you didn't mention that.

264
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,080
Anyway, even if you tell me not to leave when the
weather lets up, I was still going to leave.

265
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,810
When was it that I told you that the heater
burst in my room? You didn't even fix it.

266
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,550
Now, I am exhausted from
your indifference towards me.

267
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,720
Sit down.

268
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,650
Hey. There's an old saying,

269
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,790
"Bin-cheon-ji-gyo-bool-ga-mang.
Jo-gang-ji-cheo-bool-ha-dang."

270
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,620
You can't forget friends that you
made when you were low and poor.

271
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,100
You can't throw away your first wife
(who went through hard times with you).

272
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,300
Are you my first wife, Hyung?

273
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,970
No! I'm the friend you made
when you were poor and low.

274
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,600
Hey, let me ask one thing.

275
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,410
If Cheong and I fell into the
water, whom would you save first?

276
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,680
You.

277
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,810
- Really?  - Yeah.

278
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:34,550
If I leave it be, I think Cheong
would save you. I don't like that.

279
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,290
Nevermind me, what about Tae Oh?

280
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,160
You lured him, who was living well in Japan.

281
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,730
You lured him by saying that nowhere
else had faster internet than Korea!

282
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,960
I didn't say anything wrong, though.

283
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,350
What are you going to do about
our simple-minded Tae Oh

284
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,430
who followed us here because of those words,

285
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,470
you irresponsible punk!

286
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,640
Yes, Detective Hong.

287
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,810
Where are you now? I will go out.

288
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,050
Crime Scene Investigator

289
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,120
How did you find what we couldn't
find using our car's black box images

290
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,030
and requesting the assistance of
the control center?

291
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,230
It's skill.

292
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,560
These... for people who hack.

293
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,300
We do our forensic work fair and aboveboard.

294
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,840
Do it then.

295
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,340
For now, we only have your word. Whether Ma Dae
Young drove this, we still don't know that.

296
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,910
Even if we watch the black box video,
it was dark and he was wearing a cap,

297
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,180
so we can't tell who it is.

298
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,920
That's why you're doing fair and
aboveboard forensic work right now.

299
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,550
Something must come out,
be it DNA or fingerprints.

300
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,620
He is soooo despicable.

301
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,760
I ough to! Can I hit him once?

302
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,360
I won't stop you.

303
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,090
We can't find a fingerprint.

304
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:54,400
There aren't even footprints. It seems like the
driver eliminated everything before he ran.

305
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,070
What about any signs of vehicle damage?

306
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,540
There is a section that shows traces
of be scratched during escape.

307
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,410
- What about traces of interior damage?
- There isn't any interior damage.

308
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,110
Okay. Then what about
bloodstains inside the vehicle?

309
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,150
We don't see any bloodstains either.
Who are you? Prosecutor...?

310
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,250
You don't need to mind him.
Didn't anything come out?

311
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,880
Ah, yes.

312
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,920
The only thing that's in the car is this doll.

313
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,690
Octopus. This is yours, right? The one you dropped?

314
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,370
Please take a look at the trash can nearby.

315
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,300
He could have thrown away the clothes he
disguised himself with or the syringe.

316
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,670
Yes.

317
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,410
I warned you. Who are you to command...

318
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,780
- Hospital. - What about the hospital?

319
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,650
Since he abandoned the taxi,
he erased his fingerprints.

320
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,350
Since he fled from the hospital in
haste, he wouldn't have time.

321
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,890
There was a big container filled
with water inside the operating room.

322
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,390
Seeing as how there wasn't much floating matter,

323
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,460
it seemed like water that
had been filled that day.

324
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,760
If Ma Dae Young moved that water container,

325
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,160
there would still be fingerprints
left inside the handle.

326
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:05,040
But then, if that is the case,
why did Ma Dae Young get water?

327
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,810
Out of nowhere.

328
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
You are quitting?

329
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,860
Oh my. Why, Ajumma?
Did I do something that upset you?

330
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,360
No. I just want to rest.

331
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,100
No. It's not easy to find someone
who works as hard as you do.

332
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,900
And at first, honestly,
I thought you had a weird personality.

333
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,840
But I've adjusted to it now.

334
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm sorry. It's because of personal reasons.

335
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,250
Aren't you protesting to have your pay raised?

336
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,950
No. It's not like that.

337
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,120
Aunt, you should step out of this.

338
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,930
No. It seems like she has set her heart
on it, so why hold her back, Unni?

339
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:09,470
Ajumma, even if you leave, at least
work until we get someone to take over.

340
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,870
That is manners.

341
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:17,810
Yes. I will work until you get
someone else. I'm so sorry.

342
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,610
Then, in the meantime,
you are still working, right?

343
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,720
Let's go somewhere after I get off work.

344
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,750
Where?

345
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,460
I will send you the address, you just have
to go there. Would that be alright, Unni?

346
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,960
Agh! That!

347
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,360
Over here.

348
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,630
Oh, my world. How?

349
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,460
- Thank you. - It's okay.

350
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,240
I'm so grateful so I should do something.

351
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,910
No, it's okay.

352
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,440
Then, bye!

353
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,510
Bye.

354
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,420
I met such a wacko.

355
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,710
Ahjummoni, I waited for ten minutes.
Why are you so late?

356
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,810
I'm sorry. I met a pickpocket on the way.

357
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,150
Whose house is this?

358
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,790
My boyfriend-to-be's house.

359
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,760
Since your cooking matches their
taste, I leave it to your care.

360
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,030
Why aren't they opening?

361
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,530
Oh, Miss. Is this your house?

362
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,900
Ahh! Are you Cha Si Ah's mother?

363
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,200
She's not my mother.
She's the ahjummoni working in our house.

364
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,130
But then, how do you know each other?

365
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,010
I told you I met a pickpocket earlier.
She's the one who got my bag back.

366
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,110
Do you also hit pickpockets?

367
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,580
Yeah.

368
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,850
Leave it. I will do it.

369
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,850
That girl, seriously!

370
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,930
As expected, Heo Joon Jae. His room is also clean.

371
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,670
So that is the room that girl lives in?

372
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,620
Joon Jae, these are the files you
asked for regarding Kim Dam Ryeong.

373
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,890
As I looked again when organizing the files, I
think you and Kim Dam Ryeong really look alike.

374
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,430
Is she his mother? She's beautiful.

375
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,990
No. No, she's probably someone who looks like her.

376
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,560
Children's faces are just

377
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,770
like this and that.

378
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,920
Right.

379
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,070
You said that you had the treatment records
for Love Hospital that was closed down, right?

380
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,480
What treatment did Ma Dae Young get from there?

381
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,810
Well, neuropsychiatry.

382
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,850
Because of paranoid delusions
and bipolar disorder,

383
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,850
he used to go once or twice for
treatment and get prescriptions.

384
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,320
When he didn't take his medications, he probably
couldn't control his violent tendencies.

385
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,390
Then he would probably need medication
to be able to live in hiding even now.

386
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,190
If not, how would he be able
to suppress his anger and live?

387
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,530
Well, that could be.

388
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,820
Perhaps among the doctors
who treated Ma Dae Young,

389
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,630
what's the probability of there
being an assistant?

390
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,400
As if. What crazy doctor would
give treatment to a fugitive?

391
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,610
But wouldn't there still be a need to look
into the psychiatric ward medical team?

392
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,180
Right. We'll also check it.

393
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,150
Please stop right up front.

394
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,320
No, not here. Over a bit, there. It's cold outside.

395
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,490
More, more, more.

396
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,830
Then, work hard.

397
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,470
I thought I was escorting a team leader.
Why are we so obedient?

398
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:50,780
It's fake. Heo Joon Jae is just
a bait to catch Ma Dae Young.

399
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,580
We are just using him.

400
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,620
Why do I always feel that that is not the case?

401
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,860
Now tell me about Joon Jae's mother.

402
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,050
I also don't know well.

403
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,230
They got separated when he was ten, and he's
been looking for her until now. That's about it.

404
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,940
I don't know where she has been hiding well.

405
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,470
She's going around and not
leaving traces so I can't find her.

406
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,010
I want to find her. Where is she?

407
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,540
I really have confidence I could do well.

408
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,020
Is that so?

409
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,280
- Nuclear taste.  - What?

410
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,790
You don't know. It's something
people in the internet use a lot.

411
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,090
Nuclear taste. It means it's totally delicious.

412
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,490
Anyway, it's a relief since
you're saying it's delicious.

413
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,230
Oh my. When is your boyfriend coming?
I'm almost done.

414
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,140
Whose boyfriend? Perhaps Heo!

415
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,570
Should we go now?

416
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,740
Oh my, what's wrong with you, Cha Si Ah?

417
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,980
Right now?

418
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,880
Yes. Right now. Let's go now.

419
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,190
- I'm going. - Please leave.

420
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,660
Bye.

421
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,380
Let's go. Go straight.

422
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,280
A little bit more.

423
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,550
- Go on. - Oh my, I can open it myself.

424
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,360
There's an urgent matter. Get in, please.

425
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,080
Elizabeth.

426
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,780
Who do you take after

427
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,120
that you still can't do the multiplication
table after ten months? Really!

428
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,330
- I'm back. - Yes.

429
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,370
What should I do with you? Truly.

430
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,370
- Unni. - You're here.

431
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,870
Solve it. What are you doing?

432
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,310
- Where did you go with Ajumma?
- You said Ajummoni has a son, right?

433
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,410
Yes, why?

434
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,240
Have you heard anything about her son?

435
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,110
Well...

436
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,320
Her son is so good looking and, oh!

437
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,290
He went to KAIST.

438
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,230
No. They don't keep in touch.

439
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,600
After she got divorced they lived apart and just
heard news from each other from time to time.

440
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,370
What's wrong?

441
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,840
Ajummoni, are you teaching me now?

442
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,610
Unni, why is she like that? Are you my mother-in-law?

443
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,810
Oh my! It seems like I'm in talks for marriage.

444
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:15,510
No. It seems like she has set her heart
on it, so why hold her back, Unni?

445
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,220
No, no.

446
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,020
What's wrong with her?

447
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,530
Why does 6x6 = 40? Aren't you
going to get your head straight!

448
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,110
Ji Yong's aunt.

449
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,240
What are you doing in my room again?

450
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,280
That... Perhaps...

451
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,120
That picture.

452
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,150
Is he your son?

453
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,760
That's right.

454
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,100
Your son doesn't look like his mom.

455
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,370
What do you mean?
People always said he looked like me.

456
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,840
What's wrong?

457
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,680
I have thought about this... until now, Ajummoni—

458
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,580
Madam... Can I call you mother?

459
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,250
Why am I your mother?

460
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,790
Strictly speaking, you're not my mother.
You're not but

461
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:34,160
you seem like my mother or could be my mother.

462
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,430
- Are you sick?,- No, I'm not sick.

463
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:42,670
It seems like I was sick before.
Until now, I was not in my right mind.

464
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,810
Now rather, I have got back to my senses.

465
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,280
My throat is so dry.
Can you get me a glass of water, Mother?

466
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,380
No, no. Would you like a glass of water?
Should I get you one?

467
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,950
No. I'm fine.

468
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,460
- I will get you water. - No, no!

469
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,430
That is... The truth is...

470
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:13,000
What's wrong? Do you have something to say to me?

471
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,940
Just a little... Just a little later...

472
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,870
I will tell you just a little later.

473
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:24,040
I'm so sorry.

474
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,080
Mother.

475
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,320
What's with her?

476
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:50,000
What's with you, Heo Joon Jae? You always
told me "Hey, upper room, come down."

477
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,170
Aren't you cold? When I looked
earlier this side was a bit windy.

478
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,440
- If it's cold, you can sleep downstairs.
- With you?

479
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,180
I will sleep up here.

480
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,180
No. It's not cold.

481
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,320
- I have something I am curious about. - Yeah.

482
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,060
You... The day you were taken by Ma Dae Young.

483
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,030
Yeah.

484
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:21,730
By any chance, did that guy fill a tub with water?

485
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,600
Yeah.

486
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,070
Why?

487
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,710
Ma Dae Young knows.

488
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,980
That I am a mermaid.

489
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,650
He said he saw it in a dream and
wanted to personally confirm it.

490
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,620
But, Heo Joon Jae,

491
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,720
I can't tell you this.

492
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,320
Don't.

493
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,660
If it's something that's hard to say

494
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,060
you don't have to force yourself to say it.

495
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,470
I'm scared since that person
has found out my secret.

496
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,780
You don't have to be scared.

497
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,380
Nothing will happen.

498
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,820
Nothing will repeat itself.

499
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,120
Whatever happened before

500
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,320
will not happen this time.

501
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,730
I will make it so.

502
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,350
Honey.

503
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,090
Seo Hee.

504
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,230
Honey!

505
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Seo Hee.

506
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,150
Father!

507
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,350
Father.

508
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,740
Secretary Kim, please come here.

509
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,610
Father...

510
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,240
collapsed.

511
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,630
He had a lot of cerebral hemorrhage due
to external wounds when he came to the ER.

512
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,400
But the surgery went well.

513
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,200
Thank you.

514
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,140
Are regular daily activities still possible?

515
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,210
We would need to observe
after he wakes up from anesthesia

516
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,610
and regains consciousness
so we won't know for now.

517
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,080
I think your father is looking for you.

518
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,050
For a moment.

519
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,460
Father.

520
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,000
Joon Jae.

521
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,270
Yes, Father.

522
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,040
Joon Jae.

523
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,680
- Joon Jae. - Father...

524
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,280
Joon Jae.

525
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,250
Joon Jae.

526
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,250
Joon Jae.

527
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,000
Joon Jae.

528
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:25,500
The sunken boat with the belongings of Kim Dam
Ryeong seemed like it was on the way to exile.

529
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,840
It seems that on the way to exile,
he died after the ship sank.

530
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,580
They must have met a heavy rainstorm.

531
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,150
Sea in Front of Yangyang, Kim Dam Ryeong
Shipwreck Excavation of Artifacts Report

532
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,420
So, did you protect her well there?

533
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,390
Why aren't you sleeping?

534
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,800
- Heo Joon Jae, I think I know. - What?

535
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,730
Honestly, today I found out a lot.

536
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,940
Men fall for women who may seem
easy but are actually hard to get.

537
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,940
What is that exactly? Seems easy but hard.

538
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,140
They accept date offers but refuse skinship.

539
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,310
Why? Such a good thing. Why refuse it?

540
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,980
So annoying.

541
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,150
You should refuse the second time.

542
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,190
Refuse the second time but
say okay on the third? Why?

543
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,790
First love to a man is?

544
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,530
Branding

545
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,630
I heard that first love to
a man is like being branded.

546
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,570
Once it has been stamped on your
heart, it will never go away.

547
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,730
First love?

548
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,340
To you, Se Hwa is your first love.

549
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,840
Ah... it's not necessarily like that.

550
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,210
No, it's okay.

551
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:41,910
Since Se Hwa has left such a big stamp on your
heart, that is why you had such a sad dream.

552
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,920
- That's not it... - But I also found out that

553
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,120
a man's first love does not come true.

554
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,460
So I will let that girl Se
Hwa stamp the "first love."

555
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,060
It would have been a big trouble
if I were your first love.

556
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,560
It almost wouldn't have worked out for us.

557
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,460
- Why? - Why?

558
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,100
I told you to get Heo Joon Jae, but you almost got
caught while you were taking some other girl?

559
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,230
And you're not answering your phone.

560
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,970
- Ji Yeon.- Get your head straight. Who's Ji Yeon?

561
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,610
I am Kang Seo Hee.

562
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,810
I had a dream.

563
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,280
What?

564
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,680
In my dream, I saw my past life.

565
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,580
You might not believe it but it's true.

566
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:56,560
In my dream, Heo Joon Jae was in there and you too.

567
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,260
And that woman too.

568
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,760
That woman... is that the one you kidnapped?

569
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,800
Yeah. It's true.

570
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:12,170
In that dream, that woman... was a mermaid.

571
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,540
You're not taking medication these days, right?
That's because you're not taking medication.

572
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,110
Right, right. You might not believe
it, but I'm going crazy.

573
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,650
I seem like a lunatic.

574
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:27,120
But then, that dream is so
vivid that I'm going crazy.

575
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,160
Now, we're almost there. CEO Heo is almost settled.

576
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,860
If you can just take care of Joon Jae,

577
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:39,200
Chi Hyeon, you, and I...
The three of us can live happily.

578
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,170
We have been waiting a long time for this day.

579
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:50,110
Please get your head straight
and take your medications.

580
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,450
Stop talking about that strange dream.

581
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,680
Yeah.

582
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,860
After that, I sometimes dreamed
but it didn't mesh well.

583
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:12,700
And then one day,
suddenly a strange scene came to mind.

584
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,640
Ma Dae Young, starting from 2009,

585
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,110
went once every few months, irregularly.

586
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,640
The person he went to the most
to get treatment is this person.

587
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,480
Professor Jin Gyeong Won.

588
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,980
Professor Jin Gyeong Won

589
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,530
So, do you want to see the end of that dream?

590
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,400
If that person so desperately

591
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,570
has a story he wants to tell me,

592
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,640
then the last... I would have to see it through.

593
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,480
Seeing that could somehow
create serious trauma for you.

594
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,910
Would that still be okay?

595
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
Yes.

596
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,640
Department of Neuropsychiatry
Professor Jin Gyeong Won

597
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,950
My request, don't forget.

598
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,690
Look here.

599
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:46,190
If you leave such a request, how will I live?

600
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,360
When will we be able to see each other again?

601
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,530
What date is today?

602
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,400
December 15th.

603
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,000
December 11th of the same year,

604
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:03,580
At the young age of 27, he died?

605
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,810
Even when I knew the future,
it just got delayed a little.

606
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,950
I see that I can't change it with my own strength.

607
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,990
Since the day for us to meet again is set,

608
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,230
we will meet again.

609
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,360
As good friends.

610
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,620
You need to set off now.

611
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,390
It's a relief that it's you.

612
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,890
I don't think about personal relations.

613
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,730
I am just doing what I have to.

614
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,630
It's now. Cast it!

615
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,550
Please turn the boat around.

616
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,120
What did you say?

617
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,890
Turn it around. There is something I must do.

618
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,290
It's impossible.

619
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:15,890
The life of the person whom I
love the most depends on it.

620
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,830
I am sorry, but it is impossible.

621
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,230
I also can't help it.

622
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,880
I promise, once the thing I must do is done

623
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,120
I will continue to my own path. I ask of you.

624
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,720
If I can't protect that person, then
there would be no reason for me to live.

625
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:59,600
Stand back. This person

626
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,910
has saved my father who was falsely accused.

627
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:12,650
Didn't I say to stand back! I will take
responsibility so turn the boat around.

628
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:35,010
Did we catch her? Look properly
to see if we have caught her.

629
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,750
Shoot arrows or throw a harpoon. Even
if you kill her, you have to catch her!

630
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,840
Whoever catches her
will be given enough reward

631
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,890
to live comfortably for the rest of his life!

632
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,230
Yes!

633
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,030
Catch her!

634
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,320
Jeez! Give it to me!

635
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:54,120
Aigoo! Who do we have here! Isn't it the Village—

636
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,220
Isn't it the former Village Head
that has been exiled for his crime?

637
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,520
Stop!

638
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,950
It seems like you still
haven't grasped the situation.

639
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,960
Where do you get the nerve to
command one to stop or not

640
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,800
when you are a criminal!

641
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,370
This is Officer Kim Hyeon
from the Royal Investigation Bureau.

642
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,340
What strange things are you doing here?

643
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:17,540
A hunter hunts in the mountains,
and a fisherman fishes in the sea.

644
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,880
It's not a strange thing.

645
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,650
It's blood! Blood! It's blood!

646
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,760
What are you doing! Shoot arrows
and throw harpoons and catch it!

647
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,620
Yes!

648
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,530
Se Hwa!

649
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:15,490
♬ I'm still dreaming. ♬

650
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:23,200
♬ The indistinct thought of someone who was ♬

651
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:31,080
♬ as radiant as the moonlight
in the pale evening sky ♬

652
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:38,420
♬ is evoked. ♬

653
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:45,720
♬ On the petals floating in the wind ♬

654
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:53,300
♬ I sense your warm fragrance and ♬

655
00:55:53,300 --> 00:56:01,040
♬ our connection which was brief ♬

656
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:08,710
♬ and passed by now is my everything. ♬

657
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:16,920
♬ I am afraid being under the
same sky together with you ♬

658
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:24,100
♬ will be erased. ♬

659
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:31,640
♬ If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon ♬

660
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:39,880
♬ I won't let go of your hand. ♬

661
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,040
You live on land, and I live in the water.

662
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:09,780
Will the heaven we go to after
we die be the same or different?

663
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:17,420
The heaven that we will go to after
we die will be the same place.

664
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,690
Heaven doesn't have a distinction
between water and land.

665
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,290
You know, Dam Ryeong.

666
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:33,370
If perhaps, we get to meet later in another place

667
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:37,340
I wish you would be you and I would be me.

668
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,910
That way, I can recognize you.

669
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:53,490
That will be the case. If we do meet again

670
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:58,020
you will be you and I will be me.

671
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:02,860
Will we be able to remember
what we are talking about now?

672
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,510
I promise, even if we are to be born again,

673
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:25,580
I will find you, meet you,
become devoted to you, and protect you.

674
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:32,860
Our conversation right now...
I will remember it for sure.

675
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:52,480
♬ I am afraid being under the
same sky together with you ♬

676
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:59,920
♬ will be erased. ♬

677
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:06,930
♬ If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon ♬

678
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:14,630
♬ I won't let go of your hand. ♬

679
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:23,140
♬ I am afraidl being under the
same sky together with you ♬

680
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:30,620
♬ will be erased. ♬

681
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:38,490
♬ If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon ♬
