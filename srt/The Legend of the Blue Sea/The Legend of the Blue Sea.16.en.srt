1
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,980
Heo Joon Jae,
the legend of the lighthouse was true.

2
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,860
That those who part at the
lighthouse always meet again.

3
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,090
That they meet and love again.

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,870
Congratulations, you're going to meet your mom.

5
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,260
Joon Jae...

6
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,060
Mom...

7
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,200
Joon Jae...

8
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,780
Joon Jae... I'm sorry.

9
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,290
I'm sorry, Joon Jae.

10
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,300
I'm sorry.

11
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,110
I'm so sorry... I'm sorry.

12
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,810
Sorry...

13
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,930
Mom is sorry... I'm so sorry...

14
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,380
Among the many words I've come
to learn after coming here,

15
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,490
the best words are "happy ending."

16
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,330
I'm sure that this very moment is a happy ending.

17
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,630
But the hope and despair
that life gives you is that

18
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,600
time keeps flowing and the moment passes.

19
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
Behind that moment of brilliant happiness,

20
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,340
no one knows what kind of moments await.

21
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,660
The Legend of the Blue Sea

22
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,870
Episode 16

23
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,110
How is your... health?

24
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,380
You're not hurting anywhere?

25
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,210
How about you?

26
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,220
I'm okay.

27
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,990
I'm sorry.

28
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,690
Stop saying... that you're sorry.

29
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,500
I shouldn't have...

30
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,130
left you behind there like that.

31
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,370
I thought your wealthy
father would raise you well.

32
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,680
I thought you were living
well while studying abroad.

33
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,310
I didn't go to study abroad,
but I did live well enough.

34
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,420
I met nice people, too.

35
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,320
I heard you ran away from home
when you were in high school.

36
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,890
Why did you do that?
Why didn't you just endure and live there?

37
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,830
Because I missed you.

38
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,040
I missed you so much.

39
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,010
I thought I could find you right away.

40
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,510
But

41
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,190
you were nowhere to be found.
I've thought of all kinds of things.

42
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,790
Could she have passed away?

43
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,100
So, please stop saying you are sorry.

44
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,640
For living healthily like this,

45
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,010
I am thankful.

46
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,580
But my mom became so small.

47
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,620
When I was little, you always embraced me.

48
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,720
I should embrace you every day.

49
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,760
How difficult must it have been for you

50
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,170
for a ten-year-old cry baby to grow this much.

51
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,270
For such a long time, you were alone without Mom.

52
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,980
My son, how difficult must it have been for you.

53
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,150
How lonely would you have been?

54
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,890
Mommy had no idea...

55
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,130
That's why

56
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,470
you can't go anywhere anymore.

57
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,800
When we are apart, you don't know anything.

58
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,240
So, don't go anywhere.

59
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,690
Really? The ahjumma that works
at Si Ah's is Joon Jae's mom?

60
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,890
Yeah, so the two of them are talking right now.

61
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,230
It's not just Joon Jae who has been searching for
his mom. I've also searched for her everywhere.

62
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,070
But I can't believe she was right here all along!

63
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,340
It's something to congratulate them for,

64
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,910
but what about your birthday party?
It's a little ambiguous now.

65
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,140
That's true. Why did you make it today of all days?

66
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,950
It's because I picked the right
date that Heo Joon Jae met his mom.

67
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,650
That's true, too. Not only are you better at
speaking, you've become perfectly logical, too.

68
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,050
The plate's empty over here.

69
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,100
What is it?

70
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,210
Oh, it's nothing.

71
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,810
This place doesn't refill very well.

72
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,010
Other parties never let the dishes go empty.

73
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,360
This is driving me crazy. What is this?

74
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,130
I'm sure there's something. Something huge.

75
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,700
I couldn't have dreamed that
this was the house you lived in.

76
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,940
I didn't know either. All this time,
I have been eating the food that you made

77
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,570
and just thought it tasted similar.
I couldn't have dreamed that you made it.

78
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,380
Whose house is this?

79
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,250
The house of my boyfriend... or will be.

80
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,620
By chance, is Ji Yong's aunt,
Cha Si Ah, your girlfriend?

81
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,130
What? No, she's not. She's just my college classmate.

82
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,300
Right? It's Cheong, right?

83
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,800
Omo, look at how you smile. You like her that much?

84
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,840
But, you're already living together?

85
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,910
She doesn't have a suitable place
to go because of her circumstances.

86
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,790
Fate is such a strange thing.
I've received help from Cheong many times.

87
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,730
She helped me when I got pick-pocketed,

88
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,790
and she also saved me from getting hit by
a car when I was walking while distracted.

89
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,720
How did you almost get hit by a car?

90
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,200
You and Cheong both. Don't you think
about getting out of the way of a car?

91
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,670
Be careful. Please.

92
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,840
Okay, I got it.

93
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,370
But, how can you afford to
live in such a nice house?

94
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,310
I earned a lot of money, although this is a rental.

95
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,750
I can at least get a place
for us to live in together.

96
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,520
So, stop working so hard and live with me.

97
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,620
What kind of work do you do, Joon Jae?

98
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,660
Just... this and that.

99
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,570
Let's go in.

100
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:38,240
♬ Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you,

101
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:46,050
♬ To our beloved Shim Cheong, Happy Birthday!

102
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,760
- Did you make a wish?  - Oh, a wish.

103
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,790
I want to live here happily for
a long time with Heo Joon Jae.

104
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,730
A wish should be made in your heart for it to come
true. If you say it aloud, it won't come true.

105
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,640
Really? Oh, what do I do?

106
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,340
It's okay. It'll come true even if you
say it aloud. Blow the candles out.

107
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,580
Wait.

108
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,820
- Let's blow out the candles once more.  - Why?

109
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,950
There's another thing to congratulate.
You and your mom found each other.

110
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,880
Wait. That is... Is there anyone
else who needs to be congratulated?

111
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,950
Me. I did get a hundred on
my English vocabulary test.

112
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,220
Oh, we should congratulate her.
Let's blow it out one more time, huh?

113
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,850
You're doing this because
you think it's fun, right?

114
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,360
Yeah.

115
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,690
Let's do it. It's not hard to do.

116
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,630
Okay, let's. Where is it?

117
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,440
Congratulations.

118
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,110
- Wait.  - Again?

119
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,140
Stop it, stop!

120
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,310
- What?  - You come over, too.

121
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,920
- No, right before that. - Didn't you hear me?

122
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,980
I said Joon Jae found his mom.

123
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,490
Not only that, she's the
ahjumma who works in your house.

124
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,920
Things like this really do happen in the world!

125
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,930
Isn't this a good thing for you?

126
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,100
You must be really close since
you lived in the same house.

127
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,800
Just come over. There's a big party going on.

128
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,200
Even a grade schooler and a bum are here.

129
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,980
Anyway, just come.

130
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,780
What do I do?

131
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,620
Let's go. I'll take you home. Your hand.

132
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,290
Get home safe. Thank you for
coming to my birthday party.

133
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,490
Unni, happy birthday.

134
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,960
You too, Oppa,
congratulations on finding your mom.

135
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,100
Yeah. Thanks, kid.

136
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,910
Thank you.

137
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,680
Bye.

138
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,990
By the way, aren't you giving me a goodie bag?

139
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,360
- A what bag?  - A goodie bag. Party favors.

140
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,730
When I go to parties, they always give those out.

141
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,830
Do you want me to pack you up some food?

142
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,130
I don't eat food that's two
hours past when it was cooked.

143
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,500
Oh, I see. Go back safely.

144
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,680
Hey, what's wrong with all your friends?

145
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,610
Aren't there any normal ones?

146
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,650
Why? I like them. I like all the friends I made here.

147
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,920
Heo Joon Jae's mom is my friend, too.

148
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,760
Hey, how is my mom your friend?

149
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,790
It's true. We are friends.

150
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,900
See that? We're friends.

151
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,000
Hey, if you're friends with my
mom, where does that leave me?

152
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,210
Ah, this house is becoming more and more strange.

153
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,350
Mother, you don't know how hard I searched for you.

154
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,490
I've got all of your old addresses memorized, and
I know all of your friends and relatives, too.

155
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,460
I see. I was overseas for
several years after the divorce,

156
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,790
and after going through all my
savings and coming back,

157
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,900
I've just been taking care of
other people's households.

158
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,270
- So it would have been hard to find me.  - Aigoo...

159
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,900
You must have been through a lot.

160
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,200
Shall we toast in light of that?

161
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,940
Cheers.

162
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,180
But Mother, since the emotional reunion has

163
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,820
died down a little, could I ask you something?

164
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,690
Yes. What is it?

165
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,730
Do you by any chance know
someone named Kang Ji Hyun?

166
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,060
You went to the same high school.

167
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,330
- Kang... Ji Hyun?  - Yes.

168
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,340
Is she someone you know?

169
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,540
Why are you asking?

170
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,640
Well, there was an issue,

171
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,280
so we've been looking into Kang Ji Hyun.

172
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,420
Her resident ID has been canceled
and there's no record of her at all.

173
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,430
She is someone I know. Whom I know all too well.

174
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,790
- Really?  - Yeah.

175
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,860
You know her, too.

176
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,300
I... know her?

177
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,170
Joon Jae, she's your stepmother.

178
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,350
Huh? What?

179
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,820
But... that's not her name.

180
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,920
She told me she changed her name to Kang Seo Hee.

181
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,020
She changed her name?

182
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,390
Then there would have been some
kind of record left, but there wasn't anything.

183
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:31,460
I don't know about all that, but her name in school
was Kang Ji Hyun. I'm sure of at least that much.

184
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,400
Kang Ji Hyun was that woman?

185
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,370
What is it? What's wrong?

186
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,870
- The thing is—  - No, it's nothing.

187
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,110
What is it? What's wrong?

188
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,850
Mother, do you know an escapee named Ma Dae Young?

189
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,620
I think I've heard the name.

190
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,720
You see, we've been trying to track Ma Dae Young.

191
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,460
But Kang Ji Hyun seems to be
a bit related to Ma Dae Young.

192
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,030
Related how?

193
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,770
- That is—  - That's enough.

194
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,640
It's nothing much.
The detective we know was asking about it.

195
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,090
What are you doing?

196
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,700
Joon Jae's mother is i-inside, right?

197
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,330
Probably.

198
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,200
By any chance, did she say anything about... me?

199
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,870
- What kind of things?  - Never mind.

200
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,410
Aren't you going in?

201
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,280
Tae Ho, do you want to have a drink with me?

202
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,050
I... don't want to drink with you, Noona.

203
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,020
Come on, let's have a drink.

204
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,760
I don't know how much you like me,

205
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,600
but do you want me to make
you dislike me altogether?

206
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,740
I... knew that that ahjumma was Joon Jae's mother.

207
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,270
So why didn't you say anything?

208
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,040
I... have been really awful to her,

209
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,710
so we didn't get along at all.

210
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,050
But then I found out... that she's his mother.

211
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:39,690
So I tried to restore my relationship
with her somehow and then tell him,

212
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,260
but everything is all over now. Once he finds out,

213
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,670
he won't even want to be friends with me,
right? He'll tell me to get lost, right?

214
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,940
I know that I'm a horrible bitch.

215
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,140
How do you feel? After hearing this,

216
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,640
any feelings you had for me
disappeared completely, right?

217
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,950
Be thankful.

218
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,490
My wish is for my feelings for
Joon Jae to disappear completely.

219
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,250
But because I can't help it,
it's made it so difficult for me.

220
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm telling you so that you won't suffer like me.

221
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,330
Your ardent feelings for me, that
love, I'm telling you to throw it away.

222
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,710
Yes. Kang Ji Hyun, whom my mother
knows, is my stepmother.

223
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,850
If she is still related to Ma Dae Young...

224
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,350
So you're saying that the reason
Ma Dae Young has been after you could be

225
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,820
because your stepmother instigated it?

226
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,290
But why? Why would he try to kill you?

227
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,360
I'm sure that Heo Joon Jae bastard
did something bad to annoy her.

228
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,300
Father's will and testament was notarized,

229
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,300
but he left almost all of his assets to me and mom.

230
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,710
The first thing I can say is that
it would be over inheritance.

231
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,510
Inheritance? How much wealth could there
be that she'd go that far to harm you?

232
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,480
What?

233
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,250
Rascal. You're conning me again! Stop!

234
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,590
You're going to get it. Is your father a Chaebol?

235
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,360
What?

236
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,330
Really?

237
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,970
Is that important right now?
Can't you subpoena him right away?

238
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,570
We can't do it without any crucial proof.

239
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,570
And that could alert her
that we're suspecting her,

240
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,380
so we have to careful until we find some proof.

241
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,180
I'm telling you, I have a sense about this.
The puzzle is coming together.

242
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,710
And we don't have time to wait either.

243
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,880
What are you going to do now?

244
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,520
I'm going to do it my way.

245
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,950
I'm going to find proof and
reveal everything as soon as possible.

246
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,630
Fortunately, he was in the state of being
able to breathe on his own a little.

247
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,100
It happened when he was using the
breathing machine only as a support.

248
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,600
So there was no fatal cardiac arrest.

249
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,410
He nearly died once. How could
something like this happen again?

250
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,810
I don't know if he'll be able to live
a normal life even if he wakes up...

251
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:18,620
In this patient's case,
he has a diffuse axonal injury.

252
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:24,760
In cases like his, sometimes the patient
can suddenly wake up from a coma.

253
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,460
Since we don't know the exact process
by which an injured brain recovers,

254
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,630
we just call it a miracle.

255
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,700
I hope for a miracle, Doctor.

256
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,490
What's the matter, Chi Hyeon?

257
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,220
Is he my father?

258
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,060
Ma Dae Young?

259
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,630
- Is he?  - Must I confirm it for you?

260
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,740
Yes.

261
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,440
I don't understand, Chi Hyeon.

262
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,080
Without knowing anything,
without doing anything,

263
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,980
if you just sit and wait, I'll do
everything for you, so why are you curious?

264
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,750
The fact that I'm the son of someone like him!

265
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,120
I hate it so much.

266
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,230
Because then, it makes me feel
like a clump of dirty moss

267
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,130
that can never go out into the sunlight.

268
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,800
Chi Hyeon.

269
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,410
I used to have...

270
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,610
a twin sister.

271
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,750
We were born in the same hour, same day,
and we were placed in the same basket

272
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,690
and thrown away at an orphanage. My sister

273
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,660
got adopted to a really nice home, but not me.

274
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,600
A father who got violent whenever he drank

275
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:54,010
and a pathetic mother...
Being dirt poor with no future in sight.

276
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,210
Even in that circumstance, there was
still one thing that worked for me.

277
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,150
I don't know.

278
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,830
Just... I thought my father
was sleeping after drinking

279
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,660
but when I woke up in the morning...

280
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,800
Don't cry.

281
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,410
Honey...

282
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,010
if you go like this,
how am I supposed to live on my own?

283
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,550
Take me with you!

284
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:47,630
People seemed to trust whatever
a powerless person said.

285
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,530
Coming this far while using
that as my sole weapon,

286
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,170
it was a long and difficult road.

287
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,210
Chi Hyeon...

288
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:15,850
I didn't want you to take a longer way around.

289
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:21,530
Whether it's Ma Dae Young or Heo Il
Joong, they're only just shortcuts.

290
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,900
Just take that shortcut and
go out into that sunlight.

291
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,640
And go live as not a clump of moss but as a flower.

292
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,980
That's all you have to do.

293
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,940
Thanks for walking me home.

294
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,320
- Noona.  - Yeah.

295
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,090
I thought about it, and I will stop liking you now.

296
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,930
What? Oh, has it been sorted out?

297
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,100
- Yes, it has. - Already?

298
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,830
Oh, really? That's good. I'm glad.

299
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,040
So Noona, you should confess
to Hung Joon Jae properly, too.

300
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,370
In this situation? How can I?

301
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,340
What if I can never see him again?

302
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,580
Is there any meaning in
continuing to see him like this?

303
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,220
I'll be going.

304
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,890
What? How can he sort out his feelings so quickly?

305
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:04,460
Well... That's good then.

306
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,500
Yes, it happened that way. I'll come
home after sleeping here overnight.

307
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,540
Omo, so you met your son?

308
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,880
What a dramatic reunion!

309
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,080
Omo, so how did you find him?

310
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,180
Oh, I see.

311
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,060
- Tell me about that thing earlier.  - What?

312
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,230
About what kind of relationship Heo Joon
Jae's stepmother has with Ma Dae Young.

313
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,990
Why are you curious about it?

314
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:40,370
Ma Dae Young tried to hurt me
and Heo Joon Jae, both of us.

315
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,200
Ma Dae Young had just one woman in
his life and that is Kang Ji Hyun.

316
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,670
And surrounding her are mysterious deaths.

317
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,600
And her adoptive family members all

318
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,010
had suspicious myocardial infarctions,
suicides, accidents...

319
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:01,290
After both of her husbands losing their
vision, they died of illness and accident.

320
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,920
You don't understand what
I'm saying right now, do you?

321
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,030
No, I understand everything. You know
I watch the news diligently these days.

322
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,830
Anyway, Kang Ji Hyun could have had a child,

323
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,670
but we couldn't find anyone
since there was no record.

324
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:20,140
But if Kang Ji Hyun is Joon Jae's stepmother,
then who is that, that kid, Heo Chi Hyeon,

325
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,380
Joon Jae's step brother could be the child.

326
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,480
What's with your expression?

327
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,450
Just that... I feel like Heo
Joon Jae was very lonely.

328
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,490
Well, he could have been.

329
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,860
But it could have been a blessing that
he met me after running away from home.

330
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,260
That household is really chilling somehow...

331
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,330
If you find out anything
else, make sure to tell me.

332
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,140
What help would she be if she
heard anything else from me?

333
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,210
Ah... That day at this pool,

334
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,550
I'm sure there was something.

335
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,150
Cry.

336
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,760
Cry? Why did I ask her to cry?

337
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,820
Ah... tears...

338
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,130
Tears...?

339
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,900
This is my room.

340
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,500
Omo, it's cozy and pretty.

341
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,670
Can I sleep here with you tonight?

342
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,170
Of course.

343
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,770
Huh?

344
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,070
To My Beloved Fool,

345
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,250
you went through so much to come and
be beside me, and I'm thankful that you came.

346
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:41,990
From now on, I'll make it so that you only
wear pretty shoes and walk on nice paths.

347
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,870
Omo! Omo!

348
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,080
Omo! You finally came to our house!

349
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,180
Joon Jae gave them to you?

350
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,260
Because you're here like this next to Joon Jae,

351
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,830
I'm thankful and I feel relieved.

352
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:27,270
Me, too. I'm so thankful and relieved that
you came to be with Heo Joon Jae, too.

353
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:33,040
But... If something happens and I'm
not next to Heo Joon Jae anymore,

354
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,610
please stay with him and don't go anywhere, okay?

355
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,710
Huh? Something like what?

356
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,050
I'm just saying in case...

357
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,970
Heo Joon Jae, thank you for the presents.

358
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,260
Why are you still up?

359
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,200
It's my birthday today, but I didn't
really get to see your face properly.

360
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,110
Open the door.

361
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,880
♬ Friends say I've changed a bit♬

362
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,020
♬ The style of clothes I wear and
even the type of coffee I like♬

363
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,720
♬ It's not something which is fabricated.♬

364
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,130
♬ What's coming out sounds like you. ♬

365
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:09,330
Since you saw my face, go to sleep.
Stop making noise.

366
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,670
When I watched TV, a kiss was a must on a birthday.

367
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,510
♬ Every day one by one♬

368
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,410
- Hey! - Why?

369
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:24,620
Come here.
♬ Love is still a clumsy feeling♬

370
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:31,920
♬ I must still be filling
up cautiously with you♬

371
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,060
♬ Look here even now I'm holding you♬

372
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,170
♬ Like in a dream, I'm embracing you.♬

373
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,510
Are you going to give me a birthday kiss?

374
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,840
- What?  - I'm ready.

375
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,220
Aigoo.

376
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,690
What is this?

377
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,860
Hey, Delinquent Mermaid, you were going
on about romantic love and whatnot before,

378
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,590
but you keep going towards the dirty kind.

379
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:10,130
What do you mean dirty love?
Over this? Are you kidding?

380
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,600
I wanted to warn you before, too,

381
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,500
but please don't think so much
before falling asleep at night.

382
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,100
It's so noisy for me!

383
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,440
So shameful. Eavesdropping on my thoughts.

384
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,280
Who did that? I don't want to hear it either.

385
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,250
You keep blabbering on,
and that's why I can hear you.

386
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,450
I told you many times before, but I live in a
house because I don't like floor to floor noise.

387
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,250
Your blabbering from the floor
above me is giving me insomnia!

388
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,530
I get it Downstairs Mister. So did you
ask me to see you to complain about noise?

389
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,930
Of course not.

390
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,660
Then why?

391
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,270
To do this.

392
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,170
Today I have to check and see
if your heart's beating well.

393
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,280
But... it doesn't seem to be beating that great.

394
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,680
Really? I think it's beating just fine.

395
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,300
Now it is.

396
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,950
Oh, it shocked me so much
that I couldn't even sleep.

397
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,520
So did your son grow up well?

398
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,450
Yes. I think so.

399
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:48,090
Oh, that's a relief. Now you can hold
his hand and just go live with him now.

400
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,530
Why would I in that house?

401
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,470
But Joon Jae should go
back to his rightful place.

402
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,700
Omo, where are you going in the middle of our talk?

403
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,600
To make dinner.

404
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,410
Oh, what do you mean? Never mind!

405
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:05,780
Just order something today.
Don't be like that and tell me more, Unni.

406
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,110
Instead,

407
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,050
why don't we have some tea
and have a conversation?

408
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,390
Do you want some coffee maybe?

409
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,560
Green plum tea.

410
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,360
Oh, that sounds good.
Okay, green plum tea. Green plum.

411
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,100
Unni, where do we keep the plum extract?

412
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,160
In the refrigerator on the second shelf.

413
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,370
Ah, that's right. In the second shelf.

414
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,240
Second shelf.

415
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,410
No, not there. Inside.

416
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,210
Oh!

417
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,280
- Shall I do it?  - No, no. I found it.

418
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,650
Do you think I can't make it for you? Seriously.

419
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,120
Oh, honey, you're home. I told you, right?

420
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,250
She found her son.

421
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,920
Oh, right. Congratulations.

422
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,220
Yes, thank you so much.

423
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,830
But, why did you—

424
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:59,300
It's cold, and it's too hard on you
to go to the market without a car.

425
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,230
So since it's his free day,
I asked him to go get groceries instead.

426
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,700
Oh, seriously. That's too much for you to do.

427
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,850
Why? Is it no good?

428
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:21,850
Vegetables are a bit wilted...and
there's too much fat on the meat.

429
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,920
Seriously, I knew you would do this.
Can't you shop well?!

430
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,990
I'm sorry. I just took whatever they gave me.

431
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,860
Oh, it's okay.
It's understandable since you're a man.

432
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,900
I'll go and try to exchange them.

433
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,540
Seriously. You're making more work for Unni!

434
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,500
I'm sorry.

435
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,810
Seriously, I can't live.

436
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,410
Yes?

437
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,750
Ji Yong's aunt?

438
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,350
Yes, c-come in.

439
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,630
You knew all along, right? That Joon Jae's my son.

440
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:06,100
That is, I was going to tell him...

441
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,030
Are you going to tell Joon Jae?

442
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,380
No, I'm not. I heard that you've
been a good friend to him.

443
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:23,020
Thank you. From now on, too, please do the same.

444
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,520
Yes. I'll be sure to. Mother, thank you.

445
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,360
What do you mean, Mother? Don't be
like this and be how you were before.

446
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,830
Then get some rest.

447
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:46,770
She smiled when she talked to
me, so why do I feel so uneasy?

448
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,610
Did she just draw the line?
Between Joon Jae and me?

449
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,800
Where is Father?

450
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
Go on ahead.

451
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,770
Is that the president's real son?

452
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,510
Not sure. I think so.

453
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,340
What are you doing here?

454
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,480
Is he here at the company?

455
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,650
I told you before.
He went on a vacation with his friends.

456
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,320
Really? To where?

457
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,690
To get some rest, he went to Hawaii.

458
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,960
Hawaii... He's been away for a while now.
Because of food,

459
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,600
he doesn't stay longer than a week abroad
even for a very important business trip.

460
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,470
Joon Jae, what is it that you want to say?

461
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,870
That I can't trust you.

462
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,940
That I'm canceling how I told you
to be a dutiful son to Father.

463
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,360
We want to verify his flight records.

464
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,740
His name is Heo Il Joon.
His resident number is 58-110-

465
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,010
Yeah, they're not here,
your father's travel records.

466
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,640
Hawaii or wherever, he hasn't been out
of the country for the past six months.

467
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,210
I'm certain he's in the country.

468
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,220
Hyung,

469
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,660
there's a place we need to break in.

470
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,000
Where? Where is it? Where are we stealing from?

471
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,670
Wait a sec.

472
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,240
Where do you want to steal from?

473
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,110
- My father's house.  - What?

474
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,810
Hey, are you joking? How does it make
sense to steal from your father's house?

475
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:10,750
Yeah, well, it would be good if we could
get in there and gather some evidence.

476
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,550
But still, that Kang Seo
Hee woman is frightening.

477
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,760
What if we get caught and croak, too? Hello?

478
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,210
I'll help, too.

479
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,310
- Help with what?  - Stealing from
Heo Joon Jae's father's house.

480
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,450
- I'll help, too. - You heard everything?

481
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,950
No, it's fine.

482
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,790
But then again, you know Heo Chi
Hyeon, his stepbrother,

483
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,160
and Joon Jae's mother are linked to Kang Seo Hee.

484
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,360
But still, you can't. If Joon Jae finds out, it'll
be hell! How about if we do it without him knowing?

485
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,930
What is it? What do you want help with?

486
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,870
What do you want me to do with that woman Kang?

487
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,870
Can you call her outside for about two hours?

488
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,940
About two hours?

489
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,750
That woman is so particular that she
doesn't really like to go to gatherings.

490
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,520
It is kind of hard to call her out,

491
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,390
but I think there's way where
she can't help but come out.

492
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,130
What? Ahn Jin Joo gathered up everyone except me?

493
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:38,370
Yes. I heard that she's going to
reveal some crucial information!

494
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,670
Something about how lies can't
win against truth or whatever.

495
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,410
This woman, is she crazy? Where?
Tell me where and when!

496
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,050
She made me promise not to tell you.

497
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,020
- You can't tell her that you
heard from me, Madam— - I got it!

498
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,320
Hurry up and tell me where!

499
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,470
Are you sleeping, Father?

500
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,170
Yeah. I guess the medicine is too strong.
I'm a little fuzzy.

501
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,280
- Did you drink?  - Yes.

502
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:24,120
Father, couldn't your son be

503
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,020
only me?

504
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,120
If so, then I'd protect you well until the end.

505
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,960
Does there have to be Joon Jae, too?

506
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,730
Really?

507
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,670
It's because I'm upset too. I told Joon Jae

508
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:52,910
many times that you're unwell,
but he says he won't come.

509
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,310
To me,

510
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:00,990
he said since he's your father,
take care of him yourself.

511
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:05,320
Father. Do you know what he's up to these days?

512
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,720
He's going around defrauding people.

513
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,730
I was worried so when I looked into it.
That's what he has been doing.

514
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,930
But still,

515
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,640
does it have to be Joon Jae?

516
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,940
You're drunk.

517
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,840
Go to bed.

518
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,010
Yes, Father.

519
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,300
100% Customer Satisfaction!

520
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,540
One Shot, One Kill, Goodbye, Bug

521
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,280
Yeah.

522
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,220
- Where are you going like that?  - What about you?

523
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,920
Me?

524
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,820
I have work to do.

525
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,560
Oh, we have work to do, so we'll be going,
Cheong. Yeah, see you later. Talk to you later.

526
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:52,760
Aren't you cold in winter like that?
It's short! Change before you go out.

527
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,530
Why is this short?

528
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,840
I don't think it's that short.

529
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,900
Still, it's too...

530
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,210
pretty! Change!

531
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,710
You're doing all kinds of things. All kinds.

532
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,010
Okay? Change.

533
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,580
Is it? Is it too pretty?

534
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,090
Yeah, it's not right to be too pretty today.

535
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:36,410
Hey, we were on a stakeout here for a week,

536
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,910
but we've never seen your father once. Maybe
not abroad but he could have gone out of town.

537
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,180
- Heo Chi Hyeon is going to be late tonight,
too, right? - Yeah, that I confirmed.

538
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,290
Let's get it done quickly.

539
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:51,760
Is this okay to do, really?
I don't know anything, okay?

540
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,330
Don't do anything illegal and be careful!

541
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,300
Are you sending off your son?

542
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,770
One Shot, One Kill, Goodbye Bug, we'll do once over.

543
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,940
Why are you here so early this month?

544
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,210
Ah, well...

545
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,120
The house ant traps are only good for 15 days,

546
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,110
so we'll set up the new ones
quickly after taking away the old.

547
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:14,180
Don't mind us.

548
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,620
How many traps are in the kitchen?

549
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,560
I was glad you called me. Thank you.

550
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,330
Heo Chi Hyeon, to be honest,
there's something I'm curious about.

551
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,540
What is it?

552
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,370
Do you know someone named Ma Dae Young?

553
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:45,840
Ma Dae Young and your mother and
you, how are you related?

554
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,200
Why are you asking something like that?

555
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,870
Ma Dae Young keeps lingering around us.
I don't know why that is.

556
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:16,580
If that has something to do with your family,
I thought you might be able to stop it.

557
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,940
I'm sorry, but I can't.

558
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,680
I have nothing to do with that person.

559
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,320
Ahjummeoni, the ant traps that are

560
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,590
in the corners...

561
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,430
Ahjummeoni,

562
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:10,900
over here, please. Let me explain.

563
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,500
The ant traps,

564
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:33,250
we have to install about 10
and 10 for the cockroaches.

565
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,120
Then we'll start fumigating.

566
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,710
Ah, what is this? There's a sign of earwigs!

567
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:57,940
You see that black thing? Do you see it?

568
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,450
It's not dust but an earwig's excrement.

569
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:07,890
Ah, no matter how much effort you make, you
can't prevent them from coming into a house.

570
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,690
Is it you, Honey?

571
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,250
Are you Chi Hyeon?

572
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,720
Who are you?

573
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,920
I said who are you?

574
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,610
Are you looking for this?

575
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,350
Father.

576
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,020
Are you Joon Jae?

577
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:51,720
What were you doing in here?

578
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,830
Are you really Joon Jae?

579
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:59,460
What in the world are you seeing in here?!

580
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:04,440
What's with you?

581
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,370
You couldn't even recognize your own son.

582
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,740
To suffer into this state,
you separated from my mom

583
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,550
and you treated me so badly?

584
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:27,630
Oh, Ahjumma, Ahjumma! Would you look over here?

585
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,760
Underneath this carpet, usually...

586
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,700
Let me just go to the room for a second.

587
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,940
Oh, Ahjumma! You need to hear more.

588
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,850
Let's leave for now.

589
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:47,580
To where?

590
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,580
Anywhere but this house.

591
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,020
Yeah, but why?

592
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,390
If you stay here any longer,
we won't know what will happen to you.

593
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:59,060
This is my house.
What would happen to me in my own house?

594
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:08,400
What happened to Manager Nam, and to
you, is all Stepmother's doing!

595
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:14,770
I don't know how you entered into this house, but...

596
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:19,540
After coming back home after ten years, all
you can do is choose to slander your mother?

597
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,750
Who's my mother?

598
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:27,890
You probably wanted to tell
me that my choice was wrong.

599
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,820
Yes, you chose wrong.

600
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,090
From the beginning to the end. Everything!

601
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,090
Who are you to judge that?

602
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:41,000
It's my choice! And it's my life! It's not wrong.

603
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,170
I was happy.

604
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,940
Just because my eyesight is getting a bit dull,

605
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:53,880
you want to tell me my choice and my life is a fail?

606
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,320
This eye will get completely
better after surgery.

607
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,990
It's because my body's condition isn't good that
I can't do surgery. If I just did surgery...!

608
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,530
It seems that I, who am standing in front
of you, am the only one you can't see.

609
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,530
You can't see anything.

610
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:15,330
How your life is going downhill...

611
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:19,600
You have no intention of seeing that.

612
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,040
Do you want to criticize
your stepmother that much?

613
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:31,320
You rascal. She's a kind woman who still cleans
your room and waits for you to come home.

614
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:36,460
For living together for 17
years, I know her the best.

615
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,960
What would you know?!

616
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,860
Kang Seo Hee's real name is Kang Ji Hyun.
She was married twice.

617
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,670
Both her husbands, one from a car accident
due to the traumatic damage to cornea,

618
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,600
and the other from heart
failure, have passed away.

619
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,610
You being like this...

620
00:54:53,610 --> 00:55:00,610
It would be really great if it was a coincidence,
but all these situations are saying it's not.

621
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,390
Where did you get such lies...?

622
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,590
If you don't want to believe
it, then don't believe it.

623
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:14,090
But... I can't leave you alone like this.

624
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:18,560
Even if by force, I have to take you with me.

625
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,370
Let's go.

626
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:22,870
Let's go.

627
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:27,540
Let me go! He said you've been defrauding people!

628
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:33,380
That's why you're doing this horrible
thing to me now, you bastard!

629
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,000
(I called) because it's weird with
the loud noises from upstairs.

630
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,070
They said they work for an
exterminator company but

631
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:57,670
I do hear "Father" and things like that.

632
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,710
Okay. Ahjumeoni. I'll head home right now.

633
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:05,380
Don't let Father leave, and if something
happens, immediately report it to the police.

634
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,090
Is this why you asked to meet with me today?

635
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:17,660
It looks like Joon Jae is at home.

636
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:22,230
I'm sorry. It seems I won't
be driving you home. Goodbye.

637
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:26,920
Your memory will completely disappear,
and I'm sure you'll be arrested.

638
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,330
Even though you can't remember anything,

639
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:38,660
I hope that you will get a taste
of hell for a very long time.

640
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,340
She's a real mermaid.

641
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,840
You have to kill her. Catch her!

642
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,810
Catch her!

643
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,420
Se Hwa!

644
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,610
The two live well.

645
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,580
They weren't sick nor were they hurt.

646
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:08,590
They bore many pretty babies
and while raising them well,

647
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:11,920
live a long, long time, happily

648
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,390
growing old together.

649
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,800
Lies again.

650
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,040
♬My nameless love ♬

651
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:28,610
It was all lies again.

652
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:41,120
♬ Before I knew you was the sky  ♬

653
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,190
♬ always as brilliant?♬

654
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:54,900
♬ If out of ten thousand chances,
our love came into being ♬

655
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,700
Are you hurting somewhere? Why are you so cold?

656
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,440
Please leave me.

657
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,740
I like you a lot. Not as a friend but as a man.

658
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,910
What kind of person was Ma Dae Young?

659
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,150
Hey, you bastard! Why are you saying this now?

660
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:09,650
Unni! Come inside!

661
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,920
I told you not to let just anyone come in!

662
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,220
Why did you lie?

663
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:16,590
So? Do you regret us being together?

664
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:21,090
♬ I don't remember everything ♬
