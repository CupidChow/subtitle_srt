1
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,950
Please come out, quickly! Quick!

2
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,100
So, you want to go at it?

3
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,810
Sure, I will show you

4
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,750
what can be accomplished
when a bitch works hard...

5
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,630
You did not get hurt anywhere?

6
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,630
Please stay here for a moment.

7
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,770
By the way, do you know who I am?

8
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,140
No way, you followed me without knowing
who I am... How could you trust so simply?

9
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,680
I am a friend of Dam Ryeong.

10
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,820
A friend... what is that?

11
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,050
A friend is...

12
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:59,460
a person who believes to the end whatever
unbelievable nonsense is uttered by him.

13
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,370
If he has a lover, the friend should
take care of her together as well.

14
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,540
Is that why you've saved me?

15
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,940
Don't go out because it's
dangerous, so please stay here.

16
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,110
I will quickly go bring Dam Ryeong here.

17
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,820
She's certainly bewitching. He's bewitched.

18
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,660
What am I going through because
of my buddy, Dam Young...

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,940
Get him!

20
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,740
Yes sir!

21
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,100
Se Hwa!

22
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,770
Se Hwa!

23
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,740

24

35
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,540
Episode 6

36
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,800
Was a guardian contacted?

37
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,680
We were unable to identify her

38
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,410
since there is neither an ID
nor a cell phone with her at this moment.

39
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,320
Let's register her as a "Jane Doe" and ask
the police to do a background check on her.

40
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,550
It'll be a headache if she continues
to be unconscious. Please let me know.

41
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,050
Yes.

42
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
Don't just click whenever,

43
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,290
but click when you change your
mind and are ready to tell me everything.

44
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,630
Click only at that time!

45
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,000
Unknown Person

46
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,010
Sim Cheong

47
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,250
Silly, what happened to her!

48
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,650
Yes, it appears to me that there was
an accident near the Namsan Tower.

49
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,120
I am wondering which hospital
the patient might have gone to?

50
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,360
Because it snowed there were many accidents,

51
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,400
and it will take some time
to find the information.

52
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,230
Presumably transferred to the clinics near...

53
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,930
I see.

54
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,470
Stay firm, Joon Jae! I will save you!

55
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,670
What happened here?

56
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,240
Does it hurt?

57
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,110
Heo Joon Jae! I earn money here.

58
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,120
I will make lots of money and give it all to you!

59
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,460
Let's meet next time when the first snow comes.

60
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,290
There! Meet right there!

61
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,910
By any chance, is there an emergency
female patient, around her early thirties?

62
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,640
Name?

63
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,890
Is this it Saerip Hospital? I'm wondering
if there are any car accident patients.

64
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:33,000
No, not a 50-something but a young early thirties?

65
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,870
Long hair, fair skin, and...

66
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,100
Ah, and very beautiful!

67
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,480
Don't have such a person? I understand.

68
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Madame,

69
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,360
the CEO has to pay his condolences to the family
in mourning suddenly and needs a black tie—

70
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,260
Did you get his message?

71
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,800
Yes, just now. We planned to have
dinner together but had to cancel.

72
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,170
So, I decided to go out as well.

73
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:24,920
Uh, yes. I told her to have dinner
at home but I forgot to call her.

74
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,950
You've mentioned to my wife that I
will be visiting a house in mourning?

75
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,930
Yes. I did.

76
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,090
Then, let's go.

77
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,660
Yes.

78
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,970
Is it here?

79
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,960
Here! Here! Here!

80
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,370
Are you her guardian?

81
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,730
This woman, have you checked her temperature?

82
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,840
The basic exam was done a while ago, and she is
waiting for an exam for fractures. Please wait.

83
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,540
Examined all?

84
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,850
The child is cold like ice!
Are you sure you did an exam?

85
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,960
What is it?

86
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,160
Doctor! Doctor?

87
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,390
What?

88
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,200
This patient. I can't check the vitals
and her temperature is 29C!

89
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,330
What nonsense are you saying? What's 29 degrees!

90
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,800
CPR. Please prepare the defibrillator!

91
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,040
- Yes, Doctor.  - Intubation!

92
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,680
Patient! Patient! Can you hear me? Patient!

93
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,650
- Charge to 200 joules.- Charged to 200 joules!

94
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,880
Step back! (clear) Shoot! (Charge)

95
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,470
Heo Joon Jae.

96
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,180
Are you...

97
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,320
alright?

98
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,450
I had a dream.

99
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,230
You held my hand.

100
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,360
You saved me.

101
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
- Check her organs.
- OK.

102
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,340
Prepare the chest x-ray...

103
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,350
Hey, quickly, quickly! As quick as possible!

104
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,770
Hey, where do you think Joon Jae went
earlier? I think he went to a club.

105
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,710
After having kicked that seriously
vapid Cheong out, he's gone out to play.

106
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,800
As the saying goes,
"the student becomes the master."

107
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,640
Joon Jae, who learned bad things from me,
became worse than me.

108
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,580
What is it, you nastier jerk?

109
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,460
Hey, he's asking to make a fake
ID with insurance coverage.

110
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,790
He says he doesn't want to.

111
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,530
Hey, it's not like you're making him donate his
talent. Don't make him do something so trivial.

112
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,140
It's not like you're going
to pay him by the hour. What?

113
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,410
Cheong is in the ER now?

114
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,910
Why, why, why, why? A traffic accident?

115
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,480
Ah, right. Right now she has
neither family nor friends.

116
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,290
Of course, she needs an ID. An ID!

117
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,560
Are you really okay?

118
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,970
Heo Joon Jae, did you worry about me?

119
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,240
Yes.

120
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,210
- Really? - I said yes.

121
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,340
Why?

122
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,380
That's because...

123
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,100
If something bad were to happen to you,

124
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,920
since you're an unknown person
without a home, family, or friends,

125
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,250
it would really bother me.

126
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,960
Heo Joon Jae did worry about me.

127
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,100
Did it never occur to you
to avoid an on-coming car?

128
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,300
You held my hand earlier because
you were worried about me, right?

129
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,670
Don't you see that I'm scolding you right now?

130
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,270
When you cross the street, please look both ways.

131
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,080
What did you do so well that you'd scold her?

132
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,850
This is all because you kicked
Cheong out of the house!

133
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,150
Why do you look at a person in that manner, huh?

134
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,620
Ah, move over. Are you okay, Cheong?
How did you get hurt, Cheong?

135
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,660
We worried a lot about you on our way over here.

136
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,460
Ah, enough of that.
Did you make the thing I asked for?

137
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,600
Of course we made it, we did. But how come...

138
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,270
Ah, stop making her talk. The doctor
said it's not good for her to talk a lot.

139
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,670
You said she hurt her legs,
but she shouldn't speak?

140
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,870
The doctor said no.

141
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,470
- Does that sound right? - They said it's possible.

142
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,640
So just go and take care of the
appropriate procedures (to be discharged).

143
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,350
Rest up, Cheong.

144
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,310
Just go on.

145
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,330
I'm here to take care of the ER patient
Sim Cheong's discharge procedure.

146
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,630
Here are her ID and her insurance card.

147
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,430
Hey, that female patient in a traffic accident
whose body temperature was 29 Celsius,

148
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,800
is it true that she was
resuscitated after one shock?

149
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,910
Don't even mention it, man. I thought she expired.

150
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,640
- I nearly pronounced a perfectly fine person
dead.- I bet you were scared sh!tless.

151
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,710
By the way, even the name of that patient is
unique. What was she called again? Choon Hyang?

152
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,020
No, Sim Cheong.

153
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,520
As the test came back
negative for alcohol or drugs,

154
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,220
and because you reported it immediately, first
aid to the injured was carried out rapidly.

155
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,590
You won't face any major issues, should you
settle the matter with the other party well.

156
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,100
- I am sorry.  - Where is the injured party?

157
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,260
Ah, there...

158
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,970
Was that you who hit her with a car?
(using Informal "you")

159
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,610
You? (informal "you")

160
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,310
Heo Joon Jae! I'm your older brother!

161
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,250
An older brother, as if!

162
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,690
Let's not pretend to be this non-existent
family, and answer my question.

163
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,220
Did you hit her with a car?

164
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,360
That lady suddenly jumped into the road.
It was a chance accident.

165
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,230
It was a chance accident.  [Summer 2006]

166
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,300
A chance?

167
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,700
You're saying it was a chance accident?

168
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:10,710
It was just that... I came to borrow your
MP3. I didn't know this was on your desk

169
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,110
and hit it with my elbow by accident.
I'm really sorry.

170
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,550
Father, I'm sorry.

171
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,150
It can happen to anyone.

172
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,490
You, didn't I tell you to throw
that away a long time ago?

173
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,860
If you accidentally dropped it, the broken
pieces would be in the area of the fall.

174
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,500
The frame and bracket would not have
shattered and been scattered all over.

175
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,770
This meant you smashed it intending to break it.

176
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,210
Ah! No! Truly, believe me.

177
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,770
That's enough. Stop!

178
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,740
Watching your mom polish the frame with
much care and not asking to remove it...

179
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,780
Do you have any idea how sorry I
felt toward your mom all this time?

180
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,690
It's for the best. Throw it out. You clean it up.

181
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,470
Hey, you punks! Joon Jae!

182
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,970
Why you rotten... Hey Chi Hyeon!

183
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,240
Let me see. Are you hurt a lot?

184
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,110
God, look at this.

185
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,980
You rotten punk.

186
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,790
Let's go to the hospital.

187
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,840
There is no such thing as a coincidence to you.

188
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,940
That, I know for certain.

189
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,380
Don't be irrational. Then are you
saying that I hit her on purpose?

190
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,150
You seldom drive yourself.

191
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,680
The fact that you were
driving yourself meant

192
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,590
that your destination was
somewhere you couldn't disclose.

193
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,430
Are you writing a novel?

194
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,000
Say it! Have you tracked me down?

195
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Is that how you came to hit her?

196
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,140
Huh, what nonsense...

197
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,880
Are you the one who hired a person
to track me down a while ago?

198
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,850
If not you, your mother?

199
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:39,290
Don't just say anything! Why would my
mother have hired a person to follow you?

200
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,830
What are you?

201
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,430
Me?

202
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,470
I'm my father's real son!

203
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,480
Go on and do your filial duty.
We both know that's your true work.

204
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,280
Go and pretend to be a real son
to the fake father. Do that!

205
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,350
Stop appearing in my presence.

206
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,320
Yes, Father.

207
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,300
Yes, the investigation just ended.

208
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,530
Ah, don't worry too much.

209
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,340
I told you I'm not hurt anywhere.

210
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,680
Ah, let's go then.

211
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,080
- Is it this way? - Yes.

212
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,220
Now, Sim Cheong, let's get off.

213
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,260
They say there were a lot of car
accidents because of the snow.

214
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,000
They said they don't have any single rooms
available, so let's just stay here for now.

215
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Then am I going to live here?

216
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,740
Not living per se, just staying for a while.

217
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,540
With all the people here?

218
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,840
Right.

219
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,970
What's marriage?

220
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,080
Marriage is a man and woman who live together
under one roof because they love each other.

221
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,350
Loving each other and taking care of each other.

222
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,120
Then am I married to these people?

223
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,420
- Huh?- They say a man and
woman living under one roof

224
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,850
loving each other and taking care
of each other is marriage, isn't it?

225
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,020
It's different from freeloading!

226
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,090
I know what there's to know too.

227
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,970
Let's sleep, alright—

228
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,000
No! Wait!

229
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,540
Are we all married now?

230
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,780
I'm so happy. Today, I'll be married here.

231
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,010
And next time, I'll marry Heo Joon Jae.

232
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,420
Let's proceed with an MRI
scan of that patient's brain.

233
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,850
Yes sir.

234
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,340
She's cute.

235
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,220
- Mr. Lee Da Bong! - Here.

236
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,350
Because of your diabetes,
you have a restriction of 1,700 calories.

237
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,390
Oh, that's a calorie controlled meal? Looks good.

238
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,230
It smells nice. It'll probably taste very savory,

239
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,300
don't you think?

240
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,700
You ordered the daily special.

241
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,500
This is spicy mussel stew with noodles.

242
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,870
That's the special?

243
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,790
Oh my, the mussels.

244
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,840
They don't usually open their mouths like that,
but I see today they all have their mouths open.

245
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,150
You were right to order the
special, it looks good.

246
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,890
Excuse me!

247
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,290
I'm here.

248
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,720
Ms. Sim Cheong, you've been ordered a fasting diet.

249
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,260
Oh, I'm fasting? Please give me the fasting.

250
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,300
I think it'll be delicious. Thank you, I'll eat well.

251
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,500
It's fasting. You get no food.

252
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,370
I get no food?

253
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,430
There's a chance you might
have to go into surgery,

254
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,140
so I've been told you have to
wait with an empty belly.

255
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,680
So you're fasting.

256
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,710
What? Why're you calling me?

257
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,740
Heo Joon Jae, what do I do...

258
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,650
Something big happened...

259
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,980
What?!

260
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,950
I got an order to fast.

261
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,280
Other people get normal meals,

262
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,720
calorie-controlled meals, and special meals,
but I was the only one that got fasting.

263
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,290
Joon Jae, what do I do?

264
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,360
What do you mean what? It's probably
because you might have to get surgery.

265
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,730
Heo Joon Jae. I'm on standby, on an empty stomach.

266
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,840
I got it, so just sleep.

267
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,140
When I close my eyes,
it goes back and forth in my sight.

268
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,050
- What does?- Jjamppong (spicy soup with noodles).

269
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,720
- You're a real handful.
- Because of the spicy soup with noodles

270
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,050
I can't sleep...

271
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,860
Heo Joon Jae...

272
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,330
Heo Joon Jae left.

273
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,260
No, I'm saying the patient's
mental state is back to normal

274
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,530
and it's not like she's got any
excessive bleeding.

275
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,700
Just looking at the potential
of an emergency operation

276
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,170
and putting her on standby on an empty stomach
just doesn't seem right to me, is all I'm saying.

277
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,210
It's just a precaution. But what the heck.

278
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,410
Are you a doctor?

279
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,950
Is that what's important right now?

280
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,180
And on top of that, the basic process
of ordering a fast for a patient

281
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,490
involves informing the patient
first, doesn't it?! No, I'm saying

282
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,620
you suddenly cut off a kid's happiness
when all it comes from is food!

283
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm telling you, her mental
state's going to plunge like this!

284
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,360
If she goes insane, are you going
to take responsibility for her!?

285
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,240
Ms. Sim Cheong,
you have a special meal for this morning.

286
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,740
Spicy soup with noodles.

287
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,300
What are you doing?

288
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,900
Are you happy about this right now?!

289
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,710
Dude. Stop. Stop it.

290
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,110
Why are you happy about a person, who had nothing
to do with you, eating some spicy noodle soup?!

291
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,590
- What is it now? - Heo Joon Jae!

292
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,820
I just got the special meal.

293
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,630
So what? I'm busy. Hang up.

294
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,070
Our Joon Jae has become more
charming than ever before.

295
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,880
Punk.

296
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,480
How could you just move away and
cut off all contact like that?

297
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,950
Sorry, Ajusshi.

298
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,560
What is this?

299
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,190
It's citrus tea.

300
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,360
You liked the one my wife made.

301
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,670
Mix it in water, so you don't catch a cold.

302
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,670
And make sure to dress warmly this winter.

303
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,880
Mommy!

304
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,350
Mom!
Winter 1988

305
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,220
Drink this. If you keep
crying, it'll hurt your throat.

306
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,750
Ajusshi!

307
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,390
Please bring my mom!

308
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:07,330
This ajusshi is really sorry for
not being able to bring your mom.

309
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,700
But instead,
this ajusshi will protect you, always—

310
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,610
Who are you to do that?!

311
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,380
Ajusshi...is our Joon Jae's friend.

312
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,550
I don't need any of that!

313
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,780
Bring my mom!

314
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,150
Bring my mom...

315
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,130
Summer 2006

316
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,230
Go that way.

317
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,500
Here.

318
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,080
I'm going to leave this house.

319
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,720
Then what about your father?

320
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,550
Even if he is like that on the outside, on the
inside, he knows he doesn't have anyone but you.

321
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,260
Father has you.

322
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,360
I'm going to leave and find my mom.

323
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,530
I'm going to buy a really nice house
and I'm going to live in it with my mom.

324
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,730
So,

325
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,070
Ajusshi, please protect my father.

326
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:23,880
Ajusshi, you kept your promise
but I still haven't kept mine.

327
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,850
Your father is looking for you.

328
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,420
It looks like he's thinking of
cleaning up the things around him.

329
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,400
In the clean up process,
take me out of the equation.

330
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,200
Ajusshi, I'll be going now.

331
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,600
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
At least for families.

332
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,630
Even when they're sorry,
they find it hard to say the words,

333
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,070
and when they miss you,
it's even harder to say so.

334
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:00,510
Your father is just like
that, and he's aged so much.

335
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,920
I'll drink this well. Please go back safely.

336
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,270
Your father

337
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,700
- is... - It's the CEO.

338
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,540
the CEO.

339
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,640
How did you know?!

340
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,340
This isn't the first time I've watched dramas.

341
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,820
When they've lost their father
or were separated when young,

342
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,990
it's 100%, 100% the CEO!

343
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,650
It's not even the president of the company.
It's always the CEO.

344
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,160
Why?

345
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,890
What do you mean why? That's just how it is!

346
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,630
I really love Gyu Hyeon-ssi.

347
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,340
- Break up with my son this instant!
- She won't take that.

348
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,740
- I can't accept this.
- Oh my, she's bound to get hit with water.

349
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,510
What!?

350
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,180
How do you know everything?!

351
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,320
You see the water on the table?
They didn't put it there to drink it.

352
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,250
That's there to splash it in her
face when she doesn't take the money.

353
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,760
You get hit with water when you don't take an
envelope of money? I can't get hit with water.

354
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,230
You're not the only one who can't
get hit with water. No one should!

355
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,900
I'd really be in lots of trouble.

356
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,300
But why is that person throwing the water?

357
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,770
It's the whole "I can't give my son to you." She's
saying she can't accept her as a family member.

358
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,240
What's a family?

359
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,840
Are you asking because you really don't
know? What do you mean what's a family?

360
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,120
The people who are taking care
of each other, they're family.

361
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,730
So families are like red bean fish pastries.

362
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,800
They look just like each
other, like fish pastries,

363
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,200
and they're warm and sweet.

364
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,340
It's weird, isn't it? Very weird?
Weird from all angles,

365
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,510
whether we're talking about the
mental state or physical state.

366
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,150
The truth is, even with this accident,

367
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:18,380
they said she shouldn't be able to recover like that,
but she's already flying around.

368
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,790
It's strange.

369
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:24,020
Oh my, what's going on? Is she a zombie or what?

370
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,190
And I was bitten by someone like her.

371
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,530
You should get a tetanus shot, just in case.

372
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,930
But why's Joon Jae around
acting like her guardian?

373
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,270
It should've been over with
once he kicked her out.

374
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:39,500
He thinks the reason he can't remember
what happened in Spain is connected to her.

375
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,980
And he's probably just curious about
that enigmatic bundle of a woman.

376
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,250
I'm curious too. What in the world is she?

377
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,920
I've been coming up with ideas.

378
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,150
Don't you think it's something like,
"heiress who's lost her memory" or something?

379
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,290
And her physique is super strong because
she ate a lot of wild ginseng or something.

380
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:03,730
Where can you see that in her? At the
blink of an eye, you know she's poor.

381
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,380
Demanding the truth behind the medical
accident!Please tell me why my daughter died!

382
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,990
Vice President, welcome back.

383
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,750
You, are you in your right mind?

384
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,500
Didn't you hear that the son of the chairman
of the board was returning from London?

385
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,630
You're supposed to get rid of trash like that!

386
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,140
I'm sorry.

387
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,470
I told you to report this woman for
defamation and obstruction of business!

388
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,170
I'm sorry.

389
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,540
What are you doing? I said hurry up and remove her!

390
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,920
Vice president, that lady suddenly lost
her daughter, so I think she feels wronged.

391
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,580
So as a parent, I too—

392
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:05,860
Who the hell gives you your paycheck?
This hospital or that woman?

393
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,200
Do you want to lose your job? Do you want me to
stop allowing you to eat at the hospital, huh?

394
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,300
Hey, hey! What?

395
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,820
Vice President!

396
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,850
Are you okay?

397
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:38,220
Are you trying to give that ahjussi fasting,
too?! Empty stomachs are horrifying! Huh?!

398
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,740
Does this make sense? You said she's
a patient with a fractured bone.

399
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,740
When we checked in the emergency room,
it was definitely a fractured tibia.

400
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,120
Can't you see me flying?

401
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,180
Even a national representative in taekwondo
can't make someone fly like that!

402
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,150
That's what I'm saying.

403
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,790
What happened?

404
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,660
- Give and take.  - What?

405
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,300
This man gave another man a kick in the
leg so I gave him a kick in the leg.

406
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,500
What's wrong with her? Is she delusional?

407
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,270
We were thinking the same, so we've decided
to proceed with an MRI scan of her brain.

408
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,160
No, no, no, she's not crazy.

409
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,810
She's committing car accident
fraud pretending to be hurt to extort money.

410
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,580
Contact the law firm and tell Attorney Oh to
get here. And start all over from the x-ray!

411
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,220
I'll report to the police and let
you eat bean (prison) food properly!

412
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,220
What did she say?

413
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,160
She asked if bean food was good.

414
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,710
Trying to find the truth
behind a medical accident

415
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,680
You're in a tight spot because of me, right?

416
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,420
I'm sorry.

417
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,980
Why are you so sad?

418
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,820
Our Ae Yeon

419
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:24,230
was so kind. She didn't even go on a
school trip so she could help her mom.

420
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,830
They said it would be a simple surgery.

421
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,240
If I had known that she would never wake up again,

422
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,050
I should've done everything for her.
I should've sent her on that trip by force,

423
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,920
I should've bought her a lot of pretty clothes.

424
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,330
I should have told her to play around
instead of working part-time jobs.

425
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,930
Because I keep thinking about the things
I haven't been able to do for her,

426
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:06,300
I can't sleep and I can't eat. Ae Yeon...

427
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,950
Would you like to hear my secret?

428
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,560
I can erase human memories.

429
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,800
If you would like me to,
I can erase all of your sad memories.

430
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,900
If you don't remember your daughter,
then you won't be sad and hurting.

431
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,840
I will do it for you.

432
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,380
I'm leaving for school!

433
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,320
- Did you pack your lunch?- I packed it!
Hurry up, and go back in.

434
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,620
Mom, I don't need to go on that
school field trip. I'm fine, really.

435
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,960
My mom smells good.

436
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,200
Ah, really. Did you finish your homework?

437
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Of course I did. Who am I?

438
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,630
Mom, aren't I funny?

439
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:12,000
- You're not funny. - Mom, when I'm done
with my surgery, let's go to Jeju Island.

440
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,410
Okay. I'll be outside, so don't worry.

441
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,880
I'll see you later.

442
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,110
No.

443
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,050
I will keep her in my heart,

444
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,220
no matter how much it hurts, until I die.

445
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:36,560
Why? Why would you keep her
in your heart when it hurts?

446
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,800
Because even if it hurts,

447
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,640
I can love her.

448
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,280
More than not being able to love
because I can't remember my daughter,

449
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,720
I would rather remember

450
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,620
and love her, even if it hurts.

451
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:12,230
- Ow!- Wow, he went really far!
Didn't you say she has a fracture?

452
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,000
- I did. - What is this then,
"The Miracle of Sim Cheong"?

453
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,600
I don't know. Maybe the scans
got switched or something.

454
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,080
Anyway, what are you going to do?

455
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,140
The vice president that was hit is threatening
to sue Sim Cheong for falsifying her injury.

456
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,750
What am I supposed to do?

457
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,580
- Aren't you going to help her?

458
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,780
- Why help her? Anyone looking
would agree it's car accident fraud.

459
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,990
Look at it. She's supposed to have a fracture,
but she's flying! Something is weird!

460
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,690
Hey, but look here. When I was watching before,

461
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,860
look at this guy. He was kicked!

462
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,400
But well, whatever. If you don't want to, then
there's no reason for me to either. Oh, well.

463
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,940
Hyung. You know what I hate
the most in the world, right?

464
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,340
I know. Not leaving without saying farewell.

465
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,110
Not that! There's something else: no manners.

466
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,910
- Oh, you were like that?- Yeah, I was!
I always put a lot of weight on respect.

467
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:08,920
- Oh, you did? - Yeah, I did! I can overlook what Sim
Cheong did, but I just can't look past this one.

468
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,960
So what?

469
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:17,030
Let's rip him off. This human
being with absolutely no manners.

470
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:20,070
This hospital's chairman of the board
is on vacation in Hawaii right now.

471
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,720
His son is flying back for
the first time in ten years

472
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,730
[Dad, I'm at the hospital.
But no one's at the airport.]

473
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,670
to take over the management rights.

474
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,080
In the vice president's position, God's
coming. The presence of absolute authority.

475
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,780
- Yes, Chairman. - Hey, Vice President,
didn't all the staff go to the airport?

476
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Yes, Sir. They are all out there standing by.

477
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:44,460
My son is said to have arrived at the
hospital already! What's going on?!

478
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,570
Vice President Yi Hyeon Dong, I presume?

479
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,640
Ah, yes, yes, yes. William Choi.

480
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,870
Forget it!

481
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,440
I'm so sorry about the airport.

482
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,210
I'm not sure where and how it was mixed
up, but I'm sorry nevertheless.

483
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:08,510
Daddy said I should "phone call" him,
but my "cell phone battery" is out.

484
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,890
Chairman.

485
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,760
Ah, Dad? I arrived.

486
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,630
Forget it. I waited at the airport for two hours,
then rode a taxi here. Geez, I'm so annoyed.

487
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,300
What? Don't do that. Don't cut (fire) him.

488
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,570
Why do you want to cut a person?! Really, I'm fine.

489
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,080
Vice President's Office

490
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,950
Ah, William Choi?

491
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,720
Ah, yes. I'll be escorting you to the
hospital comfortably.Won't you come this way?

492
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,260
In that time,
I'll take the real William for a drive.

493
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,960
Um, where are you going now?

494
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,530
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get around
to updating my navigation software,

495
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,900
so I took a wrong turn,
and it seems we're on a highway.

496
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,160
While we buy some time,

497
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,310
Tae Ho will secure the files on the
Vice President's cell phone and laptop.

498
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:12,880
You'd be able to find some dirt just by
sniffing some voice mail and e-mail content.

499
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,620
Search results: - Yae Eun Kim patient
record- Yae Eun Kim patient record revision

500
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,640
To erase the info on surgery
mistakes regarding patient's death...

501
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,440
Make the guardian, who signed the
consent form, responsible...

502
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,420
Make the cause of death the patient's fault...

503
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,390
Right here. See!

504
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,790
We will install the latest and greatest—

505
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,530
Geesh, the smell...

506
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,110
Ah! There's some sort of disgusting smell.

507
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,340
Ah, it must be the smell of disinfectant,

508
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,750
as we put such emphasis on disinfection that...

509
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,780
Gawd. The smell's from you, Vice President.

510
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,020
- Disgusting shit...- Me?

511
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,790
Um... It must be because I have chronic gastritis.

512
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,860
But you know, the smell doesn't
disappear even when you shut your mouth.

513
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,670
Our Vice President must be fishy (pun) in some way.

514
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,370
- I'm not sure what you mean by... - Oh my god!

515
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,670
Please stop talking.

516
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,950
Who are you guys?

517
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,220
You aren't the Chairman's son, are you?

518
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,620
The fishy smell must have originated from here.

519
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,330
Medical negligence,
embezzlement, accostment bribes.

520
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,370
Wow, this one would cause a serious
trouble if your wife found out.

521
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,700
Personally, I detest a person who doesn't
protect his family. (people who have affairs)

522
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,340
I guess the pharmaceutical
companies give their rebates

523
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,810
by holding golf tournaments these days.

524
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,480
One round is 1,000,000 Won (1000 USD), then
one day would be 100,000,000 ($100,000)?

525
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,450
Well, of course, they will lose on purpose.

526
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,480
Why are you doing this to me?

527
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,220
What would you like to do? Shall I
disclose all that is here to the reporters?

528
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,800
Hurry, please. He has a hand tremor.

529
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,900
How much do you want?

530
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,900
Ah, what? You'd like to
resolve everything with money?

531
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,840
That sure is a good attitude, but

532
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,740
I won't be receiving any money on this,
as it is the end of the year (holidays).

533
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,450
Instead, won't you do a good deed?

534
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,250
Ah, yes, of course. Whatever it is.

535
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,290
Firstly, you know that eccentric
woman with the flying kick?

536
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,220
- Yes. - Go easy on her, please.

537
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,430
Ah, for that small deed. I'll be lenient.

538
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,400
It didn't hurt too much.

539
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,330
Okay.

540
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,170
And also, I saw as I was coming up...

541
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,370
Hello, Sir.

542
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:59,280
I was... sorry, last time. (Using formal speech)

543
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,040
I request the truth in medical malpractice.

544
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,190
Please tell me why my daughter died.

545
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:21,830
This is... the original record of the surgery.

546
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,740
Treatment History/Record

547
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,320
It is indeed our medical error (malpractice).

548
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,390
There was a mistake in mid-surgery,

549
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:47,060
and because we were unable to properly
monitor the patient's status, post surgery,

550
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:51,500
we caused your daughter to
die as you rightly suspected.

551
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:00,810
We are at fault.

552
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,130
Any future legal procedure
and the compensation

553
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,380
would be with our legal department.

554
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,780
I'm truly sorry.

555
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,220
Oops. A mistake.

556
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,160
You're such a...

557
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,630
What's good for a hand tremor, by the way?

558
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,570
I really like the hospital.

559
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,970
The food is delicious, and it's not cold.

560
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:35,610
Come now. How can the hospital
food be delicious? It's so bland.

561
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,910
Why doesn't this open?

562
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:48,190
Goodness, you're so strong! Thanks.

563
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,030
Oh, I see you're having a meal.

564
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,430
Are you taking your meal well
and not feeling any discomfort?

565
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,830
Yes.

566
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:10,880
Ms. Sim Cheong, as you're
fine, you may be discharged.

567
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,150
- What is being discharged? - I'm saying that you
may return to your original place (go home).

568
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,380
What is "return to my original place"?

569
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,380
Going home, you know.

570
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,060
Is it because I ate too much?

571
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,090
I see that's how it is.
Would I be able to stay if I don't eat?

572
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,490
Ah, no. That's not what I mean.

573
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,030
Oh, I don't have a home.

574
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,300
I can't go home...

575
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,270
Let's go home.

576
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,110
Let's go, home, I said.

577
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,450
Okay.

578
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,580
Hey, hey.

579
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,050
Doctor, is it okay for her to run like this?

580
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:01,060
Yes, we did an overall checkup and
she's fine. She can run a marathon.

581
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,930
Is this possible?

582
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,930
Possibly there was a mistake in the ER,
and the x-rays might have been switched.

583
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,970
There is almost never such an incident.
I'm really sorry.

584
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,510
Are you alright?

585
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,680
Let's go.

586
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,530
Heo Joon Jae, when does the first snow fall?

587
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:42,800
The first snow comes once a year.

588
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,970
This year's first snow has come and gone.
It'll come next year.

589
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:47,570
Is that right?

590
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,410
Then I guess I won't be able to see the first snow.

591
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:53,910
Why not?

592
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:58,520
What now? Are you going somewhere next year?

593
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,990
Where are you going?

594
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:14,230
Heo Joon Jae, do people want to remember
even if it hurts and makes them sad?

595
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,230
What do you mean?

596
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:20,070
What kind of love would it
be to want to remember it

597
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,740
despite it being so painful that it
makes you unable to eat or sleep?

598
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,640
I love you.

599
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,650
What am I thinking about right now?

600
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,460
- Hmm? - Huh?

601
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,790
It's nothing.

602
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:49,170
Would you like to see the first snow?

603
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:54,010
Though the first snow in Seoul is over, there
are placesthat still haven't had snow.

604
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,670
There are?

605
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,640
What then? Would you like to try going?

606
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,110
Yes, I want to try.

607
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,510
Okay.

608
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,820
I can obtain a medical record here, correct?

609
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,960
Yes. Did you bring the consent
form and a power of attorney?

610
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,560
Ah, yes. Here they are.

611
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,900
- The x-ray will be included as well, right? - Yes.

612
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,410
CEO, I've met with Joon Jae.

613
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,040
You met him?

614
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,710
Yes, sir.

615
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:36,620
I've passed onto him that
you've been wanting to meet him,

616
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,750
but it seems he still needs some time.

617
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,620
I'll meet him again and try to persuade him.

618
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,150
Chief Nam.

619
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,220
Yes, sir?

620
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,880
I'm always grateful for you.

621
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,520
It's nothing, sir.

622
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,060
Please let me see him, no matter what it takes.
I have a lot of things I want to tell him.

623
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,690
Yes sir, I understand.

624
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,660
Have you received a call from the CEO?

625
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,560
Yes, just now.

626
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,350
Who?

627
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,900
This much snow fell since the first snow?!

628
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:44,980
That's right. Me, I went through so much trouble
trying to find where it snows most, just for you.

629
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:48,250
Thank you, Heo Joon Jae.

630
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,920
Let's go in.

631
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,250
♬  When I made you wait ♬

632
00:52:53,250 --> 00:53:01,960
♬  Whenever you smile, I'm always sorry ♬

633
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,930
♬ Precious things ♬

634
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:13,110
♬ Always make me scared ♬

635
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:17,580
♬ I'm always so nervous, so worried about you ♬

636
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:23,380
♬ It's the first time I've ever felt this way ♬

637
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:30,020
Wow, isn't she a goddess?♬ Wherever it
is, whenever the time is when I meet you ♬

638
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:35,490
♬ And tell you I love you,
as if I say it all the time ♬

639
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:41,070
Let's put these on. You have to put stuff like
this on when you're here.♬ Whenever I see you ♬

640
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:46,340
♬ Somewhere inside me keeps hurting ♬

641
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:53,150
♬ Wherever it is, whenever the time ♬

642
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,240
But, I feel like I've seen this scene somewhere...

643
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,280
I'm afraid that we'll have to
go far away from each other ♬

644
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,650
♬ And forget ♬

645
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:01,720
Is it déjà vu?

646
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:08,530
♬ Even when I'm holding your hand ♬

647
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,680
Now, watch close.

648
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,900
When you're going down, if you make an
11 with your feet, then you'll slide right down.

649
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,040
Like this, see?

650
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,380
And to stop—

651
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,910
How do I stop?!

652
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,950
Hey! Make an A! An A!

653
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:35,090
What's an A?! I don't know what an A is!

654
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:37,320
That idiot!

655
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:44,260
Heo Joon Jae!

656
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:03,350
Heo Joon Jae! Move, move!

657
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,190
Ack!

658
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,280
You... Do you know or do you not
know, that I just saved your life.

659
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,240
I know.

660
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,820
You... Just do one thing I ask you to do.

661
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,520
What is it?

662
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,200
The thing is,

663
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,140
I'm trying to confirm something.

664
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,740
Mhm.

665
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,870
You...

666
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,180
Can you try saying this?

667
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,180
What is it?

668
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:22,330
I love you.

669
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:26,100
♬ This is love story ♬

670
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,800
♬  I cannot hide ♬

671
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,640
♬ My two eyes which only see you ♬

672
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,510
♬ I cannot close them ♬

673
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:41,180
♬ This is amazing ♬

674
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:45,780
♬ Even if everything in the world ♬

675
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,490
♬ were given to me ♬

676
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:55,590
♬ I cannot exchange it for you, my love. ♬

677
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,870
♬ Someday just once ♬

678
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,970
♬ will come to me ♬

679
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:10,280
♬ That person, that love  ♬

680
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,410
♬ I will find for sure ♬

681
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,880
EpilogueSo family is like
red-bean fish pastry.

682
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,920
They all look alike, and they're warm,

683
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,960
and they're sweet.

684
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,330
Well, it's not always nice.
They're both the illness and the cure.

685
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:32,660
Even with me, I was going through all sorts of
work, trying to help my son pay off his debt.

686
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,470
That's when the disc in my back ruptured.

687
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,300
♬ I'm afraid this might be a dream,  ♬

688
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,440
♬ I can't open my eyes ♬

689
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,040
♬ This is my love story ♬

690
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,480
♬ I love you, only you ♬

691
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,660
Are you feeling better?
I was so shocked back then too.

692
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:03,730
It was the first time I'd ever
caused an accident and the victim...

693
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,060
The victim is someone who happens
to know my little brother.

694
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:08,270
Little brother?

695
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,300
Yes, I'm Joon Jae's family.

696
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,510
Heo Joon Jae's family?

697
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,570
Yes! Family.

698
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:41,470
Oh and this, this is mine.

699
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:46,540
Anyhow, I'm so sorry for everything.

700
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,470
And this.

701
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,980
You've got fast hands.

702
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,640
The medical bills will probably
be taken care of by insurance,

703
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,590
but you can just consider that as
a form of compensation.

704
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,330
W-Why are you looking at me like that?
Is there something on my face?

705
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:19,670
I don't like getting hit with water. Even
though I've taken the envelope of money,

706
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:22,370
- I won't break up with Heo Joon Jae.- Excuse me?

707
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:27,480
Heo Joon Jae's family! I love Heo Joon Jae.

708
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,410
Just know that.

709
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,250
Y-Yes, of course.

710
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,190
W-Wait.
