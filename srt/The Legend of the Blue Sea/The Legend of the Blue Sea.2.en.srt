1
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,450
Episode 2
Wow, it's going really fast!

2
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,650
Wow!

3
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,320
Wow, it's so pretty!

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,590
It's so pretty! This one is totally pretty too. Wow.

5
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,760
Yay!

6
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,930
Woah, hey, hey. It's totally cool.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,700
Oh, no! What's wrong with that one?

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,640
I knew that would happen.

9
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,560
Who is it?

10
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,970
Don't be afraid and come on out.

11
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,050
It was a fated bond that
should not have been made,

12
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,680
but since it has already been made

13
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,590
that fated bond will definitely continue.

14
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,190
They will meet again.

15
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,030
So you're saying

16
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,970
their two fates will continue to be connected,
so if I just keep following the town head,

17
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,670
I may be able to catch her again.

18
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,210
You told me not to be afraid,

19
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,480
but actually are you not the one who is afraid?

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,680
Can you speak?

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,260
There's no reason that a mermaid
can't do what a human can.

22
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,990
Then why did you not say a word that day?

23
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,930
I did

24
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,670
but it wasn't heard.

25
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,540
Today is a happy occasion celebrating
the newly appointed town head.

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,940
I thought to prepare for all of you

27
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,180
a rare spectacle.

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,720
Please save me.

29
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,160
Mermaids can hear each others'
minds so there's no reason to speak.

30
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,000
Then can humans not hear the minds of mermaids?

31
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,170
A long time ago, a boy loved a mermaid

32
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,940
and heard a mermaid's voice.

33
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,780
And what happened to
the boy who loved the mermaid?

34
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,200
Can we meet again?

35
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,430
If wish lanterns float above the sea,

36
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,700
I will take it as a signal that we're to meet again.

37
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,460
Are you watching him closely?

38
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,160
There's nothing special, right?

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,800
- No. Nothing yet, but...  - But?

40
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,630
The town head is asking something
strange of his soldiers.

41
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,840
What?

42
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:32,480
♬ Far above the sea which has
neither a yesterday nor a today ♬

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:41,890
♬ The blue night falls soundlessly. ♬

44
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:51,600
♬ My heart which was wandering
and crossing over the waves ♬

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:00,480
♬ waits for you to come back to the sea ♬

46
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:09,650
♬ The path which was
described in a starlit story ♬

47
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:19,000
♬ Becomes a time which spreads like a dream ♬

48
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,740
♬ In my heart which can't be reached ♬

49
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,480
♬ Wave upon blue wave which surge,  ♬

50
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:40,490
♬ Your tears that I watched for and ♬

51
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,790
♬ Your shallow breath which is fading away ♬

52
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,990
♬ Are blurring like a stain ♬

53
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:59,710
♬ That sad story hidden in the sea ♬

54
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,040
The Legend of the Blue Sea

55
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,440
Do you know what I hate the most?

56
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,610
Leaving without saying goodbye.

57
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,210
That's why I came, to say goodbye before leaving.

58
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,350
There's no other reason.

59
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,700
Anyway, I've done what I've come to do, so I'm leaving.

60
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,630
Drink it.

61
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,870
Just a minute.

62
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,420
That's right. Like that.

63
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,900
Stop blowing now and drink it.

64
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,840
Do you really have nowhere to go?

65
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,340
Whether a house, or dorm

66
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,580
or a contact person, or the cell
phone number of someone you know?

67
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,980
A guardian or a friend or something like that...

68
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,080
Who am I talking to right now?

69
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,890
I should have just left.

70
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,820
I think that I've been caught right well and good.

71
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,700
I'll go and wash up so go change
into this for now, at least.

72
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,180
Hotel

73
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,950
What the...?

74
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,230
Seriously, Hey! Turn on the light!

75
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,120
Give it.

76
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,320
Give it here!

77
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,640
Are you, by any chance, being coy?

78
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,520
Don't! Don't do that! Don't be coy!

79
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,150
My ideal type is an intellectual woman.

80
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,650
The complete opposite of you!

81
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,530
Don't look at me lubriciously like that.

82
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,470
Just in case you misunderstand,
I am telling you clearly.

83
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,120
The reason I brought you here is
because the day is almost over,

84
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,800
it's raining, and your screw is a bit loose,

85
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,840
so, "I'll let her stay just
for one night." That was all!

86
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,810
So, "Oh, my! Is this man interested in me?"

87
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,220
"Should I use the opportunity
to hook up with him somehow?"

88
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,220
Let go of this kind of
futile expectation or hope.

89
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,990
Wake up from your dream, I tell you! Hmm?

90
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,910
She is... horny!

91
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,450
...cannot be connected. After the beep-

92
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,150
Who?

93
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,920
The guy that you went to KAIST with?

94
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,690
Is that guy ignoring your calls again?

95
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm going to be working overnight in the
lab since some important pieces came in.

96
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,900
Again?

97
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,200
How nice would it have been

98
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,400
if you had just gone to med school and
become a doctor like your mom had suggested?

99
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,540
That c-c-conser- whatever that you're saying you—

100
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,300
Conservation science, Unni.

101
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,470
If you say that medical science is extending
the life of humanity as it's goal,

102
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,080
then conservation science is important work

103
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,050
that extends the
life of humanity's cultural heritage.

104
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,210
Sure.

105
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,950
Hurry and go extend the lives of those

106
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,120
ceramic pots, ink stones, and those kids.

107
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,200
But did Ji Hyeon's aunt graduate from KAIST?

108
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,900
That's why she acts so high and
mighty like that all the time.

109
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,930
Why?

110
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,000
My son went there too.

111
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The one you brag about all the time,
the one you say is so handsome?

112
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,710
Yes. When my son was young, his eyes were so pretty.

113
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,810
When I took him out, it was hard
to walk ten steps straight with him

114
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,220
because people asked so much if
they could hold him and touch him.

115
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,350
That son was even good at studying?

116
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,680
It's a difficult age for a dragon
to be born from a small stream.

117
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,290
(It's difficult to go from
rags to riches in this day and age.)

118
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,230
It's not a small stream.

119
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,330
What?

120
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,030
It's a very wide and blue sea.

121
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,370
What is she saying?

122
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,340
Do you have some great background
that I don't know about?

123
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,280
What is it? As if. What would she have? Seriously.

124
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,180
That ajumma knows how to subtly put on airs.

125
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,890
Yeah.

126
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,260
Unni Jin Ok can't come today? Why?

127
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,200
She was scammed?

128
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,840
You want me to h-hold it?

129
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,310
The rumors have already spread all over this
place that I was scammed by con artists.

130
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,680
I'm so embarrassed that I can't even face anyone.

131
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,420
Jang Jin Ok, the name that used to
have influence everywhere I went,

132
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,720
has become one that I can't use anywhere now!

133
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,690
Then... simply change your name.
It only takes a week.

134
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,530
Do you really want to die!

135
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,900
No. I have to be cool-headed about this.

136
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,800
I-I have to be cool-headed about this.

137
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,140
Here. Take this.

138
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,240
Okay. Then what should we do now?

139
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,680
We should catch them.

140
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,020
That's right. No amount of money is too large.

141
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,490
Catch them. After screwing up my good son's life,

142
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,960
making me this embarrassed, and making
my husband go through a tax audit...

143
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,290
I mean... Can he persecute us like
this just because we have money?

144
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,000
Of course not.

145
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,430
Make sure to catch them,

146
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:27,740
especially the punk who pretended to be
a prosecutor. Make sure to catch him.

147
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,440
Even if you have to kill him, catch him.

148
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,020
Ah! You scared me.

149
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,490
Hey! You scared me.

150
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,820
Hey, hey. Why are you acting like this?

151
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,190
You came recently.

152
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,060
Yes.

153
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,830
You were born in 1980, year of the tiger, right?

154
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,130
Your parents didn't register
your birth early or late, right?

155
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:07,080
Do you look at any half good-looking
man with that kind of nauseating gaze?

156
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,080
Are you a crazed fan of pretty-faced men?

157
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,390
Fine. Watch, watch. Watch as much as you want.

158
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,190
I'm going to sleep.

159
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,300
I'll hear the good news first.

160
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,230
The good news is...

161
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,760
Ah dah...

162
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
Ah dah...

163
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,530
What are you doing?

164
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,500
Did you stay up all night like that?

165
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,710
How old are you that
you've fallen for a celebrity?

166
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,440
Are you a crazy fan girl?

167
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,780
Stop watching and give it here.

168
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,890
Hello?

169
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah, Nam Doo Hyung.

170
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,860
Yeah, big problem.

171
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,230
We didn't realize that Myeong Dong Capital

172
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,960
was a scary place.

173
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,870
As expected, the private loan businesses
("loan-sharking") have an organized framework.

174
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,270
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, they sent some people.

175
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,940
Usually they don't send people on overseas
business trips in this type of peak season.

176
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,710
The plane tickets are twice as expensive.
They must have been really mad.

177
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,480
- Hyung, were you caught?  - No, you!

178
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,980
They say you were caught!

179
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,420
Did you perhaps just
take the phone you used before?

180
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,350
Why did you do that, so unlike
yourself, in this global satellite age?

181
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,920
You must have been GPS tracked.

182
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,720
Then... What are you saying?
Are they coming here right now?

183
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,130
- Aish, then hurry and hang up.  - Wait, wait, wait!

184
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,600
- Why? - You know, that bracelet...

185
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
You want to go ahead and send that
bracelet to me? By international post?

186
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You trust me, right? You trust me.

187
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,710
We'd better go our separate ways now.

188
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,420
You, think hard where your house is.

189
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,990
If you really don't know,
request the help of a government office.

190
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,490
I have something urgent that's come up right now.

191
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,140
I'm screwed. Screwed, screwed.

192
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,080
It's far.

193
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,390
Calm down. Calm down, Joon Jae.

194
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,630
Hey, hurry up and find him!

195
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,910
Get down!

196
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,820
Find them!

197
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,140
Hyungnim!

198
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,180
Get them! Get them!

199
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,550
Take this!

200
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,150
Hey!

201
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,890
Hyungnim! Hey!

202
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,730
Get on, quick! Sit here.

203
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,760
Are you okay? You didn't get hurt, did you?

204
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,200
I was worried that they might keep chasing us,

205
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,400
but they couldn't keep up with my speed.

206
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,810
But what you need to understand is that it's all
thanks to me that we were able to get out of it.

207
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,310
No way other guys would have made it.

208
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,110
They are there!

209
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,080
Hey, move quickly!

210
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,820
Let's go.

211
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,390
Stop right there!

212
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,130
Oh! Stairs!

213
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,450
This way.

214
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,820
Stay here for a moment, okay?

215
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,780
Hey, come over here!

216
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,020
Come, quick!

217
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,490
Come! Come and get me!

218
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,430
Aish!

219
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,230
Really!

220
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,600
Here they are!

221
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,290
Yeah!

222
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,520
You will drop your gun.

223
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,290
Do you have a death wish?

224
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,930
I knew Boss was a boss for a reason.
You've got strong mentality.

225
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,730
Shut up. What do you want to do?

226
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,330
If I shoot you here, the European cops
will come and things will get complicated.

227
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,770
I hate making things complicated.
I like to keep things simple.

228
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,140
Get in the car, then. Let's take the simple route.

229
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,410
Yes, sir!

230
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:16,620
I'm sorry, you must have been
startled. Oh my. Let's go.

231
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,670
Leave.

232
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,320
Oh? What's that, Boss?

233
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,740
Isn't she the girl who was flying
around and kicking our butts earlier?

234
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,610
Is that really a bicycle?

235
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,790
Speed up, you idiot!

236
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,320
Yes, Boss!

237
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,600
We are slower than a bicycle! Hit the gas!

238
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,630
Yes, Boss.

239
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,780
Run her over!

240
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,310
Hey! Hey!

241
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,650
You!

242
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,120
Gun, gun!

243
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,990
Get him.

244
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,690
Get him!

245
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,690
Let's go!

246
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,330
Move, move!

247
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,870
Get them!

248
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,640
Aren't you following? Hurry and go get them!

249
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,100
You stop right there!

250
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,350
Stop right there!

251
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,140
Listen to me carefully. If we turn the corner
and there is a guy, I'll take care of him.

252
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,410
No matter what, you turn back and run, okay?

253
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,800
I can normally do this anyway,
and today I feel especially grea...

254
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,770
Where did she go?

255
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,310
Hey! Hey!

256
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:36,580
Hey! Hey! Did that idiot get caught?

257
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,050
Hey, ding-dong! I told you to follow me.
Where did you run off to?

258
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,490
If you get in trouble one more time,
I'm abandoning you.

259
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,600
What? Hey, where are you going?

260
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,640
How did you find the exit?

261
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,240
Good job, ding-dong.

262
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,680

It's only five euros. Five euros is...

282
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,960
How can he treat her like that over
such a little thing? Hey! Hey! Hey!

283
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,730
How much is it?

284
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,530
Five euros.

285
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,250
Do you have it in a small size?

286
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,190
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

287
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,330
Go, go! What patience... ??

288
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,920
Yeah, it's me, Joon Jae.

289
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,790
I heard about you recently.
That you're working in Sitges.

290
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,630
I'm around there.

291
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,500
I can't use my cell phone or credit
cards, and I don't have any cash.

292
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,440
Really? Thanks. Where do I have to go?

293
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,340
Where?

294
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,220
Preacher Heo No Ah?

295
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,690
- Hallelujah!- Hallelujah!

296
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,390
Wow!

297
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,800
Hey, how long has it been?

298
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,500
I know. I guess we haven't seen each other
since the ministry in Libya, so two years?

299
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,210
Pastor, this is Evangelist Heo
No Ah who's like my brother.

300
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,340
Now he's carrying out
ministries of saving baby elephants

301
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,480
and making water wells in Kenya, Africa.

302
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,090
Wow, you're really doing difficult work.

303
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:38,320
Since God has given me the job,
I'm serving with a thankful heart.

304
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,000
This is my wife.

305
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,200
She got in an accident few years back,
and she's not quite mentally alright.

306
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,510
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

307
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,770
Father.

308
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,440
She must've been shocked pretty badly.
She's got aphasia and can't really talk...

309
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,280
When will I be able to hear my wife's voice?

310
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,690
Hello. Nice to meet you. The weather is quite hot.

311
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,870
Hey, what happened?

312
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:29,940
Why are you talking suddenly?
Did you get the gift of tongues?

313
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,310
You said you wanted to hear my voice.

314
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,480
- That's true. That's true, but...  - But...

315
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,290
What's a wife? You said that I'm your wife.

316
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:51,330
- It's nothing. It means friend. Friend. - Friend.

317
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:58,240
What is this? You were able to
talk all this time, but you didn't?

318
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,070
You're outrageous!

319
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,840
It was pretty hard until yesterday,
but I mastered it with the box you gave me.

320
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:10,220
Our language, in other words,
our language of the nation...

321
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,980
The box I gave you?

322
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,790
The laptop? You learned from that?

323
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,090
Are you a netizen?

324
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,830
What are you looking at?

325
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,630
- Your eyeballs.  - My what?

326
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:32,500
The ink in your eyeballs. They're sparkling.

327
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:39,180
Mine have always been sparkling like that.

328
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,080
They're pretty.

329
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,020
Right? They're pretty, right?
My eyes have always been pretty.

330
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:56,160
My mom said it was hard to walk more
than ten steps when she took me out.

331
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,400
Because people always asked if
they could touch me and hold me.

332
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,670
But it's not "eyeballs," it's "eyes."

333
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,470
It's not "ink", but "pupil."

334
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:14,010
When did you learn all that
gangster language? Are you a sponge?

335
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,180
Your absorbing power is amazing.

336
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,420
You prepared what I asked for, right?

337
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,690
Of course. We're members of the CMC.
Con-artists from Mensa Club. We're buddies!

338
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:31,200
- Thanks.  - No, I'm not doing this for free.

339
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,270
What do you want?

340
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,400
I already made all the arrangements.

341
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,170
We will do a final practice.
Sister Shin, testimony please.

342
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,910
This is all a blessing from God.
Five minutes before the market closing,

343
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:56,150
he made me meet Trader David McDouglas
and enabled me to tithe 10,000 euros!

344
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:03,160
Then people will be stirred up wondering
who is this Trader David McDouglas?

345
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,930
I want to get to know him, too.
Then David walks out to say one thing.

346
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,140
Very humbly!

347
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,710
I'm no hero. I'm but an instrument...

348
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,510
I just heard God's voice. If we fail and flop,

349
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,650
we have a lot of ways to get out of this. At this
moment, our group of responders go, "Hallelujah!"

350
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,180
Hallelujah!

351
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,060
- Do you get it?  - Yes.

352
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,490
This is a special place.

353
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,560
So? What are you telling me to do?

354
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,500
You just simply

355
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:44,740
sing a special song. Something that would
numb the rationality and touch the emotion.

356
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,200
What?

357
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:53,480
♫ Love is always patient

358
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:00,190
♫ Love is always kind

359
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:08,160
♫ Out of faith, hope, and love,

360
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,600
♫ The greatest of these is love.

361
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,970
♫ The greatest of these

362
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,040
Wow!

363
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,550
♫ is love.

364
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,810
The rooms are small. I don't know if they'll
be big enough for you two to stay in.

365
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,470
It's okay for now.

366
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,940
I'm thirsty. I want water.

367
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,650
- Water fountain is there.  - Over there.

368
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,720
I'm so thankful that your wife started

369
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,360
to communicate with the world again.

370
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,500
I know. Please pray for my
wife's fragile body and heart—

371
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,940
I was going to ask for prayer,

372
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,510
but she seems to be stronger already.

373
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,110
Amen.

374
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,420
Aren't you full?

375
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,920
I didn't think you'd actually
finish the whole jug, seriously.

376
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,220
What's love?

377
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,990
Huh?

378
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:52,030
You sang earlier that the greatest
of all is love. What is love?

379
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,800
Oh.

380
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:00,770
Love is... actually something quite dangerous.

381
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,240
It's better for someone like you to not do.

382
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,510
Why?

383
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,620
Let's say that you love someone.

384
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,190
That means you surrender.

385
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,620
What's surrender?

386
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,800
To lose. You lost. In other words,
if you love someone,

387
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,200
then you believe whatever he tells you.

388
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,400
That means you're in big trouble.

389
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,310
So should you say something
like that to someone or not?

390
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,140
I love you.

391
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,120
Don't! I told you!

392
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,920
I'm hungry.

393
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,890
I think...

394
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,530
you have amnesia.

395
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,630
That's why you don't remember things.

396
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,200
Look at my eyes.

397
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,780
I don't mean to stare at me like that.

398
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,790
Anyway, take a deep breath and think
about your parents when I count to three.

399
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,350
Got it?

400
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,890
One, two, three.

401
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,030
What are parents?

402
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:36,100
Are you stupid? You don't even know what parents
mean? Your mom, father, who gave birth to you.

403
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,600
I don't have those.

404
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,710
Well, I guess not everybody has them.

405
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,380
Do you have parents?

406
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,320
I have a father but he is the same as nonexistent.

407
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,920
Mom...

408
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,430
I wish I had one.

409
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,700
That's why I'm going.

410
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,060
Where?

411
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,900
To the end of the world.

412
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:14,040
There is a place like that.
What's your name anyway?

413
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,680
- I don't have a name.  - Right.

414
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,120
It's not even surprising anymore.
You have so many weird things.

415
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:29,190
If I wasn't weird and had a name,

416
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,060
I could be with you all the time, right?

417
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,000
No... That's not what I mean.

418
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,530
There are so many weirdos in this world.

419
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,800
Honestly, you are not even close to being one.

420
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,110
- Really?  - Of course!

421
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,510
I'm the one who's really weird.

422
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,580
You are a good person.

423
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,220
What do you know about what kind of person I am?

424
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,960
My hand...

425
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,900
You could've left me but
you held it. Several times.

426
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,870
You are a good person.

427
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,480
I've taken and run away many times,

428
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,180
but this is the first time I'm
giving back something I've taken.

429
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,690
Fine. Let's go together. Together.

430
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,900
To the end of the world.

431
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,810
Hercules.

432
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:40,990
Thank you.

433
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,960
No, thank you. Thanks to you we
got some big offerings yesterday.

434
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,360
And there are a lot of people signing up
to support our trader, David McDouglas.

435
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,200
Okay. Good luck. Bye.

436
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,000
Be aware of him.

437
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,200
You're my style.

438
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,770
If you get a chance, we should
meet in Seoul sometime...

439
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,840
Where is Seoul?

440
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,240
Where is Seoul...

441
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,780
What a coincidence that you and I
have the same sense of humor. I...

442
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,290
I will give you my number. It's really valuable
since I rarely give out my private number.

443
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,890
We're running late. We're going.

444
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,690
That's too bad.

445
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:24,760
Oh, Evangelist Thomas!

446
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,570
- Thank you so much.  - I haven't done anything.

447
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,700
- Don't pretend you don't know. Evangelist
Heo already passed everything on. - What?

448
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:37,280
You said to use this to help out the
students in need with their tuition.

449
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,220
Are you crying?

450
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,390
No, I'm not.

451
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:50,520
I think you are.

452
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,560
- Umm, Pastor.  - Yes.

453
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,730
- So I really can't kill an enemy? - What?

454
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,730
Won't it be okay to kill just the enemy?

455
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,800
Wow, our Thomas sure knows a lot of cuss words, huh?

456
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,710
How was it? Did you like it?

457
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:12,310
See you in Seoul. I'll pay for the meal.

458
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:16,680
Why does everybody say to meet in Seoul?
Where is Seoul?

459
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,820
You really don't know Seoul?
You've never been there?

460
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,790
Are you going to Seoul soon?

461
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,560
Yeah. That's where I live.

462
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,860
This is the end of the world?

463
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:09,840
Yes. People here called it that since
the lighthouse was built 2,000 years ago.

464
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,340
There is the ocean. Why is it the end?

465
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,180
The ocean starts from here.

466
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:31,120
Joon Jae, a long time ago, people believed
that this was the end of the world.

467
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:38,800
That lighthouse is the Tower of Hercules
that lights the end of the world.

468
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:46,240
Hercules' mom came here every day
longing for her estranged son.

469
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,010
People felt sorry for her,
so they built that lighthouse

470
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,380
so Hercules could follow the
light from that lighthouse

471
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,180
to find his mom through the ocean.

472
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:05,020
So? Did Hercules come and find his mom?

473
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,030
I'm not sure.

474
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,630
But there is a legend.

475
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:15,470
It says people who separate
here will surely meet again.

476
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:20,740
Could it be because although
this is the end of the world,

477
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,010
this is also where another world begins?

478
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:32,380
But Mom, I think Hercules probably

479
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,120
missed his mom a lot, too.

480
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:46,470
Heo Joon Jae, that's my name.

481
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,740
There aren't many people who know
my real name. You should be honored.

482
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:59,510
So if you separate from here,
you can really meet again?

483
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,880
I think it's a lie. I separated with my mom here.

484
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,990
But... I still haven't met her yet.

485
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,990
Mom!

486
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,460
Mom!

487
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,660
Mom...

488
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
Mom.

489
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,740
Mom. Mom...

490
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:37,280
My mom... left without even saying
goodbye... without any manners.

491
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,630
There's 'Heo Joon Jae' here, too.

492
00:50:55,470 --> 00:51:01,040
I love you, Heo Joon Jae (written in Korean along
with inscriptions in Greek and Roman alphabet)

493
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,780
I love you, Heo Joon Jae.

494
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:26,060
That's right. So there is 'Heo Joon Jae' here, too.

495
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:31,800
Mom... did say goodbye to me?

496
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:36,110
What did Mom say?

497
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,710
- That she loves me. - She loves you?

498
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,320
That she lost?

499
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,280
She surrendered?

500
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:53,090
Yeah. She said she totally lost! She surrendered.

501
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,530
Hercules!

502
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,780
Let's run.

503
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,680
Aish! Catch him!

504
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,060
Ah, seriously!

505
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,860
Hey, you can see this, right?

506
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,830
I can't just let you leave today!

507
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:21,370
Okay. Even if you are going to shoot,
let's talk after letting her go.

508
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:23,880
She is a girl and has no
connection with this at all.

509
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:31,150
Hey! No connection? If she is not connected, why
did she follow you so persistently yesterday?

510
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:37,990
Well, that's because I stole something
from her... This, this! A bracelet!

511
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:42,990
This is a cheap thing, but I stole it,
and that's why she kept following me.

512
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,870
Hey, Go over there!

513
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,870
I gave it back to you! Go!

514
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:00,010
Why? I am your wife.

515
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,880
Heol!

516
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,890
This jerk!

517
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,530
How dare you try to con us?

518
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:18,530
No, the "wife" that she is
talking about doesn't mean that.

519
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,300
Ah, I am celibate!

520
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,630
I don't even know this girl's name. Seriously!

521
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:26,640
Shut up! Just way one more word.
I'm going to just shoot!

522
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,140
Yes, sir!

523
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:34,750
Why are you saying useless things?
You should have left when I told you to go.

524
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,950
What are you going to do now?

525
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:44,120
Hey, why are you looking down there?

526
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:51,460
I have a fear of heights and water.
It's better to just be shot at lightly—

527
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,230
Being shot won't do. You will die like a dolphin.

528
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:58,000
Of course. But I will die when I drown, too.

529
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,270
Let me try to persuade them,
so you go first. Go first—

530
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,440
Ahhh, okay, okay, okay. Wait a minute!

531
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,650
Wait, wait, wait! What's wrong with you? Seriously?!

532
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,380
Calm down! Calm.

533
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,900
Shouldn't we catch them?

534
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,530
Look for them!

535
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:37,440
♬ A door to the new world is open ♬

536
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,950

537

♬ I'm going towards you ♬

538

♬ And want to be embraced by you ♬

539
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:57,160

542
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,510
♬ I need you; I love you ♬

♬ Forever, in your arms ♬

544
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:19,790
If I wasn't weird and had a name,

545
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:24,220
I could be with you all the time, right?

546
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,460
♬ I'm going towards you ♬

547
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,390

♬ Forever, in your arms ♬

553
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:57,260
♬ There are still a lot of

554
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,290
♬ Your world, your heart ♬

♬ Show them to me ♬

556
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,700
Everything that got excavated from
the ocean is so amazing, right?

557
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,210
Right. I hope to discover the wood panel quickly.

558
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:20,580
The owner has a special eye for it.

559
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,950
Totally my style.

560
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,560
What is this?

561
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,230
Huh?

562
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,790
What is it?

563
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,060
This picture.

564
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,640
The Legend of the Blue Sea

565
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,250
Which way to Seoul? Where is Seoul?

566
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,050
I am not seducing you to go to Seoul.

567
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:59,280
There are so many thing that
you would like in Seoul.

568
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,250
Things like really
good specialty restaurants.

569
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,890
Seoul seems big, right?

570
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,820
It's as big as a palm.

571
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,930
As one lives, everyone crosses
paths briefly by chance sometime.

572
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,560
It's just that people don't know that fact.
