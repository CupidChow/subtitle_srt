1
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,680
If you leave me or leave this
world, my heart beat stops.

2
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,250
Jung Hoon died because of that, too.

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,030
The loved one leaves, the heart
cools, hardens, and stops.

4
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,800
Without you, I'll be like that, too.

5
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,970
Unless I return to the ocean, I'll probably die.

6
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,770
You're going to die?

7
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,750
What did you say?

8
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,780
- What did you just say?  - What?

9
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,890
Say it again. What will stop, harden...
What will happen?

10
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,690
You hear my voice?

11
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,830
You said your heart will stop.

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,330
Since when did you start hearing it?

13
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,700
- You said you're going to die.
- When did you start hearing it?

14
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,800
Why are you going to die?!

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,540
You! Since when have you known so much?

16
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,580
From the start to the end, everything.

17
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,980
Who I am... and where I am from, you know all of it?

18
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,950
I know. I remember everything.

19
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,690
The crazy bastard who shared an
umbrella with you when it rained,

20
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,430
the player who took your hand when you were
alone, the whacko who cooked ramen for you,

21
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,000
were all me.

22
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:07,840
That you were the one who saved me from drowning
and also the mermaid who erased my memory.

23
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,940
You remember all of that?

24
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,580
That's right. I remembered it all.

25
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,520
How?

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,950
Now answer me. What are you saying about dying?

27
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,620
What is that you are saying
about your heart stopping?

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,760
Didn't you say you heard it all?

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,390
Those things.

30
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,730
Are all those true?

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,500
That if I am gone, your heart would stop?

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,640
That you... will die?

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,180
You heard it all.
You said you were listening to my voice.

34
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,020
That's right. It's just as you heard.
This is not my world.

35
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,660
Once I gave up being in water and came here,

36
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,460
pettily, I got to have a
heart that beats only for you.

37
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,900
So you're saying... if I die, you die too?

38
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,940
That's right.

39
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,140
So if anything happens to
you that you would be gone...

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,210
Don't say things that I, by myself,

41
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,020
will experience good things and live
happily. I can't make such a promise.

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,790
Anyway, once you are gone, I will be gone too.

43
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,430
If you didn't love that woman

44
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,770
and if that woman did not love you, you
would not have reached such a tragic end.

45
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,560
The love you have for each other
would end up killing each other.

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,410
What other worse ill-fate is there?

47
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,050
So Ma Dae Young was not the problem.

48
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:03,020
I... could be the one to kill you then.

49
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,060
Heo Joon Jae, that's not it.

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,960
The Legend of the Blue Sea

51
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,360
Episode 15

52
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,920
Are you thinking that this
will all repeat once again?

53
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,690
If you stop here and let that woman
return to where she was originally,

54
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,200
shouldn't you be able to
avoid that miserable end?

55
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,940
Did you guys fight big time?

56
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,110
No.

57
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,040
Why is Cheong crying?

58
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,310
Is she crying a lot?

59
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,950
She was wailing her heart out.

60
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,010
Hey, you...

61
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,720
if you aren't going to take responsibility
until the end, how about settling at about now—

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,090
Why is everyone telling me to settle things?

63
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,290
I haven't even done anything for her. Did
I do anything aside from making her cry?

64
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,960
Did I make her cry? You're the one who
did, so why get mad at me?

65
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,700
Hyung.

66
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,310
What?

67
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,910
When Cheong came to find me... it was from her greed.

68
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,550
But not sending Cheong away...
I think it's from my greed.

69
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,990
What are you saying?

70
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,130
But then, I know it's from my greed,

71
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,660
but I keep not wanting to hear the
reasons why I should send her back.

72
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,030
I keep wanting to make excuses of
how I don't have to send her off.

73
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,440
If things continue like this,
something bad could really happen to her.

74
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,910
But then, since earlier

75
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,410
Cheong... I keep getting a feeling that
I need to get a debt back from her.

76
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,750
This... I think I remember but not...

77
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,280
What do you keep on talking about
something you think you remember but don't?

78
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,520
Why hit me?

79
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,700
What is your secret?

80
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,070
My secret is... that I am different from you.

81
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,150
That I... am a mermaid.

82
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,350
That's right, it was from then on.

83
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,390
I could have been in big trouble.

84
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,860
If I fell in the water I would
have been totally exposed.

85
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,960
Hey, if you slip and fall,
at the very least you'd get a concussion.

86
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,370
He knew back then.

87
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,200
He knew it all.

88
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,140
He knew...What does he mean?

89
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,440
Does he mean not to think of him?

90
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,980
What does that gaze mean?

91
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,110
Is he mad? At me? Why?

92
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,720
Now, it's nice and quiet.

93
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,690
Starting now, don't think of anything.

94
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,260
And don't do anything.

95
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,230
He knew everything but why did he do that?

96
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,560
I have something to ask.

97
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,130
What?

98
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,030
Honestly, I thought no one was home and
while swimming I was caught by Jo Nam Doo.

99
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:44,970
But then Jo Nam Doo became a totally different
person. He threatened to sell me for money.

100
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,010
So I erased his memory.

101
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,780
But how was it for you?

102
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,990
Even though you knew who I am,
did you not hate me or get scared?

103
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,590
Is that important to you now?

104
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,060
Yeah. This is important to me.

105
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,140
That's right. I didn't hate you or get scared.

106
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,280
Just, since you were an
unusual person from the start

107
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,780
I thought that's how you were. Just like that.

108
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,880
That's a relief.

109
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,620
That's enough for me. As long as you didn't hate me.

110
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,670
Honestly, since I know that
I got caught I am happy.

111
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,530
I always thought, every night before I slept,

112
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,800
whether I would get caught today or tomorrow.

113
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,970
If I were to get caught,
what would your expression be?

114
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,370
Your facial expression of you hating me

115
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,680
was my scariest dream.

116
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,080
To me, the scariest dream is

117
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,820
that everything would repeat itself.

118
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,660
A dream that everything would repeat itself?

119
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,340
Why did we come here?

120
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,610
You asked what's repeating.

121
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,910
I'll teach you.

122
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,150
Gallery of Yangyang's Shipwreck Artifacts

123
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,070
Huh?

124
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,180
I know what you're thinking
but I'm better looking.

125
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,680
Who is he?

126
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,230
A man... who loved a mermaid.

127
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,750
This man nearly drowned in
water when he was little.

128
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,460
The mermaid saved his life.

129
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,100
And the two spent a long time
together and fell in love.

130
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,570
But the man married another woman.

131
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,840
On the first night of marriage,
the man ran away from the bridal room.

132
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,650
Se Hwa! Se Hwa!

133
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,320
He risked his life and jumped in the ocean

134
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,490
to meet the mermaid again.

135
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,660
In order to prevent the boy
from looking for her again,

136
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,930
she erased all his memories by kissing him.

137
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,730
Time passed,

138
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,140
and the two met again as adults.

139
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,010
And the relationship that
seemed to be broken off for good

140
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,880
started again.

141
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,250
So? So what happens?

142
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,800
Hmm? What happens?

143
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,940
You said you'll tell me what repeats.

144
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,020
Those two...

145
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,600
Your favorite, soft persimmon.

147

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,880
You didn't know?

149
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:32,520
♬ The indistinct thought of someone who was ♬

150

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,000

♬ our connection which was brief  ♬

155
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,320
Those two... lived happily.

156
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,230
Not getting sick nor hurt.

157
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,870
Having lots of kids and raising them well.

158

♬ I'm afraid that being under the same sky as you ♬

159
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,070

♬ Will be erased ♬

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,750
I see.

162
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,280
Yes, they did.  ♬ If we can walk ♬

163
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,090
That's their story that I saw.
♬  as far as the blue horizon of the sea♬

164
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:48,460
♬I won't let go of your hand.♬

165
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,300
But why

166
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,830
am I tearing up?

167
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,480
Come here.

168
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,900
They must have seen us in their dreams, too.

169
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,870
Then why is it a scary dream?

170
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,940
Huh?

171
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,740
It's a beautiful dream.

172
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,710
Right.

173
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,420
You're scared that a
beautiful dream is repeating?

174
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,790
Hey. You can't be so loud here.

175
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,060
It bothers other people.

176
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,990
What other people?

177
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,430
Why? What are you scared of?

178
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,570
It's just that we're in a
different situation than back then.

179
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,740
What's different?

180
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,510
You said so. If you continue to stay here,

181
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,880
you might die.

182
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,480
If you stay by me and love me,
my heart will continue to beat.

183
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,620
It's probably the same for them too
since they lived happily ever after.

184
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,290
I'm not that man.

185
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,860
What do you mean?

186
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,700
I'm saying I can't be sure of my heart.

187
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,400
The easiest thing that can change
in the world is a person's heart.

188
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,070
That's why those lovey-dovey couples break up,

189
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,240
and the marriage that was thought
to last forever ends, too.

190
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,880
Knowing that your life depends on
my heart which I don't even know—

191
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,380
So you're scared of that?

192
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,550
Yeah. I'm scared of that.

193
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,060
- What?  - It's not fair.

194
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,500
How come you can hear my
heart, but I can't hear yours?

195
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,070
Why do you need to hear my heart?

196
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,470
From a person who only tells the truth.

197
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,010
Don't swear. I can hear it all.

198
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,020
Chief Nam's wife; 011-837-9238

199
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,460
The number you have dialed is not available.

200
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,890
- I have a good idea. Let's do this, Heo Joon Jae. - Hm?

201
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,960
I'd hate to have you feel
burdened or scared because of me.

202
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,560
So?

203
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,600
Let's just erase yesterday. Just yesterday.

204
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,470
- What?  - If we just erase yesterday from your brain,

205
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,170
we can go back to how we used to be.
You won't feel burdened and stuff.

206
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,170
What are you saying?

207
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,880
I can do it. If I just control my strength well...

208
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,050
I think I can get it to work.

209
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,580
Get what to work?

210
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,150
It's not that easy in the water,

211
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,150
and I'm a little short on stamina
since I've been on land for so long.

212
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,760
But I'll try my best, hmm? Not a lot but just a little.

213
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,960
I'd say maybe a day or half a day.

214
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,030
What is this girl talking about?

215
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,360
Just tightly close your eyes and bear with me.

216
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,400
Why close my eyes?!

217
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,370
It won't hurt. Wait just a moment.

218
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,710
Hey, don't come near me! What are you doing?

219
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,910
It won't hurt. Just trust in me and leave it to me.

220
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,450
Hey.

221
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,230
Jeez! What's with you!

222
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,360
Hey!

223
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,270
Hey, wait. Wait up. Wait!

224
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,000
Hey!

225
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,370
Hey.

226
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,480
Hey! You really!

227
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,380
Stop. Are you really going to be like that? Hey!

228
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:42,020
Hey, what are those guys doing?
Are they playing catch me if you can now?

229
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,380
Yesterday she was crying like
the earth had collapsed

230
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,530
and she was heaving and crying up a storm.

231
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,430
Hey!

232
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,360
I hope the day clears up soon

233
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,470
so I don't have to see all these
ridiculous things and can take off.

234
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,700
Hold on!

235
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,370
I think I just have to erase half a day.

236
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,650
I really can't?

237
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,250
Close the door.

238
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,150
It would be great if I could
just erase half the day.

239
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,490
Would erasing the day make
it so that nothing happened?

240
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,930
I told you. What are you going to do if I
change my heart and don't like you anymore?

241
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,490
Heo Joon Jae, I'm a mermaid with a
great amount of insight for people.

242
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,060
Do you think that I would've come this far to
follow some man who changes his mind so quickly?

243
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,870
I knew it the moment I saw you. "This is the man."

244
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,170
Someone who's worth hanging
my once in a lifetime love on.

245
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,870
You said that there was
something wrong with your eyes.

246
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,610
What?  There was something wrong with
my eyes. I was so naive back then.

247
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,490
What do I know when
I lived my entire life in the water,

248
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,550
and it's the first time I came on land? Heo Joon Jae
was just the first man I encountered.

249
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,390
You said you came here thinking I was the best.

250
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,790
You thought I was the only
handsome guy in the world...

251
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,060
When I watch TV, there are so many. He's
a patient suffering from prince syndrome.

252
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,830
You said I was too into myself!

253
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,300
So you heard it all?
You can think anything when you're mad.

254
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,410
It's that you're a bit narrow-hearted to pretend
you didn't hear anything

255
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,570
when you heard everything.

256
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,740
Okay, then. How about we erase all that as well?

257
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,780
- You heard me talking behind your back. How
petty of you. - Hey don't come down! Hey!

258
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,750
I think we'd be good if we erase about one week.

259
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,650
Now that we're on the subject,
do you want to go to the East Sea?

260
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,490
Or should I get you a plane ticket
to go somewhere? Like Boracay?

261
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,160
That ocean must be nice and warm.

262
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,130
I'll visit you from time to time.
I can see you when I'm surfing and stuff.

263
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,900
Fine. I won't do anything to you.
Let's just sleep holding hands.

264
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,140
I'm serious. I won't do anything. I'll just
sleep holding your hand. Don't you trust me?

265
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,410
Totally not.

266
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,110
He's not falling for it.

267
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,650
I can hear all that.
You're doing so well for yourself.

268
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,130
You're a mermaid that's supposed
to be innocent and ignorant,

269
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,250
but you're so vulgar and base, even lying!

270
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,770
I'm telling you to go read some
fairytales in your spare time.

271
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,490
Among your ancestors there wasn't anyone
who's as much of a playgirl as you!

272
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,500
Geez.

273
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,000
You sure you won't do anything to me?

274
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,740
Nope. I promise.

275
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,980
Don't do anything. I'll just
check if your heart is doing okay.

276
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,290
It's beating well.

277
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,390
It beats totally fine when I'm next to you.

278
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,650
What? She was their household helper?

279
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,180
Yes.

280
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,220
I was wondering where she was hiding...

281
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,830
No wonder I couldn't find her
since she was a house helper.

282
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,070
What's wrong? You don't like it?

283
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,840
No, it's good. You should try, too.

284
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,510
Go to that house right now.

285
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,590
Oh, Madam, you really surprised me.

286
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,850
What brings you here so suddenly?

287
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,190
You know you've been contacting
me but I couldn't get back to you.

288
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,360
- Please have a seat.  - Okay.

289
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,330
Then... That incident that day.

290
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,270
Are you going to magnanimously pass it over?

291
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,970
Of course. Anybody could be
like that when they're drunk.

292
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,010
Oh, thank you.

293
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,580
Can I stay for some tea?

294
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,020
Of course. Is coffee okay with you?

295
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,750
Yes.

296
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:13,060
Ahjumma! Bring us two delicious cups
of coffee please! I request of you.

297
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,830
Yes.

298
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,500
She's the one that's making
us the side dishes, right?

299
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,740
Yes. You said the chairman
especially liked them.

300
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,740
What can be done? She said that she's going to quit.

301
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,850
Quitting?

302
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,180
Yes. She's such a good worker.

303
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,520
She must have an offer from
somewhere else or something.

304
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,920
She suddenly told me that she's quitting.

305
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,170
Ahjumma, what are you doing?

306
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:18,260
Ajumma your cooking skills are so superb.

307
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,030
We've really been enjoying your food.

308
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I heard you're quitting.

309
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,540
Have you decided where to go?
If not, how about my house?

310
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,480
Yeah?

311
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,910
Can I go to your place? (Speaking informally)

312
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,620
Oh my! Ajumma, are you drunk? W-What are you doing?

313
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,960
Can I cook at your house?

314
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,260
You won't give up the master
bedroom but the kitchen's okay?

315
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,300
I don't know why you're here
or what you want to verify.

316
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,070
You got me wrong.

317
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,780
The only reason that I was
living as if I were dead

318
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,610
is because harm might come to my Joon Jae.

319
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,220
Now I have nothing to stop me.

320
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,790
Jin Joo.

321
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,790
Please excuse us for a second.

322
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,000
- Of course.  - You told me once,

323
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,900
there is a mean-hearted woman who stole
her friend's husband and took her place.

324
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,470
You didn't know where the original
wife, who got kicked out, is.

325
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,610
Did I... speak so... crudely?

326
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,180
Did I?

327
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,280
It's me.

328
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,650
That original wife who got kicked out.

329
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,590
And this person is

330
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,060
that mean-hearted bitch.

331
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,460
Oh my God. H-How...

332
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,050
Ye In's mom!

333
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:25,350
What a great happening so early in the year!

334
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,790
You know, you know.
Our house is the site of history!

335
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,990
I think it's going to be the site of history.

336
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,000
Get ready to be swept off your
feet and listen carefully.

337
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,290
Hyung, did you look into finding that
Kang Ji Hyeon I told you about before?

338
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,820
Yeah, I did search,

339
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,130
but I've never done any investigation
as goosebump worthy as this one.

340
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,330
The people and things surrounding
this woman are all suspicious.

341
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,100
She married twice and both of her
husbands died after becoming blind.

342
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,170
But she had an alibi and they were diagnosed,

343
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,970
so Kang Ji Hyeon won the entirety of
the insurance after their deaths.

344
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,910
But that's not all, everyone.

345
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,250
This woman is an orphan so she was adopted,
but all of her adopted family members

346
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,820
died mysteriously.

347
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,620
Is that for real?

348
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,150
We just got goosebumps.

349
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,090
So what about now? Where is she?

350
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,260
We cannot know her current whereabouts at all.

351
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,340
But if it's a woman of her class,

352
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,100
I'm thinking she's probably living
under a different identity. What do you think?

353
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,600
But the thing is,
there's another astonishing fact.

354
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,670
Stop leaking the info piece by
piece but reveal it all in one go.

355
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,910
I have to do it like this for there to be
a thrill. Another astonishing fact is that

356
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,010
this Kang Ji Hyun is from Jecheon.

357
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,680
I kept wondering where the hell I
kept seeing her high school name,

358
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,880
but it was from during the time that I looked for
your mother. She was from the same high school.

359
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,220
Graduation Certificate  Daneon
Girls' High School Hong Yeong Jik

360
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:38,350
Honey, this is your personal secretary who
came in place of General Secretary Nam.

361
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,320
Chairman, I'll do my best (to assist you).

362
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,160
Goodness, it's me who has to rely on your effort.

363
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,500
Then, I'll start the car.

364
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,600
Okay.

365
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,280
My gosh, never you mind. I'll do it.

366
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,780
Please take a seat.

367
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:17,390
Madam, I was really sorry today.

368
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,800
I realize that you still
haven't found the new person,

369
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,500
but I'd like to quit after
setting up dinner tonight.

370
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,370
Unni (Big sis).

371
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,300
Wh-a-a...?

372
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,440
You would be a big sis whether you
look at it from age or whatever else.

373
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,770
It's not like I have an older
biological sister, and...

374
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,580
from now on, I'll think of
you as my biological sister.

375
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,280
Ma'am.

376
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,620
You don't have to work. That's right.
However, if you were to leave here,

377
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,120
it's not like you'd have a suitable place to go,

378
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,520
so just pretend like this is your
biological younger sister's home,

379
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,290
and stay on comfortably.
This is what I hope you'd do.

380
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,930
How can I?

381
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:05,270
Unni! I really thought I was watching...
a great historical drama!

382
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,720
You were the Queen Consort In Hyeon
and Kang Seo Hee,

383
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,610
that wench, is Consort Hee of
the Jang Family (Jang Hee Bin - royal femme fatale).

384
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,490
However,

385
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:19,450
the important thing is that the Queen Consort
In Hyeon eventually returned to her place.

386
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,390
I, Ahn Jin Joo, am going to help with that.

387
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,430
Your brilliant return to
the Queen Consort position.

388
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,900
I have no intention of doing so.

389
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:40,470
No, no. Unni, even if you don't have any intention,
you should do it, least of all for me.

390
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:48,310
Whatever it may be, I will help you Unni.
I will never let you leave the status quo.

391
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,050
Please just know that.

392
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,190
Agassi (Husband's younger sister),

393
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,360
you knew all along, didn't you?

394
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,060
Isn't that why you were
groveling to Ajumma recently?

395
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,960
What could you mean?

396
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,270
You knew our ajumma

397
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,570
was Chairman Heo Il Joong's faithful first wife
(wife through sickness or in health)!

398
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,300
What?

399
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,670
You mean you had no inkling?

400
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,440
What in the world are you talking...?

401
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,710
I can't even count the number
of times I've told this story.

402
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,610
But no matter how many iterations I run
through, my heart still beats this wildly.

403
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:26,650
You know our ajumma was the original
wife of Chairman Heo Il Joong!

404
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,320
But without having any idea, I've been supplying
the food Ajumma has cooked to that house!

405
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,730
Isn't it so dramatic?

406
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,230
Then Joon Jae is...

407
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,760
Joon Jae? You know that household's son?

408
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,730
Not so. How would I know that?
It's just my friend's name.

409
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,170
But seriously, that son who ran away from home,

410
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,940
that son's name must be Heo Joon Jae.

411
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,680
A little while ago, Ajumma was uttering
something about my Joon Jae or something.

412
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,730
Yes, Noona.

413
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,070
Were you awaiting my call?

414
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,710
Otherwise, how does one pick up his
phone before it rings even once?

415
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,340
It's not that, but I was gaming...

416
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,910
Never mind.
Listen without getting all frazzled.

417
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,750
Will you come to pick me up?

418
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,750
Now?

419
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,220
Are you that happy? That's right. Now.

420
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,390
But you can't have any ulterior motive, alright?

421
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,570
Where are you going?

422
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,370
Noona Si Ah asked me to come to the club.

423
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:55,140
Really? Is that a place with good water
(atmosphere of the club)? Let's go together.

424
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,440
Is that a place with fresh water (literally good
quality water to swim in)? I want to go, too.

425
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,110
- You'd go too? - Yeah.

426
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,620
What? How dare you...

427
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,760
What? What? I'm not usually
the one who gets flagged.

428
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,230
It's not that but your attire is somewhat...

429
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,360
Ah... Cheong.

430
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,770
Okay?

431
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,370
Wow, today you're full of swag, Cheong! Let's go!

432
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,570
Cha Si Ah!

433
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,370
I told you to come alone, so why drag the unwanted?

434
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,910
Cha Si Ah, were you coming
to such a nice place alone?

435
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,480
Cha Si Ah, don't drink. Last time when I saw
Heo Joon Jae drink, he became a little cuter.

436
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:15,150
It depends on the person. In the case of
Cha Si Ah, she always telephones and cries,

437
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,620
and prohibits you from hanging
up on her all night, and...

438
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,960
I got it. I'm hitting the dance floor.

439
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,110
I'm a safe guy.

440
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:43,850
As there are so many unsavory
incidents, my hands are always up above.

441
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:48,120
Don't worry about a thing and just dance.
Just dance.

442
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,530
Your eyes are so pretty.

443
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,800
Yes, what?

444
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,560
Where is everyone?

445
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,240
Ah, Detective Heo. Have you returned
from your investigation? We're at a club.

446
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,910
- What about Cheong? - Of course, she came with us.

447
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,710
Why would you bring her there?

448
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,580
She'll say she's dizzy and won't like it.

449
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,880
What are you talking about? She's moving through
space fluidly.  She's completely at home here.

450
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,520
What?

451
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Move over. Move!

452
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,840
Hey Joon Jae, what brings you here?

453
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,640
Oh. Just because.

454
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,310
It's really fun here. Let's play.

455
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,850
I'd like to but I still have things to do.

456
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,020
Have fun with Hyung Nam Doo and Tae Oh.

457
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,220
Make sure you ask to be
taken home when you're done.

458
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,090
You come here. Stop.

459
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,460
Heo Joon Jae!

460
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,930
Why? I'm going to dance some more.

461
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,160
Are you sweating?

462
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,900
Yep. The dancing is making me
a little warm. But I like it!

463
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,270
I bet you like it, alright. Come on out.

464
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,940
Why? I'm going to dance some more.

465
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,740
Right. Come here.

466
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,740
My gosh.

467
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,260
It's raining a lot.

468
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,900
This turns out to be one of the
things I cannot do together with you.

469
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,070
Walking when it's raining.

470
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,140
I can't.

471
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,850
There's nothing you can't do. Wait a minute here.

472
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,590
♬  The moment I looked at you ♬

473
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,730
♬  one step closer ♬

474
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,700
Where did you find this?

475
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Don't say, "I won't" or "I can't" from now on.

476
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,740
I will let you do every single thing people who
live here do without leaving anything out.

477
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,450
So you should know this.

478
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:40,920
♬ Like this shining so
blindly when I look at you ♬

479
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:49,730
♬  You are my only one, if we get to love ♬

480
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:57,770
♬ My one. If my one love can begin with you. ♬

481
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,890
♬The heart that I've been guarding preciously

482
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:06,210
and a love for which we don't know the meaning ♬

483
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:15,350
♬ For you I will use it for you.
Each and every moment of mine ♬

484
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,790
♬ for you. ♬

485
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,800
It's so interesting.
How did that ajussi hear your thoughts?

486
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,970
I don't know. How did you come to hear me?

487
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,610
I don't know. I just heard it as well.

488
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:43,350
Anyway, I feel less burdened now
that Heo Joon Jae can hear me.

489
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,820
It's not like I have anything to lie about.
It's like I can now live properly here.

490
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,090
Normally, like everyone else.

491
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,090
But you know, having lived my
life, even though it appears easy,

492
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:59,770
the thing that's most difficult is
living normally like everyone else.

493
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:05,800
I will make sure I do this: getting old
together like everyone else with Heo Joon Jae.

494
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,090
All those women over there appear
to be holding luxury bags, right?

495
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,420
But look at them carefully.

496
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,830
They're carrying their bags overhead because
they don't have an umbrella. Those are knockoffs.

497
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,730
And look at that woman behind.

498
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:37,740
You see she's carrying her bag like it's
some ancestral tablet. That's genuine.

499
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,320
Can knockoff be rained on?

500
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,710
The knockoff is not that different
than the original real designer product, no?

501
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:46,610
Though the outer appearance could be the same,
but there is one thing that can't be deceived.

502
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,580
- What is that? - The heart of the bag owner.

503
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:55,850
You know you can't deceive the owner.
They know that their bags are fake

504
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:59,520
which is why they hold them like
umbrellas and run when it rains.

505
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,960
But among the bag owners,
whether the bag is real or fake,

506
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,720
there could be someone

507
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,500
who will like it and treat it nicely
simply because it belongs to them.

508
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,440
I'm just saying that it could be. I feel like
I'm a fake in this world for some reason.

509
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,510
Still, I feel that despite being a fake,
perhaps I deserve to be loved by someone.

510
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,550
Be that as it may, why are you so earnest?
I was trying to be funny.

511
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,660
You were trying to say that one shouldn't divide
the real vs. fake by the outer appearance, right?

512
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,230
- Yes.- You're so bright, summarizing so well.

513
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,970
Thank you, you two. I'm going to try all
things that other people do normally.

514
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,270
Speaking of that, tomorrow is my birthday party.

515
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,440
- Is tomorrow your birthday? - Do you celebrate
your solar or lunar calendar birthday?

516
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,450
I don't know.

517
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,560
Truthfully, I don't know when my birthday is,
so I just decided to make it tomorrow.

518
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,980
What's the date tomorrow, anyway?

519
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,050
January 5th. It's a succinct date. Nice.

520
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,690
- Where is the party? - At my house.

521
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,000
I tend to refrain from
visiting other people's houses,

522
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,760
but I'll come tomorrow especially for you.

523
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,630
- Do you have any special Saeng Seon (fish)
in mind you'd like to have? - Mackerel.

524
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,600
- Not that kind of Saeng Seon (fish) but Saeng
Il (birthday) Seon Mool (present). - Ah.

525
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:22,410
Can't you just give me Mackerel
for a birthday present?

526
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,110
Ah, yes, Han Gyeol.

527
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm going to drop by the house right now. You
come home right after your academy, too.

528
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:37,960
I'll prepare a late night snack for you. I
have to come back to the hospital right after.

529
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,630
Department Head.

530
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,000
You look a lot better.

531
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,370
It's been really chilly out lately. Oh yeah.

532
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:32,610
I saw you talking with Joon Jae the other day.

533
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,650
Can you answer my questions, too?

534
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:47,290
If Ma Dae Young made you like this, why did he?

535
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:06,980
Is the person you think is associated
with Ma Dae Young my mother?

536
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:18,760
Of course. I knew it.

537
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:31,570
Mother seems to feel
relieved about the fact that

538
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,870
you're lying down like this, not saying a word.

539
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,980
But this isn't an issue about speaking.

540
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,650
Right? The problem is...

541
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,150
here.

542
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,650
It's your mind.

543
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,200
Something that can betray us anytime,

544
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,270
your mind.

545
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:15,650
- Hello? - Han Gyeol's mom?

546
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,150
It's me. Joon Jae's mom.

547
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,850
Oh my, madam. How long has it been?

548
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,620
It is you.

549
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:30,230
I'm in a rush, so I'll get straight to it.
Has Joon Jae not been studying abroad?

550
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:34,830
I heard he left the house. Is it true?

551
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:40,810
I'm so sorry. I actually lied at that time.

552
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,880
I thought you would be too upset.

553
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:51,480
So do you know how Joon Jae's been doing?

554
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:59,020
Yes, I do. A while ago, my husband got into a big
accident and has been lying in the hospital,

555
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,930
and Joon Jae sometimes visits.

556
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,600
His phone number... Could you give it to me?

557
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,540
Of course.

558
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,830
Madam, I can't really read small letters.

559
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:15,570
I'll quickly go upstairs and get my glasses,
so I can read it to you.

560
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:18,480
Don't hang up, and wait.

561
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,880
Honey!

562
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,160
He's lost consciousness, has no heartbeat,
and isn't breathing. I will start CPR.

563
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,290
- Honey! What happened! Honey!
- You are not allowed to enter here.

564
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,560
- No, honey! - Please wait outside.

565
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,400
Don't forget my request.

566
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,070
Look here. If you ask such a request
of me , how am I supposed to live?

567
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:23,140
I will meet you again, as a good friend.

568
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,240
Ahjusshi's your friend.

569
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,420
Bring mom back. Bring mom back.

570
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,160
Honey! Honey!

571
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,530
Ma'am! Are you okay?

572
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,470
Who are you?

573
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,440
If you cut off his air supply like
that, the alarm goes off.

574
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,640
Luckily, it was when they were switching shifts.
You could have been in a lot of trouble.

575
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,380
Aren't you a fugitive?
Why are you driving my father's car?

576
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,050
From now on, don't take the
initiative in doing anything.

577
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:44,360
Just think about why your mother quietly
hides and watches. Just think about that.

578
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,260
Don't talk nonsense!

579
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,590
I'm asking you why a dangerous person
like you is hovering over my mother and me?!

580
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,600
What, you jerk?!

581
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:58,600
Listen to me well. You only need to be quiet
and benefit from what others do for you.

582
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:04,440
Don't overturn a table which is
already set. Do you understand?

583
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,750
Hello? Han Kyeol's mother?

584
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,550
Cheong.

585
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,390
Yes. Tomorrow is my birthday,

586
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:21,330
and we're going to have a birthday
party at the house. Can you come?

587
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:25,630
What to do? I'm so sorry.
I'm not in a situation where I can go.

588
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:29,330
I would have prepared a present
if you had told me ahead of time.

589
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:34,270
It's okay. I didn't really know when
my birthday was so I decided today

590
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:36,480
tomorrow would be it.

591
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,950
Then you've never had a birthday
party since you were born?

592
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,980
No. It's the first time.

593
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,920
Your parents aren't alive?

594
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,650
No.

595
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,360
I'll come. Where do I have to go tomorrow?

596
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,880
I don't know. Out of the blue she said
she wants to have her birthday party.

597
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,560
Yeah. She says she doesn't even
know when her birthday really is.

598
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,950
She says she just decided it is today.

599
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:24,690
Aiyoo, thank you. Aiyoo, you're so pretty. Hey, we're
going to have to get rid of the TV or something.

600
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:28,390
She keeps seeing bad things on
dramas and wanting to follow them.

601
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,060
All right. I'll be right there.

602
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:40,340
Who are you?

603
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,310
Oh, she's my friend. Welcome.

604
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,180
Your friend?

605
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,580
What is this? Is it food waste?

606
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,610
Come on now,
what are you talking about food waste?

607
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:52,380
It's mackerel because the lady of
the house said she likes it.

608
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,150
But don't you have house slippers here?

609
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,720
The lady of the house?

610
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,060
Oh, oh, oh! Do-o-o-on't j-j-j-just sit
down and s-s-s-sit with this under you!

611
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,270
Don't you give steamed towels here to wash your
hands? They usually give things like that.

612
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,460
I don't usually eat raw foods because
I'm used to only eating cooked foods.

613
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,200
Yes, there's codfish soup here so at least
have some codfish soup with rice later.

614
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,670
But the cod doesn't seem to be wild cod.

615
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,670
Codfish soup has to have fish intestines in it,
but it doesn't have that either.

616
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,240
- So are you not going to eat?
- Of course, I have to eat it.

617
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,740
It's still a party. I can't wreck the mood.
Do you have jalapeños?

618
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:00,520
Yes, Cheong. I've just gotten off
the bus and I'm walking there.

619
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,720
Hello.

620
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,490
Why did you come out?

621
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,560
What's all this?

622
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,950
Things like sea urchin seaweed soup,

623
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:09,630
japchae (stir-fried glass noodles),
and bulgogi (grilled marinated beef).

624
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,390
They were the things that I used to make a
long ago for him for his birthday.

625
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,030
I don't know if they'll suit your tastes.

626
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:19,970
After deciding that today is my birthday,
I feel somewhat like I've been reborn.

627
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,440
The feeling of having been giving
permission to live a new life here?

628
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,480
I'm trying to organize my life and
leave the house I've been living in.

629
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,580
I was hiding all this time.

630
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:34,990
Now, I will find the person I want to find, say
what I want to... I want to live like that.

631
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,340
Oh. It's my dummy.

632
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:22,030
What is she so happy about?
She smiles easily, so prettily.

633
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,170
Who?

634
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:59,340
My boyfriend. Heo Joon Jae!

635
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:05,580
That dummy. I told her so many times not to call
my name out loud when there's a lot of people.

636
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:11,080
Heo Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!

637
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,020
Hello!

638
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,920
Your boyfriend's name is Heo Joon Jae?

639
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,360
Yes. He's really good looking.

640
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,300
Heo Joon Jae's mom said that when he was young...

641
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,310
If I was taken outside,
it was hard to even take ten steps

642
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:39,240
because people always
wanted to touch and hug me.

643
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:50,190
What's wrong?

644
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:54,890
My son's name is the same.

645
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:01,630
Heo Joon Jae. We got separated when he was young.

646
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,640
I haven't seen him for a long time.

647
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,840
The Tower of Hercules?

648
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:17,350
They say Hercules' mom came here every day and
longed for her son whom she was parted from.

649
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:22,120
After seeing that, the people who
felt bad for her built that lighthouse

650
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,460
so that Hercules would follow
the light from the lighthouse.

651
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,260
They say they prayed for him to
cross the sea and find his mother.

652
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,100
So? Did Hercules find his mom?

653
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:43,210
I'm not sure. But they have a legend here.

654
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:47,280
People with whom you get separated from
here, you will meet them again for sure.

655
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:05,630
Heo Joon Jae, what the legend of
the lighthouse stated is true.

656
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:10,370
That those who get separated
there will surely meet again.

657
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,070
That they meet again and love.

658
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,310
Congratulations. You get to see your mom now.
