1
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,750
There doesn't exist any human on earth who
can accept our existence the way we are.

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,990
The guy you claim to love would be the same.

3
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,100
Hence...

4
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,500
Get a hold of yourself

5
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,070
and never be found out.

6
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,970
Don't come this way, Heo Joon Jae!

7
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,360
You! What are you doing there?

8
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,030
I said don't come this way. Stay away!

9
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,970
Oh, right. Okay, okay, okay. I won't look.

10
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,930
Wait a second. What do you take me for—

11
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,900
I said turn around!

12
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,910
- Hey. - Don't turn around!

13
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,740
I said I won't look.

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,580
Hey, what I told you was to clean the house.

15
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,720
When did I tell you to get in the
water and play around? Seriously...

16
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,420
Don't turn around! Don't turn around!

17
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,350
Ah, I'm only trying to shut the door. Just the door!

18
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,020
The-the-the door. Don't shut the door.
Don't shut the door.

19
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,490
Gawd, what will you have me do?

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,260
Nothing! Don't do anything!

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,570
- Let me just as you one question.- Don't even ask.

22
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,810
I'm all done.

23
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,320
What is all done?

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,450
What's the one question you had?

25
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,790
Huh?

26
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,920
Ah, right...

27
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:36,800
Should you or shouldn't you be so careless
in a house full of men like that...

28
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,270
I didn't anticipate your sudden return.

29
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,280
Should you or shouldn't you return home
so suddenly after you leave the house?

30
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,450
It's MY house. This house exists so that I can

31
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,720
go out and return suddenly as I see fit.
This house right here.

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,460
Should the burden of care that one
must take fall on you or on me?

33
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,990
- On you.  - Not true. It should be on you!

34
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,030
To put it bluntly,
you are really lucky because it was me.

35
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,330
Just imagine what you would have done, if
this happened when the other punks were here.

36
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,400
- What makes you the lucky option?  - Because I...

37
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,550
Are you engaging in a repartee with me?
Quickly go and change your clothes.

38
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,650
I can only dress when you leave.

39
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,050
Right?

40
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,040
Episode 8

41
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
What took you so long?

42
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,970
- Huh?- What about your cell phone? Did you get it?

43
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,310
- I'll just go.- You'll just go?

44
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,550
It's okay. Let's just go.

45
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,890
Ah, wait, wait a minute.

46
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,720
I have an announcement to make...

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,990
From now on, when you return home, ring the
door bell at least once before you enter.

48
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,230
- What's the reason? - I'll be doing the same. I will.

49
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,460
So, ring the door bell before you enter.

50
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,030
Make some noise to announce
your presence once as well.

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,940
So I'm asking as to WHY do we have to do this?

52
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Geez, why do you question the request
the owner of the house is making?

53
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,390
As for you Tae Oh.

54
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,910
Don't you enter by silently picking the
lock and stuff. I'm telling you to watch it.

55
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,950
- What nonsense... - You'd better watch it!

56
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,480
Why is it...so hot?

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,880
- Hot you say? - Aren't you?

58
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,450
- They say it's below freezing. - It's so oddly hot.

59
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,720
As you say, your face is red.

60
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,460
You mean you were almost found out?

61
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,270
It could have been a big problem.
I told you to be careful.

62
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,590
From his perspective,
he'll continue to poke around

63
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,110
and question this and that since you're
suspicious, telling you to fess up your secret.

64
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,640
He's already doing that now.

65
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,780
"What happened in Spain? Why can't I
remember? If you won't say, get out."

66
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,090
You can't get sucked into
that strategy and fess up.

67
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,020
You can never be "mermaiding out."
(Like coming out)

68
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,850
Uhm. Never will I be "mermaiding out."

69
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,190
What little consolation that a
thing called "lie" exists here.

70
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,090
Would that have worked in our neck of the woods?

71
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,600
You know that as soon as I think of something,

72
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,100
everyone within 10Km radius
knows everything in my heart.

73
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,930
True.

74
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,800
At least here, we can hide our real feelings
with a lie since they can't hear our thoughts.

75
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,070
Do people really lie so much?

76
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,480
Not only do they lie a lot, but they
lie every time they open their mouths.

77
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,910
Have you mastered Hangeul (Korean alphabet)?

78
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,350
Then what does it say there.Free
phone 100%... The boss is crazy!

79
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,320
Free phone 100%... The boss is crazy!

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,020
Do you suppose that statement is true,
and it means that the boss is crazy?

81
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,720
- That's not what it means?  - No, of course it isn't.

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,960
Since we'll recoup the cost
using any means necessary,

83
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,460
all you need to do is come and spend
your money. That's what it means.

84
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,760
Ah, is that what it means?

85
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,470
When you go to the department
stores, the employees

86
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,500
always tell you, "This attire suits you perfectly.
It was made for you!" no matter what you wear, right?

87
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,740
Do you know what it means?

88
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,810
- Doesn't that mean it looks pretty?  - Come now.

89
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,760
- (It means) since I gave you
the lip-service (compliment)

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,780
you ought to be a mensch and buy something.

91
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,750
And this is the important point.

92
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,850
In this place, the word "love" is very common.

93
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,560
But you can't be deceived by that.
It doesn't mean (they) really love you.

94
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,090
Want to see?

95
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,300
I love you, Dear Customer~

96
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,030
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,050
Just because someone said
"I love you" to you, if you suggest, "Shall we date?"

98
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,240
then you'll have a major problem.

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,110
You will be shackled.

100
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,010
It's difficult.

101
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,450
Then how can you tell when
people are lying to you?

102
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,980
It's not easy.

103
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,820
One of the methods I've found thus far is...

104
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,260
people who lie either can't meet your eye,

105
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,460
stutter, or touch their ears.

106
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,230
At times they touch their lips or cross
their arms to take a defensive posture.

107
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,640
What do you mean? How do I notice Cheong?

108
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,470
Not true? You seem to care a
lot about Cheong these days.

109
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,410
To-ho-tally not at all.

110
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,940
Honestly, this is the first time
I've seen you do that to a woman.

111
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,210
Demanding a dress code
(length of skirt, skin showing).

112
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,480
Ah, come on. You know I had
given you the dress code too.

113
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,550
Furthermore, I pay attention
to Tae Oh's clothes too.

114
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,620
Hey, how come do you dress so thinly these days?

115
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,220
Shall I buy you a parka?

116
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,000
- I don't quite think that's it. - That is it.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,530
- Just drop me off right up there.
- Why? Don't you want to go together?

118
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,400
You agreed to check out the
gallery for our work together.

119
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,200
Can't the two of you just go together by now?

120
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,110
I have some other matter to take care of.

121
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,140
Why? To meet with Si Ah?

122
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,920
What a pleasant surprise without
even calling ahead? What's up?

123
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,240
You told me last time that a
several hundred-year-old shipwreck

124
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,560
was discovered in the Yangyang ocean.

125
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,260
You remembered it despite the
appearance of partially listening to it.

126
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,370
Nam Doo Hyung told me yesterday
that its mokgan was discovered.

127
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,970
That's right. That's why my research
office is in such an uproar.

128
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,410
And the... name of owner of the items is...

129
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,410
Kim Dam Ryeong.

130
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,210
He was the chief of the village
of Heupgok named Kim Dam Ryeong.

131
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,430
(Mokgan: a small wooden
panel that recorded the ship's origin,

132
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,580
destination, and purpose of the journey)

133
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
This is the item.

134
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,460
Just by looking at the year inscribed on the
mokgan, it is certainly a mid-Joseon era item,

135
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,930
but look at the clothes the male is wearing.

136
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,130
They match modern day clothing as if
it were drawn with the future in mind.

137
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,240
In addition, isn't it truly
mystical to see a mermaid?

138
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,970
It's as you say.

139
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,300
Legend of the Blue Sea

140
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,270
Lately, it's been strange.

141
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,710
Not to mention having a
strange, repeating dream...

142
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,580
When I was looking at the
illustration on that vase...

143
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,890
Gosh, this might really sound crazy, but

144
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,560
I felt like the male in the
illustration was definitely me.

145
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,360
It isn't as if I recall anything.

146
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,030
I've done a fair amount of clinical
experiments and such to bring about

147
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,000
a short-term memory loss via brief
cognitive hypnosis, but this is different.

148
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,410
It's as if only a specific portion of
my memory of being in Spain was erased.

149
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,180
Is this type of thing possible, Professor?

150
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,350
Well, dissociative phenomena is,

151
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,750
in the end, an issue of separation (dissociation),
so I can't say that it is completely impossible.

152
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,090
An episodic amnesia can
sporadically happen as well.

153
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,730
(Chae Gye Sung amnesia: memory loss
specific to an event or a person)

154
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,340
Now your memory for that person

155
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,710
will go back where it started.

156
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,100
Are you okay, Joon Jae?
What did you see? Do you remember?

157
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Professor Park.

158
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,710
Yes, Joon Jae. Tell me everything you saw.

159
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,650
Professor told me before

160
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,880
that hypnosis can bring out my subconscious

161
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,120
but can also possibly bring out illusion.

162
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,260
I said so.

163
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,360
I think that's what I see, the illusion.

164
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,900
Otherwise,

165
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,200
this doesn't make sense.

166
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,240
Whoa, you're the best player in the whole country?

167
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,210
Not just within your guild,
but in the whole country?

168
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,060
Heo Joon Jae!

169
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,230
- Are you going somewhere?- Yes, I—

170
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,230
Never mind. I don't need to know. Please go ahead.

171
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,430
Alright.

172
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,800
But... Starting today, we have a curfew.

173
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,840
- We do? - Yes, starting today.

174
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,270
What time?

175
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,650
Eight PM. Come back by eight, or else we'll
lock the door and won't let you back in.

176
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,250
Hey, it's 7:30.

177
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,920
That's what I mean. She needs to come back by eight.

178
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,720
Where in Seoul would she go if
she needs to come back in 30 mins?

179
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,420
You might as well tell her not to go.

180
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,690
Who's telling her not to go?

181
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,790
Go. I don't know with whom she's meeting up.

182
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,030
Anyway, whoever that guy...

183
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,500
Wait, I don't even know if
she's meeting a guy or a girl.

184
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,070
Anyway, after she meets whomever
that unknown person may be,

185
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,170
she needs to come back by eight.

186
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,380
If she doesn't like it, she can
simply stay away from here permanently.

187
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,980
The 7th Level Civil Servant Breaking Through

188
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,680
Whose book is this? The 7th Grade Civil Servant?

189
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,020
- Are you trying to become a civil
servant?- Are you in your right mind?

190
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,350
I was just reading it,
thinking it might help with our work.

191
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,720
It's what kind of study people do these days.

192
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,730
I was curious. As a matter of analyzing a trend.

193
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,060
Are you going out?

194
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,470
No, I won't. I'll just go out tomorrow.

195
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,670
Well, then.

196
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,250
He's strange, really.

197
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,720
Where were you going to go at this hour, my Cheong?

198
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,150
- I was going out to make money.- Making
money? You mean doing a part-time work?

199
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,920
No, I was going to exchange these for money.

200
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,090
After exchanging them, I was going to
give all the money to Heo Joon Jae.

201
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,730
What are these?

202
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,100
Oh, these...

203
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,640
Where did you get them?

204
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,210
I got them by working hard.

205
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,200
What kind of work do you need to do
to get these high-quality pearls?

206
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,020
You've become even more mysterious.

207
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,300
You need to appear on
an investigation program, "Tell Me the Truth".

208
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,610
- Can you give me one of these?- No.

209
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,180
I get it, I get it. I'll just look.

210
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,880
Whoa, these are of really high quality.

211
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,820
I have finished cooking yummy white rice.

212
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,020
Are you sure? Have you finished it for sure?

213
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,020
Good job, really.

214
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,500
Rice Cheong, Rice Cheong!

215
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,370
She's not Sim Cheong, but Rice Cheong!

216
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,720
Are you hurt?

217
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,590
Do you know why I work as a
life guard in this cold weather?

218
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,000
You don't have a place to sleep?

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,270
Hey, I rent a 30 Pyeong (100 sqm /1000 sqft)
apartment near Omokgyo subway station.

220
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,400
I make a decent living.

221
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,700
I also have a king-sized bed, a big one.

222
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,780
- Do you know why I'm here after all? - Why?

223
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,950
My heart has almost reached its limit.

224
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,950
I have to be in the water for a
few hours a day to survive the day.

225
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,090
Of course, I don't even know
when it will stop working.

226
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,160
- What do you do then?
Do you have any other way?- There is.

227
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,770
My love has to come back to me, but it won't work.

228
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,030
She's married to another guy.

229
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,600
Then quickly go back to the sea.
What are you doing here?

230
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,340
Look who's talking? What are you doing here?

231
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,510
If you had to erase his memory as
you were caught while saving him,

232
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:11,180
then you should just consider that a good
memory and go back to the sea where you live.

233
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,850
Who appreciates you for
keeping a forgotten promise?

234
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,620
Why did you come all the way here? For what?

235
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,880
To endure all the suspicion
and mistreatment to the extent of abuse?

236
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,530
And wonder when he'll love you?

237
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,030
You go back quickly when you still have a chance.

238
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,870
It's not too late for you.

239
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,040
How would I live when I go back? I will miss him.

240
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,540
That's why

241
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,880
I'm slowly dying here, too.

242
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,760
Even if I go back, my life is pretty much done.

243
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,290
If I die here, or go back to live the lifeless life.

244
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,960
I know all too well that it's all the same.

245
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,600
- Black plastic bag. - Got it.

246
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,720
Salmon swimming back due
to their homing instincts

247
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,690
or mermaids coming to land looking for
their love due to pure love instinct...

248
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,590
I wish someone would get rid of them, really!

249
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,200
I want to be reborn as a human in my next life

250
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,670
and date all these women and become a womanizer!

251
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,570
It is too harsh to have a heart
that's reserved for only one person.

252
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,640
How long would my heart last?

253
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,420
I am not sure. It's been two
months since my love left here.

254
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,750
You can probably guess from my
case to see how long I last.

255
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,960
Don't pity me. This is your future.

256
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,200
Black plastic bag.

257
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,420
We made a ruckus so recently. Would he come back?

258
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,360
You little...

259
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,830
He'll come back.

260
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,900
It looks like he was looking for something.
He will come back.

261
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,300
He's not dumb. Why would he come back?

262
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,180
Gosh. He startled me.

263
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,450
Dept Head Ajusshi Nam

264
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,220
The phone is turned off.
Please leave your message...

265
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,520
Ajusshi, this is Joon Jae.

266
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,160
Your phone has been turned off for
a long while. Please get back to me.

267
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,500
Pick it up.

268
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,370
- Me? - You shouldn't litter
with your cigarette butt.

269
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,680
What do you care?

270
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,520
Pick it up.

271
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,540
Ajusshi, this is Joon Jae.

272
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,040
I am...

273
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,480
Enter.

274
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,970
How long will my heart last?

275
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,040
Well,

276
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,710
since it's been two months since she left,

277
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,480
we will know by looking at how long I will last.

278
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,220
Don't look at me so pitifully.

279
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,520
This is your future.

280
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,970
I had to go somewhere and then came back.
Do you have some time?

281
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,940
I need to discuss something about your father.

282
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,880
Yes, I think I can make time tomorrow evening.

283
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,780
But are you doing alright these days?

284
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,020
Yea, everything is fine. I'll see you tomorrow.

285
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,560
I'll decide on the location
and will contact you again.

286
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,460
I'm relieved.

287
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,900
Heo Joon Jae, are you sleeping?

288
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,870
Why?

289
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,000
May I go down?

290
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
No.

291
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,280
What?

292
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,350
There's an urgent matter that I'm curious about.

293
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,580
- What is it?  - When do you
think you will start liking me?

294
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,990
- What? - I know that you don't like
me, but do you have any future...

295
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,360
- Plans? - Yes, that's right. Plans.
Do you have such a thing? Plans to love me.

296
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,230
- I don't. - You don't?

297
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,930
Right. I don't have any.

298
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,870
No, instead of answering so quickly, you should
think about it carefully before answering.

299
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,010
Do you really not have any plans?

300
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,930
I didn't know I was so good at naming people.

301
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,200
But, are you this dumb? ('Cheong' sounds the
same as the last character of dumb 'mungcheong')

302
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,340
Let me answer you again, so listen
carefully. I have no plans to love

303
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,340
or things like that at all.

304
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,580
It seems like it's hard for you to answer—

305
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,280
You couldn't hear?
I answered it really plainly just now.

306
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,320
I'll give you some time.

307
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,920
Aigoo, if you give me some time, should I accept it?

308
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:36,560
You know, for a person to like another person, is
it such an easy thing to do in just a few days?

309
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,530
That's the most difficult thing in the world.

310
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,700
Why?

311
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,800
That's because...

312
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,610
Listen carefully.

313
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,810
The easiest thing in the world is

314
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,780
to be disappointed by another person.

315
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,790
Even after liking someone
after his/her outer appearance,

316
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,290
one will quickly be disappointed.
That's how human beings are.

317
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,030
There is no one who
overcomes disappointment. So,

318
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,030
loving another person is
the most difficult thing.

319
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,730
It's not.

320
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,970
What's not?

321
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,840
For me, loving someone is the easiest thing to do.

322
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,410
Even when I tried so hard not to,

323
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,010
I couldn't help but love.

324
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:34,150
No matter how much I wanted to
be disappointed, I couldn't be.

325
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,060
For me, love overcomes everything.

326
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:56,240
If you have plans to like me in the future,
please do let me know, Heo Joon Jae.

327
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,730
Yes, Mother-in-law.

328
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,130
I was at Apgujeong Shopping
Mall Culture Center

329
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,270
and made a cutting board.

330
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,170
It's made with the highest quality wood
that came from the Amazon's rain forest.

331
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,410
I think it will live up to your kitchen level.

332
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:12,550
Yes, I will definitely bring
it on the weekend. Yes.

333
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:18,360
Mother, have a good night. Yes.

334
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,140
Unni, you are really amazing.

335
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,200
It's even hard for me to please my mom,
and you are just doing everything to satisfy her.

336
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,400
Should I...

337
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,940
give you a tip, Sister-in-law?
The way to control a man's heart.

338
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,910
A guy can't do anything to a woman

339
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,650
who is good to his mom.

340
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,320
What's that?

341
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,840
Take a look at your brother.

342
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,690
After playing around so hard, he ended up
marrying me, who treats his mom the best.

343
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,030
So, the man that you are delivering food to.

344
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:00,500
If you want to capture that man, then you
should capture his mom. That's what I'm saying.

345
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,600
But, then...

346
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:12,610
He doesn't talk about his family too much. He's
never said anything about his mom, either.

347
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:21,690
Where does he live? If she lives in Gangnam,
I can even find out which sauna she goes to.

348
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,560
Should I ask him discreetly?

349
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,260
Make him drunk and then work up to him to ask.

350
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,210
This is not the coffee that
I normally drink, is it?

351
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,710
We are all out of it.

352
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,810
I told you that I won't drink it
unless if it's the fair trade product.

353
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,450
Yes, I'll buy some more of that.

354
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,160
But, while it's good to be considerate towards
coffee planters in a faraway country,

355
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,290
I think having some manners towards a person

356
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,300
who lives in the same house is just as important.

357
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Ajumoni, are you trying to teach me now?

358
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,340
I wasn't not trying to teach,
but if you learned something, I am glad.

359
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,680
Unni, what's wrong with that ajumma?

360
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,850
She's always like that.

361
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,520
Just ignore her.

362
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,290
Miss, "How will I find out that
guy's mom and befriend her?"

363
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,130
You need to figure that out. That's the key.

364
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,460
Joon Jae's mom?

365
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,270
You should know something, Oppa.
Joon Jae never talks about his family.

366
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,140
If I say things like this to
you, he will be really upset.

367
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,340
Are you going to be like this?

368
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,810
Okay, okay. Then, tell me first.

369
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:59,350
- What? - Joon Jae came to visit you
at the Museum not too long ago, right?

370
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,020
- Yes. - Didn't he ask about something?

371
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,820
He asked if we've found the wooden inscription
panel. He said you told him about it.

372
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,990
- And? What else? - What else?

373
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,430
I showed him this.

374
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,970
Wow! What is this?

375
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,610
Is this a mermaid or something?
This is a fascinating painting.

376
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,710
- So the owner of this is also Dam
Ryeong, right? - Yes.

377
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,280
Wow, what is this?
There definitely is something to it.

378
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,820
It can't be just a coincidence.

379
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,150
Since I told you, tell me about Joon Jae's mom.

380
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,250
I don't know much, either,

381
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,930
other than they got separated when he was ten,
and that he is still looking for her.

382
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,860
They got separated?

383
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,830
I don't know where she is hiding.

384
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:51,970
She isn't leaving any trace, so we can't find
her. I'm wondering if she has passed away.

385
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,940
I want to find her for him. Where are you, Mother?
I am confident that I can treat her so well.

386
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:33,350
Yes, Lawyer Lee. Can we meet up tonight?
About the will.

387
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,720
I want it notarized.

388
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,950
Even if the beneficiary isn't there in person,

389
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,320
we can do it as long as we
have the resident ID, right?

390
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,560
Yes, that's possible.
I will see you later, Chairman.

391
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,860
He wants to notarize his will tonight.

392
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,440
It seems like he wants to officially
notarize the paperwork

393
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,210
to leave the majority of
his assets to Heo Joon Jae.

394
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,080
Why is he in such a hurry?

395
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,790
Cha Si Ah, let's have a talk.

396
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:20,090
You two should go ahead and talk.
I have somewhere to go so...

397
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,190
What about?

398
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,300
I have something I am curious about.

399
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,300
In this place, what should I
do for a guy to like a girl?

400
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,670
How would I know that?

401
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,710
You know. You do.

402
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,340
If you are in front of Heo Joon
Jae, you flip your hair like this.

403
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,680
When you drink water,
your fingers go like this. I saw it all.

404
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,920
Tell me what else should I do.

405
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,790
What are you asking me now?

406
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,490
If not, are you asking to fight it out today?

407
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,260
I am just asking. I'm in a rush that's why.

408
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,330
What's the rush about?

409
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,630
I want Heo Joon Jae to like me
back quickly. I have no time.

410
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,500
Ah, is that so?

411
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,570
Joon Jae is easy.

412
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,510
Easy?

413
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,840
Of course. Joon Jae is...

414
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,650
He likes not to be able to see a person. I
think that makes him long for that person.

415
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,030
If you are always in front of him and
hanging around him in one house like this,

416
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,220
that would be counterproductive.

417
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,830
In other words, he would get bored and sick of it.

418
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,230
Is that so?

419
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,230
That's what I'm telling you.

420
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,140
- Lies.- What?

421
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,740
When you speak, you don't look me in
the eyes; you touch your ears and hair.

422
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,320
I know it all, how all the people here
lie the moment they open their mouths.

423
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,640
I found out how to communicate with you, Cha Si Ah.

424
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,210
I just need to do the opposite
of what you just said, right?

425
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,350
Cha Si Ah, you can now go.

426
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,850
I will be lingering in front of Heo
Joon Jae and stick right next to him.

427
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,280
Wow, what kind of 100-year-old white fox
(someone extremely sly) is that?!

428
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,370
While acting all naive and everything...

429
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,410
So annoying.

430
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,290
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going, Heo Joon Jae?

431
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,490
- To the library.  - What is a library?

432
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,360
A place where you study.

433
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:41,300
Step aside. What's wrong with you today?
Always lingering around.

434
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,170
Did you get a plan? A plan of liking me?

435
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,510
Hey! What plan...

436
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,480
could possibly be formed in just a day?

437
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,170
I see that you don't have it yet. Okay.

438
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,850
I will give you more time.
But let's go to the library together.

439
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,850
So bothersome. Just stay home.

440
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,560
This girl. What about Hyung Nam Do?

441
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,700
He went out earlier.

442
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,870
Did he? He went out?

443
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,700
Tae Oh, what about you? Are you not going out?

444
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,810
I'm not. I will rest at home today.

445
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,380
Ah, really? At home.

446
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,580
Well, among us

447
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,320
- the one who should be going to
the library is you. - Is that so?

448
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,830
No matter how I look at it,
you still lack learning.

449
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,200
Totally, I'm totally lacking.

450
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,970
Oh, well. What else can we do then? Let's
go together to the library together then.

451
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,100
Nice.

452
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,140
Don't do that.

453
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,710
Hey, go and change clothes.
Hurry. I will just be here.

454
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,710
In here, choose a book and read.

455
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,870
I have to look for something
in the ancient documents section.

456
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,810
Heo Joon Jae!

457
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,950
- You need to be quiet here.- Why?

458
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,820
All of them are studying.

459
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,690
- I like the library. - Why?

460
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,820
I can whisper to you like this. I like whispering.

461
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:04,110
What is this? Every time I come to
the library, they pass me these notes.

462
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,510
I'm sorry but it's too loud. Can you go
out and talk or move to another place?

463
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,820
Why? What did she say?

464
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:14,020
She says she likes me and that I am handsome.

465
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,590
Hey. Hey.

466
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,700
Kim Dam Ryeong.

467
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,140
Fifth year of King Seonjo of
Joseon Dynasty: Year of Imshin.

468
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,770
Born on September 21, 1572.

469
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,640
He was married to Sung Kyung Sung, daughter
of the Minister of General Affairs.

470
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,350
The following year, his wife
passed away from a stomach disease.

471
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,920
After that, he did not remarry.

472
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,820
In spring of the 31st year of King
Seonjo, Year of Moosool, (1598)

473
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,990
he was appointed to be the town head
of Hyupgok village in Gangwon province.

474
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,730
In the same year, on December 11th,

475
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,130
at the young age of 27...

476
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,000
He died.

477
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,210
Did you have a nightmare?

478
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,020
These days, I keep having them.

479
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,580
It's to the point where I find it scary to sleep.

480
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,520
What is a dream and what is reality...

481
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,460
It's hard to determine.

482
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,230
You must be weak.

483
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,260
Is that it?

484
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,170
In spring of the 31st year of King
Seonjo, Year of Moosool, (1598)

485
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,160
he was appointed to be the town
head of Hyupgok village in Gangwon province.

486
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,810
In the same year, on December 11th,

487
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,680
at the young age of 27...

488
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,740
he died.

489
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,090
Look here, how much more time is
left until the full moon in December?

490
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,390
There are exactly 20 days left as of today.

491
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,160
Twenty days... Twenty days.

492
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:12,170
My Lord. I am sorry to say this,
but after treating this woman

493
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:17,410
I have found out that she is no ordinary being.

494
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:22,050
If what the people said is right,
that she really is a mermaid,

495
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:27,220
it seems like she won't be able
to recover if she stays here.

496
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,390
Then, what should I do?

497
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,330
You should hurry and send her back to the sea.

498
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:39,160
I believe that is the way to save her life.

499
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,060
Kim Dam Ryeong

500
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,790
Why did he die so early?

501
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,630
It's my age.

502
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,270
Mom! I picked this up.  Mermaid Princess

503
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:23,580
The mermaid princess looked
at the prince once more

504
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,580
and threw her body in the sea.

505
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,820
And she felt her body turn into sea foam.

506
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:40,790
Don't worry too much. He will wake up soon.

507
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,930
Thank you.

508
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:47,170
But then, no matter how I think about it, he
is not a person who would drink and drive.

509
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,170
That's what I am saying!

510
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,670
Can the black box not be recovered?

511
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,740
Yes, they said it could not.

512
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
You can't find his cellphone, either?

513
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,810
Oh, but the phone is under my name,

514
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:06,520
so I got all the records. But there was
nothing special before the accident.

515
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,720
This, can I take this?

516
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,960
I will look into it.

517
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,260
Will you please do so?

518
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,860
Among my friends, there are detectives
and prosecutors. I will ask around.

519
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,000
Thank you so much.

520
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,030
The madam told me not to
make things pointlessly big.

521
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,500
I had nowhere to ask.

522
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,470
Don't worry so much.

523
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,540
Thank you.

524
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,190
Joon Jae, later at 7...

525
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,960
Let's meet at Yeonheung-Dong 29-21.
I'll wait for you.

526
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,830
- Let's go. I'll take you home.-
No, I will go and meet my friend.

527
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,270
Who? That civil servant?

528
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,000
You, don't forget your curfew. Hurry and go home.

529
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,670
If not, I will kick you out.

530
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,840
It's eight! Okay?

531
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,620
- Honey.  - Honey, what brings you here suddenly?

532
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,690
I was nearby for some business,

533
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,730
and I came to eat with you
if you didn't have any plans.

534
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,200
Is that so? What should we do?
I have a prior appointment.

535
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,830
Is that so? What is it?

536
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:32,040
It's just a year-end party.

537
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,170
I see.

538
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,880
It's okay. It's not like I came
having plans with you already.

539
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
Wait.

540
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:46,350
- Yes, I was just leaving now.
- Chairman, I am so sorry.

541
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,260
Something urgent happened at home.
Can we set another date for this?

542
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,330
Okay. We can't do anything about that. Okay.

543
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,500
We can eat dinner together.
My appointment just got canceled.

544
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,800
Oh, my. That turned out well.

545
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,470
Honey, should we call Chi Hyeon so
we can have a cozy meal together?

546
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,710
Sure.

547
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,780
Who are you?

548
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,480
Is Yoo Jeong Hoon here? He's my friend?

549
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,920
- Are you perhaps, Kim Hye Jin?
- No, my name is Sim Cheong.

550
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,760
- Ah, is that so?  - Why is he not here today?

551
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,060
The truth is, that friend while saving a person
who fell in Han River a few days ago at dawn,

552
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:38,370
had a sudden heart attack. When he was
moved to the hospital, he was already dead.

553
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,880
Excuse me, are you perhaps
the person who called me?

554
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,820
- I am Kim Hye Jin. - Yes, I called you.

555
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:59,090
That person, what happened to him?

556
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,690
He died, you said?

557
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,200
I'm sorry.

558
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,200
That punk must have known something would
happen to him. I don't know how he knew.

559
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,140
He left this in his drawer
with your contact info.

560
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,290
Pink tinged? The one that comes
out when you're really happy?

561
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,330
That's right.

562
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,700
But then, when you stay here,
there aren't that many things that happen

563
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,570
that would make you cry out of happiness.
I only cried like that once.

564
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:51,880
While he stayed here,
he cried out of happiness only once.

565
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,890
He said he was so happy that
he cried because of you.

566
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:05,890
All those happy times,
he must have wanted to leave it here.

567
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,310
I didn't know he had a friend
he could tell these things to.

568
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,650
He was filled with so many secrets with me.

569
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:29,280
Did you leave him because
you detested the secrets?

570
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,190
Secrets are made because people are different,

571
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,320
because you would have to not
get caught being different.

572
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,330
That's why that secret, in the
end, gives each other wounds.

573
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,260
Both the person who is hiding something
and the person it is being hidden from...

574
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,630
They all get hurt.

575
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,070
That's why, if they are both different...

576
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,410
In the end, they can't go together.

577
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,480
You can't go together if you are different?

578
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,050
Anyway, you know that you would
only be giving pain to the other.

579
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:09,190
Would you be able to go together just
for the reason that you love that person?

580
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,460
Jeong Hoon told me he doesn't regret it.

581
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:24,300
Because it's a heart that beats for only one
person, even if it hardens and dies in the end,

582
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,970
he said he would not regret coming here.

583
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:35,810
When asked why he didn't erase the memories
when he was caught as his real self,

584
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:40,990
he said that there were too many good
times to be able to erase those memories.

585
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,490
He hoped that those memories
would stay with the person

586
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,200
that he loved and would give
that person strength.

587
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,800
I will be going now.

588
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,760
What kind of bastard is that?

589
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:39,470
What are you? You don't even have a
two-way radio. Are you really a cop?

590
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,790
Department Head Ajussi Nam

591
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,210
DepartmentHead Ajussi Nam

592
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,580
That surprised me!

593
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,050
Yeah, it's me.

594
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,820
Oh, Heo Joon Jae.

595
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,320
What's this? Why is your voice like that?
Are you sick?

596
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:08,190
Yeah. I think I'm a bit sick.

597
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,000
Where? Cheong, where are you? Are you at home?

598
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,440
Why are you there?

599
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,970
Stay there and wait. I will be right there.

600
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,880
Is it you?

601
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,190
The one who followed me not long ago and
pretended to be a cop in front of my house?

602
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,960
Where is Ahjussi? Why do you have his cellphone?

603
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,860
You have so many questions.

604
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,150
Why do you suppose I have so many?

605
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,100
It's because I want to get the
answers quickly and leave quickly.

606
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,740
Someone is waiting for me
so I have to hurry and go.

607
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,540
You can't go now.

608
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:30,440
The address here is Yeon Heung Dong 29-21.
It's the building not yet sold.

609
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,240
You can't come here with Tae
Oh within 30 minutes, right?

610
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,470
No, it just feels weird.

611
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:36,640
Should I call the police?

612
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,880
Go ahead, so that I can get caught at the same time.

613
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,750
Hey, if it's that strange then don't go in.

614
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:47,220
Call some bullet taxis nearby.
They would be faster than the police.

615
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,820
And don't forget to tell them to
honk the horn loudly when they come.

616
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:59,730
Come out. You need to get your money.

617
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,070
To the one who can go to Han River the
fastest, I will give ten times more.

618
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,110
Here.

619
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:23,320
Ahjussi, can you please go faster?

620
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,090
Yes.

621
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:30,630
The cellphone is turned off...

622
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,600
In times like this,
she doesn't charge the battery.

623
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:39,910
Please go faster. She's a bit sick and she's alone.

624
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,370
Aren't you more hurt?

625
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,610
Hurry and go.

626
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:52,980
Anyway, you know that you would
continue to give the other person pain.

627
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,420
Would you be able to go together?

628
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,030
Are we really not able to go together?

629
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:15,110
Where did she go? The weather is cold too.

630
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:33,930
You should go back quickly while you have
a chance. It's still not too late for you.

631
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,570
Should I go?

632
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,400
Where would you go?

633
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:57,580
♬ I am late again. For making you wait ♬

634
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:06,090
♬ I am sorry every moment you are smiling. ♬

635
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,090
Heo Joon Jae, are you alright?

636
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,130
What about you? Where are you hurt?
♬  Every precious day makes me fearful ♬

637
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,970
Did you perhaps get hurt while crossing
the street without paying attention again?

638
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:21,770
Joon Jae. Why did you get hurt, huh?

639
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:26,650
I'm asking you. Why are you hurt?

640
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:36,220
♬ I love you wherever and whenever I see you ♬

641
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,460
♬ If I see you like someone
receding in the distance ♬

642
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,430
Heo Joon Jae.

643
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:48,300
I can't tell you anything.

644
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,640
I am full of secrets.

645
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,640
But still, I don't want you

646
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:02,280
getting hurt, sick,
or wounded because of my secret.

647
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,520
I also don't like making you sad in the end.

648
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,050
♬ Even for the moment  ♬

649
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:12,020
And if you don't like it then...
♬  when I'm holding your hand. ♬

650
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,630
I will go back.

651
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:20,070
To the place where I was. Before it's too late.

652
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:26,940
♬ I see that again,
like seeing it for the first time ♬

653
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:32,210
Perhaps...  ♬ As if you are someone I
can't see again when tomorrow comes ♬

654
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:36,250
You said to tell you if I have
plans of liking you, right?

655
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,620
♬ Love... ♬

656
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,520
I have... a plan.

657
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,390
♬ makes me impatient ♬

658
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:48,690
So... Don't go.

659
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:55,030
♬ You are someone I want within my reach to
the end  Until the last moment of my life ♬

660
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:04,210
♬ Somewhere sometime I will meet and love you. ♬

661
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:08,650
♬ If I see you like someone
receding in the distance ♬

662
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,880
♬ I am scared ♬

663
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:19,390
♬ Even for the moment when
I am holding your hand ♬

664
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,840
Are you alright?

665
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:54,230
I will be going back to the sea now.

666
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:59,830
I know that it is the way for both of us to live.

667
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:08,240
Just like when we first parted
ways, only I will have the memory,

668
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,010
and you won't.

669
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:16,080
We should have lived like that in our own world.

670
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Now I will not come back again.

671
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,730
So you should forget everything.

672
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,170
Let me ask you one thing.

673
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,740
The first time that we broke up,
why did you erase my memories?

674
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:55,820
If I did not erase them,
I knew you would be in pain all the time.

675
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:03,160
If you didn't erase them, then I could
have longed for you all the time.

676
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,430
This time...

677
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:15,070
Don't erase them. You must not erase them.

678
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:21,280
This memory, this remembrance.

679
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,950
Even if it hurts, it's something
that I will bring to the end.

680
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,420
It belongs to me.

681
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:51,080
♬ Under the same sky with you ♬

682
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,050
♬ Being together with you ♬

683
00:58:55,050 --> 00:59:00,490
♬ I am afraid it will get erased ♬

684
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:06,460
♬ As far as the blue sea's horizon ♬

685
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,560
♬ If I could walk with you  ♬

686
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:15,930
♬ I will not let go of your hand ♬

687
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:21,840
♬ Under the same sky with you♬

688
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,610
♬ Being together with you♬

689
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:31,020
♬ I am afraid it will get erased ♬

690
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:37,190
♬ As far as the blue sea's horizon ♬

691
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,690
♬ If I could walk with you ♬
