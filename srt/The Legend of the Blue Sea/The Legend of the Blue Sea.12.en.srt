1
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,940
Die.

2
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,050
And don't ever be born again.

3
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,850
Stop!

4
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,960
Criminal Kim Dam Ryeong,
accept the royal command.

5
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,160
What did you say?

6
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,230
You have been entranced by a witch

7
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,940
and have not been able to fulfill
your duty as a local government official.

8
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,840
Kim Dam Ryeong,
who has disturbed the public sentiment,

9
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,080
will be under house arrest exile
in Gyeongsang Province, in Geoje.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,150
Come out and receive the command.

11
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,250
Man, I was right, you slippery fellow.

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,010
I feel like I came to catch a tiger
and caught a rabbit,

13
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,260
but having caught one is
having caught one anyway.

14
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,430
Byeong Hwan, request some
backup support to the square.

15
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,840
- I'll go.  - What?

16
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,840
I'll follow along quietly
so don't call more people.

17
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,450
Heo Joon Jae, come quickly.

18
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,840
Heo Joon Jae, where are you?

19
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,250
Legend of the Blue Sea

20
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,650
Let's go, punk.

21
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,650
Episode 12

22
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,060
I'll just answer my phone.

23
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,830
Your phone.

24
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,440
You don't have to release these.
Just hold my phone to my ear for me.

25
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,460
You bastard, you.

26
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,540
You said the same thing three years ago saying
your parents would be worried about you.

27
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,740
Then you called your friends
and rabbitted, you punk!

28
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,850
This time it's really not like that.

29
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,450
My girlfriend is waiting alone.

30
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,550
She'll probably wait and leave if you don't come.

31
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,550
I'm neither a criminal who has been
caught in the act nor someone for

32
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,960
whom you have an arrest warrant.

33
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,260
I've agreed to comply with the investigation
and I'm going with you voluntarily.

34
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,360
You can't put these handcuffs on me, to
begin with, and I can use my cellphone too.

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,710
If you violate this,

36
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,040
you are violating the law on the performance of
duties by police officers and under Article 12

37
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,940
- the punishment is up to one year of
incarceration and labor.  - Yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,740
Okay. I'll live in prison.
Let's live there together.

39
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,350
You'll live there a little longer though.

40
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,750
Aish, Seriously!

41
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,930
Your party can't answer the phone
so you're being connected to voicemail.

42
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,360
And after being connected...

43
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,160
Where did Heo Joon Jae go?

44
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,130
What are you doing here? After sending
out so many men to catch Ma Dae Young?

45
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,640
This is that punk, Heo Joon Jae,
who goes around pretending to be me.

46
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,740
Oh, that con artist!

47
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,950
What did you just say?
Did you just say, 'Ma Dae Young'?

48
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,150
Don't try your tricks.

49
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,950
Ma Dae Young. That bastard is here?

50
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,320
We don't know either. We came after getting
a tip from someone who supposedly saw him.

51
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,960
Let me go.

52
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,630
Let's go. Let's confine him somewhere
for now and come back. It's really noisy.

53
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,130
- Hey, you punk!  - Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?!

54
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,440
Listen well. It is me whom Ma Dae Young is after.

55
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,740
What is he saying?
It's correct that he's a con artist.

56
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,150
Why would that punk be after you?

57
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,050
I don't know either.

58
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,120
If Ma Dae Young is really close to
here, he followed me.

59
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,060
But that woman is alone right now!
Hurry up and give me the phone!

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,730
The person I know best

61
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,140
If you long press #1 my voice will come out.

62
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
The person I know best

63
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,340
Answer.

64
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,240
Please answer.

65
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,550
Heo Joon Jae changed it.

66
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,250
Heo Joon Jae.

67
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,850
Where are you right now?

68
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,150
I'm where I was earlier, where I was waiting.

69
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,960
I had something urgent come up.

70
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,330
I have to go somewhere so
hurry up and go home right now.

71
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
All right.

72
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,830
Can you go? Do you have money?

73
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,140
I have money.

74
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,740
Okay. I'll get into a taxi right now. There's a taxi.

75
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,140
Yeah. Okay.

76
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,150
Don't hang up and get in.

77
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,150
Do you know the house address?

78
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,450
Yeah, I know it.

79
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,350
Ahjussi.

80
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,360
Personal  Best TAXI Driver

81
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,370
What happened? Why are you quiet? Cheong.

82
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,130
Sim Cheong.

83
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,240
Hello?

84
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,140
You wore a hat today also?

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,940
He wore a police hat and a black hat too.

86
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,250
The man that wore the hat is Ma Dae Young, right?

87
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,750
It's Ma Dae Young, right?

88
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,150
Cheong! Cheong!

89
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,060
Tell me what you see around you!
Where are you right now?

90
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
Heo Joon Jae. Where we agreed
to meet when it first snowed.

91
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,360
That's looking bigger and bigger.

92
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,930
The phone got disconnected. Call again.

93
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,840
The cell phone is powered off right now...

94
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,740
She's not answering.

95
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,450
As for our "next time" we meet over there.

96
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,950
- Namsan?  - Yeah. Let's meet there.

97
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,550
Namsan. They're going in the direction of Namsan.

98
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,160
Ma Dae Young is disguised as a
taxi driver and he's driving.

99
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,060
Go towards Namsan also, hurry!

100
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,330
What, should I really go?

101
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,330
Well, go for now.

102
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,840
If this is really a scam, I'm really
going to kill you dead and go to prison.

103
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,740
If something happens to that
woman, I'm going to kill you too.

104
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,450
Hurry up and take these off.

105
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,850
You bastard.

106
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,950
I'm feeling uneasy about what you're doing, punk.

107
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
What are you doing?

108
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Hurry up and call the local patrols near
Namsan and request their cooperation.

109
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,440
Notification  GPS locator
confirmation not possible

110
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,740
Why is the GPS locator not working?

111
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,540
The taxi thought to have Ma Dae Young
driving it is fleeing Namsan bound.

112
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,800
Yongsan, Seodaemun district, and Central,

113
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,850
I'm requesting checkpoints
be set up in the vicinity.

114
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,650
Namsangongwon-gil

115
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,850
Tell them to check among the recently stolen
private taxis passing through that direction.

116
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,860
He's presumed to be driving a stolen taxi
so confirm reported stolen taxi lists.

117
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,160
I expect meticulous confirmation.

118
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,930
You have to tell them that there's
a woman that's been kidnapped.

119
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,330
There's a woman inside.

120
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,440
Early 30's.

121
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,240
Early 30's.

122
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,640
- Long hair.  - Long hair.

123
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
She's really pretty too.

124
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,140
They say she's quite a beauty.

125
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,250
Let's go quickly.

126
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,450
Does he think he's in some taxi?

127
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,760
Checkpoint

128
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,940
Do they say nothing has been
caught in the inspections yet?

129
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,640
Not yet.

130
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,650
In order not to get caught and
escape, there's only one road...

131
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,750
Take the side road toward
the tunnel from Hanoelro.

132
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,350
Take it?

133
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,960
That's the only way out of Seoul
that avoids checkpoint inspections.

134
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,860
Hey, take it. This punk's specialty
is scams, and his co-major is escape.

135
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,660
You can't know the Seoul
city streets better than me.

136
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,870
That's something to be proud of.

137
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,610
Call me.

138
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,780
Call for me.

139
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,180
I will hear.

140
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,160
I will hear and come.

141
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,700
Love Hospital

142
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,070
What are you doing?

143
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,050
Don't try to get up. You won't be able to move anyway.

144
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,790
I have no intention to do anything to you.

145
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,720
My personality is such that I can't stand being
curious so I'm trying to confirm something.

146
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,620
What are you confirming?

147
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,550
I keep dreaming these
strange dreams frequently.

148
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,430
At first, I thought they
were just useless dreams,

149
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,760
but I keep getting the feeling
that they could be true.

150
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,170
Why are you confirming your dreams with me?

151
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,040
Because they have to do with you.

152
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,140
Dreams about me?

153
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,040
It's not precise, but inside the dream

154
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,150
It's really a mermaid.

155
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,850
it seemed like you were a mermaid.

156
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:25,120
When you were inside the water a mermaid, and
when you were on land you appeared to be human.

157
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,160
And the tears that mermaid shed became pearls.

158
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,940
It's not like we are in the show,
"Legend of the Hometown."

159
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,830
At first, I didn't think it made sense, either.

160
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,500
But I kept getting a strange thought.

161
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,380
Well, if I threw you

162
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,750
into that water.

163
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,520
It would confirm it.

164
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,390
They say that there isn't a car that's
been caught in the inspections yet.

165
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,390
Until when do we have to keep going?

166
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,060
Detective Jang. Isn't this the way to that
hospital in Ma Dae Young's treatment records?

167
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,840
Yes, that's right.

168
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,840
But that hospital was closed
down the year before last.

169
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,440
That's true. That's why we struggled so much
in finding those hospital treatment records.

170
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,780
- Go to the hospital.  - We're going there right now.

171
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,950
Don't keep ordering us around.

172
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,820
Hurry up and go.

173
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,570
Hey, Heo Joon Jae!

174
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,150
Operating Room Restricted Area

175
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,160
Cheong. Cheong.

176
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,870
I don't know what kind of dream it was

177
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,820
but if I was a mermaid in it,
did I give you a warning of some sort?

178
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,650
A mermaid doesn't leave alone a
human who has touched her body.

179
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,690
A mermaid can erase whatever
memories she wishes.

180
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,630
Be careful Sir.
If you mistakenly touch a mermaid

181
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,330
they say the mermaid will take
your soul and erase your memories.

182
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:53,710
I heard this is the way that the mermaids
have to protect themselves from humans.

183
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,180
Whatever you want to decide is the price.

184
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,410
Would it even compare to a hundred
roots of wild mountain ginseng?

185
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,180
I heard that the quality of oil
that's collected from a mermaid

186
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,350
is unbelievable.

187
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,420
I will definitely make that mermaid mine again.

188
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,030
I'm going to kill that immature
official fellow by own hand.

189
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,800
Until she dies I'm going beat the
tears out of her, drop by drop.

190
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,070
I'm thinking to spread the pearls on the path you

191
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,640
walk upon. A foolish love

192
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,010
- makes me so happy.  - Die,

193
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,650
and never be born again.

194
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,790
Among the fishermen, there was
one who put his hands on a mermaid

195
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,090
and I heard he went insane.

196
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,190
The moment you put your hands on me

197
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,760
you will lose all of your memories.

198
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,200
That is the way in which a mermaid
can protect herself from humans.

199
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,150
Confirm it.

200
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,020
Heo Joon Hae. I'm scared.

201
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,600
I'm sorry

202
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,540
that I came so late.

203
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,740
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,690
Aish! Ma Dae Young, you bastard. Where did you go?

205
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,700
Requesting backup support.

206
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,000
Joon Jae, did you see the news?

207
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,020
There's a huge commotion
going on right now in Seoul

208
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,510
with searches and inspection
checkpoints to catch Ma Dae Young.

209
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,710
Hey, and you know who the detective
in charge of Ma Dae Young is?

210
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,180
Don't be shocked, okay? That Mi Mi Hong Dong Pyo.

211
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,490
I think I'm that Mi Mi Hong Dong Pyo.

212
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,020
What does the Mi Mi stand for?

213
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,030
Michin Misery (crazy miserable).

214
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,660
I'll be right back.

215
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,600
Have a seat since you're here.

216
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,820
Wow.

217
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,160
I... From before, if I ever met you

218
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,290
I always wanted to tell you.

219
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:14,570
When I die, I think I'll donate
everything I have to society.

220
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,900
Are you going to take us in?

221
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,510
Heo Joon Jae. That person earlier...

222
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,320
Let's talk about it later.
You had a hard time today.

223
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,220
Don't think about that and don't worry.

224
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,760
Today sleep here deeply.
I'll sleep up in the attic room.

225
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,330
They say you suffer when you leave home.
It's so nice to come home.

226
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,800
That's right.

227
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,870
So don't go out so recklessly
and just keep staying here.

228
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,010
- Forever?  - You can't forever.

229
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,250
Why?

230
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,390
This is a long term deposit
lease ending in two years.

231
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,220
There's a lot left, though, about a year and a half.

232
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,490
Long-term deposit lease?

233
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:19,300
In truth, I'm saying this house isn't mine.

234
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,540
What's mine is only this furniture and baggage.

235
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,700
Later we have to move all of it.

236
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,970
- Move all of it?  - Yeah.

237
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,740
- Who?  - You have to move all of it.

238
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,880
Since you're going to go with me.

239
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,310
Together?

240
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,930
Go on and sleep. I have some more things
to discuss with the person out there.

241
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,040
To be frank, I should ask the woman
inside over there a few things.

242
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,810
You can't because she's really in shock.

243
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,880
And with regards to Ma Dae Young,
I know more than her so ask me instead.

244
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,490
If Ma Dae Young attempted to take
that woman, there should be a reason.

245
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,890
I told you. It's me.

246
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,560
Tae Oh, show them Mae Dae
Young's security cam footage.

247
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,000
Look, isn't it from that day
that that loan shark died?

248
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,110
It is. I was right.

249
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,350
He came to that house wearing that.
And not long ago...

250
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,780
Joon Jae. Shortly after 7 p.m. at 29-21 Banji in
Yeonjoong-dong, I'll see you. I'll be waiting.

251
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,790
What's this?

252
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,990
It's an ajusshi that I'm close with, but
after his DUI incident he's been in a coma.

253
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,460
Then I received such a text message.

254
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,060
Joon Jae went out because of
that text and almost died.

255
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,600
It was disguised as an accident and it probably
means Ma Dae Young is somehow involved.

256
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,270
Have you ever scammed Ma Dae Young
himself or his acquaintances?

257
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,310
No.

258
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,240
Let's not be so confident. You never know.

259
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,020
Anyway, Ma Dae Young is one thing and you all are--

260
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,850
But then, it won't be easy to put us in for fraud.

261
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,490
None of the victims have
ever reported anything.

262
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,390
They probably can't because it's
all money that wasn't clean anyway.

263
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,430
Is it not a crime if they can't report it?

264
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,930
And you, you always go
somewhere pretending to be me.

265
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,240
It isn't like I pretended to be
a police detective and embezzled.

266
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,810
I never injured anyone.

267
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,480
As for impersonating a public servant,
don't I only need to pay a fine?

268
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
This thing, really.
If at least he couldn't be so eloquent.

269
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:52,280
Let's first catch that crazy
bastard Ma Dae Young. I'll help.

270
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,950
Do we catch him because you told us to?

271
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,520
I was planning on catching
him from the beginning.

272
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,960
Let's talk about the problem we have
between us after catching Ma Dae Young.

273
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,030
After that, I'll do as you ask, Detective.

274
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,370
- How do I trust you?  - I even let you know where I live.

275
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:15,240
Now that I have a lot to lose, I can't go
running away anywhere I please anymore.

276
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,610
Even if it's hard to believe me, just do so.
Could you please just leave for the day?

277
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,520
We have to move everything later.

278
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,030
Move all of these? Who will?

279
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,060
You need to move all of them
since you'll be going with me.

280
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,510
What does it mean to move a
"yearly deposit home" together?

281
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,480
Does that mean let's get married? No that's not it.

282
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,450
It didn't seem like he was
saying let's get married.

283
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,650
He told me that I have to move all the stuff.

284
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,720
Did he perhaps need me so I
could move all the furniture?

285
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,760
Do you think that's what that meant?

286
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,360
Idiot.

287
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,860
Does he mean he'll marry someone else and
expects me to just move the furniture?

288
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,570
No, I don't mean that. That's not it.

289
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,940
- But then...  - But then?

290
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,740
"But then" what? What then?

291
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,740
Why did he touch my hair?

292
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,310
He definitely lovingly fluffed it.

293
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,950
So cute.

294
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:37,560
Heo Joon Jae, maybe it's not that he only plans
to like me but does he already like (me)--

295
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,030
Has he fallen deeply for?

296
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,430
Is this the start of romantic love?

297
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,300
Oh! What do I do?! What do I do?!

298
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,900
No. For him to like me, he bickers too much.

299
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,210
Then, why did he touch my hair earlier?
He touched it because he liked it.

300
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,110
His pj's are green, too. Oh, Heo Joon Jae! Did
he even turn his whole body green for me?

301
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,050
A green light for me to come! Is that how it is?

302
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,350
Hey! Let's go to sleep! Please!

303
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,020
What, Heo Joon Jae?

304
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,760
- You're not asleep yet?  - Yeah, I'll go to sleep.

305
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,900
Why don't you hurry off to
sleep since you're tired?

306
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,870
Don't do things like thinking too much.
You have to sleep deeply.

307
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,010
That way you can wake up early and watch
the morning drama you love so much.

308
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,880
Okay. Good night.

309
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,810
Okay, good night.

310
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,220
Don't think, okay? Go to sleep.

311
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,600
His tone was slightly angry. Why is he mad?

312
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,010
- Please don't. Stop. Please!  - No that's not
it. He said, "good night" and smiled at me.

313
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,280
What's the significance of his smile?

314
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,210
He worried about me. Does he perhaps like me?

315
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,220
No, that's not it. He told me to move all the stuff.

316
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,190
Does...does that mean let's get married?

317
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,720
It was a slightly annoyed voice.
That's so strange.

318
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,940
Goo Baek's Dad is not picking up.
He's not answering again.

319
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,470
I think things will still
take some time on this side

320
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,740
because they're on a different level.

321
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,710
- Did we try for naught?  - Honey!

322
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,980
Just like there is no black (illegal) money,
there is no such thing as useless effort.

323
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,520
If we put in effort,
it's bound to yield rewards for us.

324
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,420
- Does it?  - Let's think.

325
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,500
That's right! We should once again
try, on Chairman Heo's front. Right?

326
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,800
Hello, Madam, you've been doing well, right?

327
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,680
Yes. Oh, Madam,
we need to have an end-of-the-year party.

328
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,250
Shall we then?

329
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,620
Yeah, around 7. I'll see you there. Okay.

330
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,670
Did the two of you not sleep well?
Your faces look so haggard.

331
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,470
Yeah, because I had a lot to think about.

332
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,110
Yeah, because she had stuff to think about.

333
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,710
What?

334
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:22,280
Because she was moving
around, I couldn't sleep well.

335
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,520
- I moved around? - Yeah. A lot.

336
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,120
Did he get angry at me just now? Why is that?

337
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,990
Did he start to dislike me
in the span of one night?

338
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:35,130
What did I do? He told me, "Let's move a 'yearly-loan
house' together," and was even green. Why's he mad?

339
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,130
No! It's not!

340
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,640
It's that now that I think about it.

341
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,140
It didn't seem like you were being
particularly noisy when you moved around.

342
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,840
Let's eat.

343
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,940
Hyung, shall we go out today and buy a tree?

344
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,510
- A Christmas tree?  - I want to go! I want to go too.

345
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,910
No, you stay home.

346
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,880
I will go with Hyung Nam Doo and Tae Oh.
The three of us will go,

347
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,950
so you stay home. By yourself.

348
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,180
You want me to be by myself?

349
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,390
Stay home alone.

350
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm telling you to go inside the water you like.

351
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,260
Why is he saying I should stay home alone?

352
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,130
Is it that he's telling me
to be in torment by myself?

353
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,900
Why? Just why?

354
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,970
No. That's not it.

355
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,700
As you live with three guys,

356
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,600
there might be things you can't do.

357
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,840
That's true.

358
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,340
Yeah. So do those.

359
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,310
For us, 7 o'clock.
We won't be back at the house before 7,

360
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:05,580
so until then, you stay in this house alone.

361
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,850
So do the things you want. Do that.

362
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,990
Think you're the house owner.

363
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,330
Is he telling me to clean? That I should think
I'm the house owner and clean really well?

364
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,430
No cleaning chores, not those kinds of things!

365
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,970
The things you can do to relax most comfortably.

366
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,500
Do those kinds of things!

367
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,440
- What are you doing? - Hey, that looks like it
hurts. Why are you pinching her cheeks like that?

368
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,810
Weirdly, I want to.

369
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,890
Why is my face so hot?
Is it hot because he pinched it?

370
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,120
No? It's hot even without pinching.

371
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,560
What's with me?

372
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,860
Then let's buy a tree,

373
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,800
some wine, some things to eat,
and have a simple Christmas party.

374
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,270
- Invite Si Ah too.  - Sure.

375
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,940
Okay. Then I'll come out after I get ready.
Let's head out after ten minutes.

376
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,880
This hurts a lot.
But for some weird reason, I like it.

377
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,280
What is this feeling? Am I going crazy?

378
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:18,690
I can't be the only one feeling something good
like this. I want Heo Joon Jae to feel this too.

379
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

380
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,610
When you're alone,

381
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,410
do what you want. For sure.

382
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,080
What's this now?

383
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,480
I couldn't think of anything for a short while.

384
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,750
What does this mean? What's the meaning of this?

385
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,420
What does he think about me?
What is it? Does he like me or what?

386
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,490
What happened? What's the meaning of this?
What happened?

387
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,400
Two of the friends said
they would be the witnesses.

388
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,330
That neither has a conflict of interest in
the matter of being entrusted with the task

389
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,570
has been confirmed through the
paperwork you have sent in advance.

390
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,140
But, Sir,

391
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,440
what is the reason for rushing
the making of your formal will.

392
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,180
About my son Joon Jae.

393
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,820
I want to give him all of my fortune.

394
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,820
Whether it's stocks, real estate,
international assets, whatever it is.

395
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,200
You're saying everything?

396
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,230
Everything that I can within limits.

397
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,870
But, Sir, your current wife

398
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,340
and Heo Chi Hoon need to receive at least
the legally reserved amount of inheritance.

399
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,540
That way, there won't be an
inheritance lawsuit problem later.

400
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,210
If I exclude those,

401
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,280
how much inheritance will
Joon Jae possibly receive?

402
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,590
He can receive at most 9/14.

403
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,820
You must be busy during the
year-end holiday season.

404
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,960
I am so grateful for your giving up this time.

405
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,230
No, I'll pay today.

406
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,730
We only ever ate good things from you guys.

407
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,100
No, no. I'll pay.

408
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,040
Would you like some Chinese wine (白干兒)?

409
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,680
Sounds good.

410
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,480
Please take some.

411
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,580
For me, too.

412
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,650
Madam, let's do a toast.

413
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,590
For your family and my family's friendship,

414
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,260
as well as for our business alliance.

415
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,360
Cheers!

416
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,130
I'll one-shot it.

417
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,410
Have some. You know,

418
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,820
my husband is not brave enough

419
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,720
to bring this up, even though he's been wanting to...

420
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,190
About our co-investment or stock sharing—

421
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,860
Oh, wait.

422
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,330
Hello, Attorney Lee. Yes, of course.

423
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,300
Yes, yes. Then please keep up the good work.

424
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,600
Unni.

425
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,110
Unni?

426
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,810
You're a lot older than I am.

427
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,510
You're old! So you're an unni.

428
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,480
Here, Unni. Let's drink a glass.

429
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,090
Jin Joo, you're very drunk.

430
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,060
I'm very drunk, but, to be honest,

431
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,460
I'm very upset with you.

432
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,930
Soy sauce seasoned crab, monkfish stew,

433
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,470
kimchi, and fermented salty side dishes...
With all the things I've sent you,

434
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,210
if you put all those together, you could open
up a nice full course Korean restaurant!

435
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,510
You received all those and now you ignore me?

436
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,640
Do you just "eat and run"?!

437
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,220
If you take it every day, you should
know how to give sometimes, seriously!

438
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,720
Why are you playing hard to get? Huh?

439
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,620
Am I dating now? Huh?!

440
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,830
Secretary Kim, get the car ready.

441
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,900
Let's leave.

442
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,130
Shut up!

443
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,330
Listen carefully.

444
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,000
Listen to me, okay?

445
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,710
Are you going to include us or not?

446
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,440
Sober up and take your time leaving.

447
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:40,350
Since she is so mean like this, she seduced
her high school classmate's husband. Geesh!

448
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,060
What? What did you just say?

449
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:54,000
I read everything in Gangnam Tabloid!

450
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,840
You stole your high school friend's husband.

451
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,740
That friend went missing,
and their son got thrown out.

452
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:07,610
It says you've completely ruined that family.

453
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,380
Wow, seriously!

454
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,520
You really are something else, eh?!

455
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,120
Amazing.

456
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,000
Wait, what's going on?
Why isn't our Cheong coming out?

457
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:38,610
Are these clothes better? No.
Heo Joon Jae doesn't like short things.

458
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,880
This is long. No, no. This is too hot.

459
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,050
You shouldn't be hot.

460
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,260
Is this appropriate?

461
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,560
I need to look prettier than Cha Si Ah.

462
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,970
Wow, today you're Party Cheong, Party Cheong.

463
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,070
Wow, pretty!

464
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,280
Come over here.

465
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,820
I told you not to take a picture, didn't I?

466
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,850
This rascal. I told you! Come over here.

467
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,960
Come over here!

468
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,760
Stop drinking, Dog Nam Doo.

469
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,590
Merry Christmas.

470
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,670
I want to try too.

471
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,140
You do?

472
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,640
Wow, there's nothing Cheong can't do.

473
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,950
I want to do it again.

474
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,650
You're good.

475
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:03,060
I can't really do it, Joon Jae. You hold this and...?

476
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,470
You just put this here and you hit right here.

477
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,400
Why am I uselessly doing this well?

478
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,880
Because I'm already doing this
well, Heo Joon Jae can't teach me.

479
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,540
Why am I so good at this?

480
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,720
Even if I try to stop, I can't. The snack is too good.

481
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,790
Hey, don't laugh and teach me correctly.

482
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,330
Is it good?

483
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,840
You came again?

484
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,270
Yeah, Cha Si Ah.

485
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:52,140
This is my house, so I go outside and come back.

486
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,750
Of course, I'll have to move with him when Heo
Joon Jae moves his lease after a year and a half.

487
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,220
What? Are you marrying Heo Joon Jae?

488
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,520
Although he hasn't said that is was definite,

489
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,990
he did say there was a plan like that between us.

490
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,160
Plan? What plan?

491
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,400
The plan for Heo Joon Jae to like me.

492
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,870
- Joon Jae said that?  - Yeah.

493
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,840
It looks like Joon Jae did it again.
He usually says something like that.

494
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,010
- What? - You're always saying this inside, right?

495
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,420
"Oh? Does he like me?
His gaze is a gaze that he likes me."

496
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,750
"Is it not? Is he only treating me well?"

497
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,590
"But what does he mean by him
having a plan to like her?"

498
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,560
"Does he like me?"

499
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,830
"But why hasn't he said to date him?
Does he not like me?"

500
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,530
Can you hear something from inside?

501
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,830
It's not that I can hear anything.

502
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,600
This is called "managing the aquarium."
(Managing several potential suitors)

503
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,900
Managing the aquarium?

504
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,470
They throw out the bait and
then keep them inside the net,

505
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,170
and then have them maintain high expectation.

506
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,040
You can't handle Joon Jae.

507
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,480
I am capable of not being swept
by it and can stay by Joon Jae.

508
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,390
That's exactly what you are.
A fish captured inside an aquarium.

509
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,650
I'm not a fish.

510
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,320
No. You're a fish.

511
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,360
It's enough that you were here for this long.
Now go back to where you lived before,

512
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,730
whether it's a river or an ocean.

513
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,320
Pick up.

514
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,760
The person cannot be reached—

515
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,460
Mother.

516
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,830
Oh. Chi Hyeon.

517
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,440
Why? Do you have something to say?

518
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,840
Who's my father?

519
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,380
Your father is sleeping
in the master bedroom now.

520
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,410
My biological father.

521
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,890
Why? Did you suddenly become curious?

522
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:20,390
I was always curious but just couldn't ask you.

523
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,930
Hey Chi Hyeon,

524
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:32,600
your real father is loving you in his own way.

525
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:39,910
He knows well that not appearing in
front of you, and you not knowing him are

526
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,850
the things that would make you happy,
hence he isn't making an appearance.

527
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:51,020
So you don't have to know that. Okay?

528
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,960
What you have to know is the fact that the
only people worth trusting in this world

529
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,900
are you and me, only the two of us. Hmm?

530
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,840
Yes, Mother.

531
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,170
It seems to be true.

532
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,950
It really seems to be true.

533
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,490
Is that you? Come and have a seat.

534
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,430
Why, Noona?

535
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,330
Come have a drink.

536
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,620
What's this for?

537
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,450
Silly kid. If you wanted to have a
picture of me, all you had to do was ask.

538
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:00,190
Why would you take a picture
secretly in such a crowded place?

539
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,030
Noona, that earlier isn't
what you're thinking, but—

540
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,330
Don't bother explaining.
It makes you appear unseemly.

541
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,800
I told you. I can't accept your feelings,

542
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,070
but I don't look down on your love.

543
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,250
Don't do things in hiding, but
instead, fess up to me your pain.

544
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,050
I'm not in pain. I'm saying this
because I'm really not hurting.

545
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:33,530
Listen well, Tae Ho. It's been seven years for me.

546
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,940
From the first day of my college
entrance when I saw Joon Jae,

547
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,160
and from then for the seven following years,

548
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,030
I've been watching from afar and
maintained this type of relationship

549
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,340
continuously. Why do you suppose that is?

550
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,540
You're curious, right?

551
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,240
It's because I didn't let on.

552
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,080
Without burdening the object of your
interest to remain neat and clean.

553
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,490
While maintaining the appropriate distance.

554
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,900
Don't you think the mature person's
love would be something like that? Hmm?

555
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,970
Joon Jae, don't hang up.

556
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:25,040
Are you guys the only people with a plan?

557
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,820
For me, I won't do the engagement
party with you Joon Jae,

558
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,020
but go straight to getting married.

559
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,290
You know that's trendy these days.
A small wedding.

560
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,360
I'm going to do exactly that.

561
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:45,660
Either on the Jeju island Oileh trail or
a buckwheat field in Gangwon Province...

562
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,510
I will put up an iron cauldron,
and boil noodle soup.

563
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,510
(Inviting people to come eat noodle
soup means inviting them to the wedding)

564
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,980
When we deliver a baby, I won't do the 100th day
or 1-year birthday ceremonies,

565
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,250
but give a charitable donation to UNICEF.

566
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:07,590
That's right now... That's now very much... trendy.

567
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:16,060
Joon Jae! Joon Jae, don't hang up.

568
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,970
By the way,

569
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,940
what is it that I've done so far, huh?

570
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:28,510
Have I been making porridge to serve
the dog? (wasted time and energy)

571
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,980
Is that what I've been doing?

572
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,720
Joon Jae! Joon Jae!!

573
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,220
If you get so loud in the middle of
the street, the police will be called.

574
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,360
Quickly go home.

575
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,630
Who are you with? Tae Oh?

576
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,360
Joon Jae!

577
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,470
Ask Tae Oh to take you home.
I'm really going to hang up now.

578
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,640
The end of the year did come I guess, seeing
how Cha Si Ah is placing a drunk call.

579
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,080
She seems to hold it in well until the
end of the year when she does that once.

580
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,090
Why are you here in that posture?

581
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,390
Get on up to your room now.

582
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,700
What's the matter?

583
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,670
Heo Joon Jae, are you seeing me as a fish?

584
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,470
Are you regulating your fish-farm?
(managing many potential suitors)

585
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,510
Aren't you going to go up?

586
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,920
What is this attitude?

587
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,650
Is he implying that since he can't stand
the sight of me that I should go up?

588
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,820
Does he mean for me to get lost?

589
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,620
No, no, no, no. Never mind.

590
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,200
I'll go up. You sleep here today too.

591
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,500
And,

592
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,410
don't think anything at
all tonight and sleep well.

593
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,410
I beg you.

594
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,380
My heart gave a thump again.

595
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,920
Would it ever be possible
to escape this fish-farm?

596
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,900
So much for sleeping...

597
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:46,510
I just want to go to sleep, seriously.
How many days has this been?

598
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,260
Are you okay?

599
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,330
After meeting up with the wife of Chairman Heo,
what...? Did you go to the 4th round or something?

600
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,600
You were totally wasted.

601
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,440
What? Did you speak of something deep?

602
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,310
Are you going to eat and run?

603
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,610
Shut up!...broken the home into pieces...

604
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:25,420
You are a bad bitch, seriously!

605
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:30,190
This probably is a dream, right?

606
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,660
Please tell me it's a dream, huh?

607
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,730
Come on, seriously. Tell me it's a dream! A dream!

608
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,470
What's gotten into you?

609
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:51,310
Today 11:32 pm; Today 11:29 pm; Today 11:28 pm...

610
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:02,020
Oh, Missus. I think I need to run to the hospital
to pick up some blood pressure medicine.

611
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,160
Go on. Go on ahead.

612
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:17,800
What brings you here, Ms. Jin Joo?

613
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,540
Secretary Kim told me that you were here, and so...

614
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,110
Madam. Please just kill me.

615
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,780
- You're asking me to kill you? - Yes, please.

616
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,350
My drinking habit is usually
pretty neat, you know?

617
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,290
But why do you suppose I did that yesterday?

618
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:43,230
Come on. Why not tell the
Gangnam gossip in detail?

619
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:48,000
Go-go-ssip? Oh my gosh, Madam.
I don't read things like gossip!

620
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,540
Madam. Whatever I may have said yesterday

621
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,270
that isn't me. That isn't An Jin Joo.

622
00:49:55,270 --> 00:50:00,180
Just please consider some beast
living within me wailed...

623
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,820
Can't you just consider it that?

624
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,980
Oh god, Madam.

625
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,760
Has your face always been that red?

626
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,700
You seem to be red every time I see you.

627
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,600
Can you teach me that?

628
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,400
What?

629
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,670
Computer. There's a limit
to learning it through TV.

630
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,440
They say that you can find out all
sorts of things using computers.

631
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,750
Then can you know that, too?

632
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,380
What?

633
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:42,090
- If someone's on the hook.  - Hey!
What are you guys doing up there?

634
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,690
How not to be on the hook or how to find out
if someone's just flirting with you.

635
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,660
That kind of stuff.

636
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,330
Get off each other!

637
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:54,330
Don't whisper in ears, just think instead.

638
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:58,370
Hey, Tae Oh. Why are your ears getting red?

639
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,210
Don't get them red. What are you guys doing?

640
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,140
Tae Oh's going to teach me computer.

641
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,810
- I will teach you.  - No!

642
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,280
I have to find out if you like
me or are just flirting with me.

643
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,590
Hey, do I have to say it out loud for you know?

644
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,250
What?

645
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,260
What did you just say?

646
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:27,370
I-I mean do you have to say it
out loud to teach you computer.

647
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:33,410
Can't you just learn by looking
from the side like this a few times?

648
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:38,680
Fine. If you want to learn it from Tae
Oh, learn it from him.

649
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,350
I will show you how to search online, first.

650
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:42,910
Okay.

651
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:47,850
That's weird. You've been taking
your medication diligently.

652
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,490
Why did it get worse?

653
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:57,260
I'm dizzier and it's still blurry.
I can't even see your face well.

654
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:03,500
We can't just leave it like this. In
the worst case, you can lose your sight.

655
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,840
Doctor, what do we do, then? We have to do
everything we can now before it's too late.

656
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:14,850
At least it's the outside hardware
that's hurt, so we can do a surgery.

657
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:21,050
If it was the inside retina that was damaged
and progressed to a macular degeneration,

658
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:25,520
we probably wouldn't have any other way.

659
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,960
Right.

660
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,760
I guess we have to schedule
a date for surgery, then.

661
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,730
Yeah, we should. Surgery is one thing,
but you need to be careful afterward, too.

662
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:41,910
Did you really not get poked or hurt your eye?

663
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,010
No.

664
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,590
Sit here. I'll go check out.

665
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,250
Okay.

666
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,330
Honey, I'm done. Let's go.

667
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,960
Yeah.

668
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:46,040
Honey, shall we go have lunch with Chi Hyeon?

669
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,880
- Sure.  - What do you want?

670
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,180
- Whatever.  - Whatever?

671
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:09,660
I'm sorry. We weren't that close when
we were at school, yet I barged in.

672
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,900
It's okay, Ji Hyeon.

673
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,230
I changed my name. I had reasons.

674
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,700
- My name is Kang Seo Hee.  - Oh, really?

675
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:23,380
Anyway, welcome. My husband's work is going well,

676
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,080
so we have plenty money.

677
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:33,920
It's not easy raising a kid by myself
after my husband suddenly died like that.

678
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,890
I was going to get an insurance policy anyway.

679
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:40,860
I will get one and I'll tell
my husband to get one, too.

680
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,560
I'll let him know, so go visit him at work sometime.

681
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,270
- Thank you so much.  - No problem.

682
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,080
[Breaking News; Fugitive Ma Dae Young
attempts abduction of a woman in 30s.

683
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,350
Increased uneasiness of citizenry.

684
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,690
Heo Chi Hyeon

685
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:19,770
- What?  - Wow, it's the real son.

686
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,600
It's me. The fake son.

687
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,410
Do you perhaps think you got close to me?

688
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,850
No way. How can a fake

689
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:39,850
get close to the real one?

690
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:42,920
- Are you drunk?   - Joon Jae.

691
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,290
I don't think

692
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:49,290
I'll be able to protect your father.

693
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,130
Protect your own father.

694
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,700
I will protect my mother.

695
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,140
What are you doing?

696
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,880
It's my last warning

697
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,980
and a gift

698
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,250
- from the fake to the real.  - What?

699
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,970
Are you just going to take this room now?

700
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,310
I waited to ask you something.

701
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,010
What?

702
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,850
You know...

703
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:52,760
Why did you tell me that you are planning
to like me? Why did you come to save me?

704
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,400
Why did you hug me?
Why did you touch my hair? Do you like me?

705
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,960
Or just like Cha Si Ah said,
are you just flirting with me?

706
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,140
There are all kinds of things on the internet,
but even though I searched all day,

707
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,440
it doesn't have anything about your heart.

708
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,110
I don't know. Do you like me? Or not?

709
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,080
Nothing.

710
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,110
Why don't you ask what you were going to ask?

711
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,550
No. It's not sorted out yet.

712
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:22,550
You're not the kind who sorts it out.
You're the kind who just blurts it out.

713
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:28,230
No. I want to sort it out before I say it.
I'll think it over tonight.

714
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:32,630
You will think it over a lot tonight?

715
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:36,700
Yeah. I'll think about it all night.

716
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,810
And I'll talk to you tomorrow
after I sort everything out.

717
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,950
Wait.

718
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:57,720
How much thinking are you planning to do?

719
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,290
Just all night.

720
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:06,830
All night? I don't know what kind
of thoughts you have in your head.

721
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:13,840
I don't know, but whatever that is, can you not do it?

722
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,140
What is this, now? Is he saying to not think of him?

723
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:23,180
What is that look? Is he mad at me? Why?

724
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,590
Now it's nice and quiet.

725
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,830
From now on, don't think about anything,

726
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:40,430
and don't do anything.
