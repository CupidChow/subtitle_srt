1
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,110
I'll go back.

2
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:41,420
Back to where I originally came from.
Before it's too late.

3
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,630
If perhaps... If I start planning on
liking you, you told me to tell you, right?

4
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,540
It's been formed. A plan.

5
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,970
So... Don't go.

6
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,420
Don't go?

7
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,860
Yes.

8
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,830
Don't go.

9
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,500
Now enough. Let's go home.

10
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,570
Heo Joon Jae, what's the matter? Are you okay?

11
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,840
Heo Joon Jae? Heo Joon Jae!

12
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,220
Heo Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!

13
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,650
Heo Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!

14
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,460
Heo Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!

15
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,030
Heo Joon Jae!

16
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,130
Please help!

17
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,000
Has something happened? What's going on?

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,230
Heo Joon Jae!

19
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,370
What's the matter?

20
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,400
Hello? Someone has collapsed here.

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,640
- Heo Joon Jae! - Please send a medic.

22
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,110
Please send someone quickly!

23
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,610
- Hello? - What should we do?

24
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,050
- Who are you?  - Who are you?

25
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,290
I am Dam Ryeong.

26
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,060
If you are me in the next life,

27
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,660
just remember these words again
after waking from this dream.

28
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,700
Everything repeats itself.

29
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,870
The fate in this world is
continuing in that world.

30
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,440
It's the same way with ill-fate.

31
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,340
Protect that woman

32
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,380
against the dangerous person.

33
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,690
- Heo Joon Jae. - Excuse me, are you okay?

34
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,290
Can you see this? Can you see this?

35
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,190
Heo Joon Jae!

36
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,830
Are you okay?

37
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,860
I am okay.

38
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,230
I am okay.

39
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,100
Are you okay?

40
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,800
I'm okay.

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,270
The Legend of the Blue Sea

42
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,600
Episode 9

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,840
Are you okay now?

44
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,680
You. You also said you were in pain earlier.

45
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,210
I'm not in pain anymore.

46
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,050
Why?

47
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,830
While you were saying you love me or not, whether
I have plans to or not, and bothering me so much,

48
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,730
were you thinking of running away from behind?

49
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,230
Hey, you are scary.

50
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,670
If you go, where? Who would you go to?

51
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,870
That government employee?

52
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,610
Jeong Hoon is gone now.

53
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,480
Why? Where has he gone?

54
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,990
Far.

55
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,190
Did you also plan to go after him far away?

56
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,160
Why? Did he ask you to go far
away and eat ramyun with him?

57
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,600
It wasn't Jeong Hoon who cooked me ramyun.

58
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,300
Do you mean... he isn't that guy?

59
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,500
Then who is that guy?

60
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,040
I can't tell you that.

61
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,250
This won't do. You follow me.

62
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,850
- Look here. See,
there are lots of dolls, right?  -Yeah.

63
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,560
Pick one.

64
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,390
I choose that pink octopus.

65
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,060
Okay, you chose the pink octopus, right?

66
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,500
That's what you chose, so you have
to pick out that one no matter what.

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,970
Here, try it.

68
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,210
I did it!

69
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,380
I almost did it, though.

70
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,020
You're right, it almost came out, right? But it
didn't actually come all the way out, you know.

71
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,120
Life is naturally all about something that
is about to work out but then it may not.

72
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,830
But if you give up here,

73
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,130
then that pink octopus that you
chose will never be able to come out.

74
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,700
Try it again.

75
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,920
I guess it's not working.

76
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,120
You're trying to give up like that again?

77
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,060
If you decided on it,
you can't give up until it becomes yours.

78
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,690
Whether that's the pink octopus,

79
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,830
or anything.

80
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,270
Then I'll try again one more time.

81
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,390
- Hey, now—  - Wait, stay there.

82
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,160
Ah, it almost did it.

83
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,300
From what I see,
there's something wrong with the machine.

84
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,010
It looks like they loosened the
claw on purpose. Let's just go.

85
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,970
Then give up?

86
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,080
No. This isn't giving up, this is stopping for a bit.

87
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,350
Until next time?

88
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,890
Of course. How are you so smart now?
It's been a while...

89
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,990
Anyway, the important thing is that you
should never give up on what you've chosen.

90
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,290
Should you give up, or shouldn't you?

91
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,800
Shouldn't.

92
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
That's right.

93
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,370
Would you like to go and eat
Hobbang (steamed bun with filling)?

94
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Hey, I told you not to go, but you didn't listen to me.

95
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,320
Something serious almost happened!

96
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,650
I said I'm okay.

97
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,620
Who on earth was it? Did you see his face?

98
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,590
I'm not sure.

99
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,930
Anyone that comes to mind?

100
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,400
Well, since we have so many enemies,

101
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,700
I can't narrow it down quickly.

102
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,230
He was spotted by the police
patrolling Hoehyeon-dong,

103
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,600
- What is it?  - and the
chase began in broad daylight.

104
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,740
What?

105
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,810
- It's that person.  - Police failed to
apprehend right in front of their eyes...

106
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,610
It's that person?

107
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,550
The escaped prisoner? Ma Dae Young?

108
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,480
Yes, that's right. It's him.

109
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,420
He took his hat off today.

110
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,120
Cheong, do you remember him, too?

111
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
It's that person, right?

112
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
The one who was wearing the police uniform
and cap when it was raining before.

113
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,000
He wore a police cap and also a black cap.

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,900
You... Have you seen him after that day?

115
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,840
Yes, when I was passing out the flyers.

116
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,810
Whoa! I am so shocked so many times.
Do you see the goosebumps?

117
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,110
Then, the escapee was tailing our Cheong? Why?

118
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,720
If something like that happened,
you should have told me!

119
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,920
Are you a fool?

120
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,130
Cheong wouldn't have known, either. You just
found out, too. Why are you blaming her?

121
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,400
Ah, that punk.
He is just acting up for no good reason.

122
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,250
Ah, it's cold. What are you doing there? Come on in.

123
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,620
Have a seat.

124
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,490
Why the heck would that jerk be tailing Cheong?

125
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,030
Did he just follow Cheong?
He called you out and almost killed you.

126
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,200
Something serious really
could have happened to you!

127
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,430
So, that's what I'm saying.
Why would that jerk follow Cheong...

128
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,940
The fate in this world is
continuing in that world.

129
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,640
It's the same way with ill-fate.

130
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,110
Protect that woman against
the dangerous person.

131
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,050
Hyung.

132
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,650
What?

133
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,160
Don't take it the wrong way.

134
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,760
- I had a dream.  - A dream?

135
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,660
In that dream, I was living in the Joseon period.

136
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,170
And I was wearing that bracelet.

137
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,410
The bracelet? You mean Kim Dam Ryeong's bracelet?

138
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,180
Ah, so you were Kim Dam Ryeong in the dream?

139
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,480
Yes.

140
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,650
I believe I was.

141
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,140
It's possible.

142
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,910
After seeing the movie
"The Admiral: Roaring Currents,"

143
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,720
I had a dream where I was Admiral Yi in it.

144
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,460
Aish, I'm not talking about
that kind of nonsense dream.

145
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,660
Look who's talking. Your dream is the nonsense
one. How could you be Kim Dam Ryeong?

146
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,290
Is it like you're looking back at your past life?

147
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,900
It's not like it's my past life, but I feel
like I'm looking at a parallel universe.

148
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,640
- Myself in another universe.
- You in another universe, my butt!

149
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,670
It's because I've been talking
to you about the bracelet,

150
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,590
and Si Ah told you about
the excavation of the shipwreck.

151
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,510
That's why you're having
this nonsense dream.

152
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,730
The reality is governing your dream.
You're the one who studied neurosciences.

153
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,720
How can you not realize it?

154
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,550
- Ah, is it like that? - Of course, it is.

155
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,020
Ah. I've been kind of off recently.

156
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,900
Hey. It's natural to have weird
dreams before your big projects.

157
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,070
It must be a sign that our Project
Ahn Jin Joo will be a big success.

158
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,570
Huh?

159
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,610
Yes, that girl named Seo Yoo Na.

160
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:13,080
It seems like that girl and my
Elizabeth had some troubles.

161
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,180
You know girls like that
always stand out in a poor way.

162
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,420
Oh, my. Did you get a call from her mom? Why?

163
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,590
She asked to have her included in our swim team?

164
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,100
Well... Will you let her in?

165
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,400
Of course not. That's right.

166
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,970
When there are kids like that in the
mix, it's always our kids who suffer.

167
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,240
Of course, I trust you. Then...

168
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,940
Okay. Let's talk details when we meet.

169
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,980
Okay, yes. Bye!

170
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,450
You were on the phone for 1.5 hours
but you didn't discuss the details?

171
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,690
Honey,

172
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,290
did you get to talk to Chairman Heo?

173
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,830
Well. I invited him to a dinner, but he
acts all busy and doesn't set up the time.

174
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,700
Omo, I've been providing an endless
supply of banchan (side dishes) for him

175
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,170
since I was told he liked them.

176
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,500
Is it like dine and dash? What's wrong with them?

177
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,560
He's not an easy guy.

178
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,210
If there's anything of investment value,
he'd do that himself and won't give them to us.

179
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,750
That's why we're trying this hard,

180
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,650
so he can share some of them now, huh? Gracious.

181
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,720
It's been so hard to put aside that secret fund.

182
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,600
I was so careful not to get
caught in the external audits

183
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,060
or by the National Tax Services.

184
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,890
We saved it up by putting in our blood and sweat.

185
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,700
Of course, we have. If you call this black money,

186
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,300
I feel wronged. I worked very hard for that money!

187
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,870
Preach, Honey!

188
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,680
You've worked so hard.
We really will invest this money well

189
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,280
and won't let your efforts go to waste.

190
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,520
Yes, Honey. Let's give our best tonight as well!

191
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,590
Say what?

192
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,360
- Who is it? - Korea Post.
Is Ms. Kang Seo Hee available?

193
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,830
It's court registered mail,
so she has to accept it herself.

194
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,770
How dare you show up here. Are you crazy?

195
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,140
It's not like I wanted to.
I am cold, hungry, and out of money.

196
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,380
Heo Joon Jae is not an easy target.
He wiggles his way out every time.

197
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:38,220
Chairman Heo is trying to set up meetings
with his lawyer to formalize his will.

198
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,030
Will you get your senses back
after I've lost everything?

199
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,530
What are we going to do if Chairman Heo goes to
meet Joon Jae and gives all his fortune to him?

200
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,800
Hurry and leave now.

201
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,070
- Sorry about the trouble at
this late hour.- No problem.

202
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,770
Bye.

203
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,240
Hi.

204
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,440
Oh, Chi Hyeon.

205
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,080
Do they deliver at this late hour?

206
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,320
That's what I was wondering. He must be behind
his schedule due to the busy year-end season.

207
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,190
- Have you eaten? - Yes, I have.

208
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,450
Let's go in.

209
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,790
Have you eaten, Mother?

210
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,960
Let's go in.

211
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,600
What is it?

212
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,370
Mother, did you hear about Joon Jae, by any chance?

213
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,870
How would I know?

214
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,010
I ran into him recently. By pure luck.

215
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,980
Oh, you did?

216
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,680
Did you tell your father?

217
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,590
Of course not. I'm telling you first.

218
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,860
Good job. He's been under stress
about a few things recently.

219
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,790
I think it will be better that you
don't tell him that for a while.

220
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,060
By any chance, do you know already?

221
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,070
- What? - Where Joon Jae lives and how he is.

222
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,540
I told you already that I don't know.

223
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Then why won't you ask me more about him?
Aren't you curious since I met him?

224
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,350
Your father and I have huge
scars we got from Joon Jae.

225
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,760
Wouldn't it be weird if I get all
interested when your father isn't?

226
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,100
Mother, what if Father
couldn't show his emotions

227
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,400
because of the two of us?

228
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,970
I am also sorry that their
relationship went south,

229
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,670
but I'm not sure if I'd like him to come back.

230
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,340
Don't you like how things are right now?

231
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,550
Do you think we'll keep how things
are right now when Joon Jae returns?

232
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,480
- But I... - Yes, you.

233
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,620
Do you think you could keep all that you have now?

234
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,760
Mother, I want to protect you.

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,970
My good son! However...

236
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,470
That's my job, to protect us.

237
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,280
Let's get in quickly.

238
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,150
Yes. Bye.

239
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,600
There's footage of him from the surveillance
camera from the nearby convenience store.

240
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,670
It's the back of him, though.

241
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,810
He knows blind spots like nobody's business.

242
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,370
That's why the police haven't
been able to catch him so far.

243
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,780
Hello?

244
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,250
010-3654-23

245
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,690
Who is this?

246
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,060
Hi, do you happen to know
Department Head Nam Seong Joon?

247
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,130
Who is asking about him?

248
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,960
I am...

249
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,130
Is this Joon Jae?  (using informal speech)

250
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,610
You are. This is Chi Hyeon. (using informal speech)

251
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,640
How did you get my number? (using informal speech)

252
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,410
That's not what's important.
Department Head Nam is seriously hurt.

253
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,080
Your number is the last number that
called him before the accident.

254
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,890
Where is Cheong?

255
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,160
- She went out. - To where?

256
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,660
I don't know, either.

257
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,530
How could you just let her leave?

258
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,670
When you don't know when and where
that crazy bastard will pop up.

259
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,670
He's the one who had Department
Head Nam's cell phone.

260
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,140
Oh my, why do you direct your anger at me?

261
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,310
Seriously.

262
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,350
The phone is turned off.
You'll be connected to the voicemail...

263
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,450
She's not picking up again.

264
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,290
Why does she go there so often?

265
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,160
- So, the guy said he has plans to like you. - Yes.

266
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,800
Then today is day 1.

267
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,170
Whoa. Good times.

268
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,270
The one and only day in your love life.

269
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,540
Of course, you'll have another one
when you start dating another guy.

270
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,710
Is it so?

271
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,810
What you do from now on is very important if
you want him to go head over heels for you.

272
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,220
Tell me how to make him go head over heels for me.

273
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,090
So he won't ever get his head back up again.

274
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,290
That's the way I can stay here
forever after without hurting

275
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,090
Are you Misery Chastain (from the movie Misery)?

276
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,560
And do you think I'd be like
this had I known how to do that?

277
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,330
Look. There are three different levels of love.

278
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:54,340
The first step is romantic love,
the second is hot love, the third is...

279
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,770
"Dirty love."

280
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,480
Dirty (love) belongs to the experts only.

281
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,620
In my case, I'd go straight to the dirty; but in
your case, you should start with the romantic.

282
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,590
How do you do the romantic?

283
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,120
Honestly, that one has all the
bells and whistles for a show.

284
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,290
Having tea, having meals,
going to the movies, taking you home,

285
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,100
sending texts to check up on
you, getting new sets of emojis,

286
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,150
going to see the stars, planing an event for you,

287
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,400
playing hard to get,
and confessing his feelings for you...

288
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,640
But all of this... is actually leading to dirty.

289
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,810
I'm curious about that, dirty.

290
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,940
Not yet for you.

291
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,420
That, if you go recklessly then it could really
be the end after seeing something nasty.

292
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,020
You just shoot love guns.

293
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,550
Gun? That can cause death.

294
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,020
They die, they like it so much to death.

295
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,260
Look at that! Look at that; such young'uns.

296
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,200
He's all over shooting hearts gun and all.

297
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,240
Have you made nicknames for each other? Not your
names but something only the two of you use.

298
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,170
We haven't.

299
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,410
My first man called me "mong
mong" (sound of dog barking).

300
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,050
But it ended after a dog fight.

301
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,550
Don't go towards animal names. The end isn't good.

302
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,160
What would ours be?

303
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,430
- Mermaid? - What mermaid? You need
something that's in this world.

304
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,890
There's no mermaid in this world?

305
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,190
Why are you talking like
Hans Christian Andersen has come back to life?

306
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,630
Then would there be one?

307
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,520
Hey! Why aren't you answering your phone!
What are you doing here...

308
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,250
- Say hi. She's my friend.- Oh, hello.

309
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,820
Ah...

310
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,960
Okay, let's go.

311
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,430
Hey, you come here every day
and play with this beggar?

312
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,500
I can hear it all, you know.

313
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm sorry. Let's go.

314
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm not a beggar!

315
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,580
I'm homeless! Street people!

316
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,020
I told you I'm not!

317
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,520
I'm not a beggar! I don't accept freebies!

318
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,290
Honey, Joon Jae is here.

319
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,660
Joon Jae whom you took more care of than your son.

320
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,540
You always said "Our Joon Jae, our Joon Jae."

321
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,270
Wake up, please.

322
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,940
Ahjussi did not drink and drive.

323
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,480
Have you checked the black box?

324
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,410
There was no record from that day.
It must have been broken.

325
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,450
Erasing records

326
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,030
It looks like a traumatic cataract.

327
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,740
Seeing this here, there is a small wound.

328
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,580
Perhaps, did you rub your eye hard or was it poked?

329
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,680
No. None of that happened. These days
my vision has been cloudy and darkened.

330
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,480
I thought it was because of aging.

331
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,090
At any rate, I will prescribe
anti-inflammatory medicine and antibiotics.

332
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,460
Take your medicines well. If this gets
worse, then complications could arise.

333
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,930
Since there is no vein on the cornea,

334
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:42,370
if it gets worse, there would be
no other way than a transplant.

335
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,840
Don't just take care of money but
also take care of your health.

336
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,980
Since you're here, eat dinner before you go.

337
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,020
No, I have someone I have to visit. Next time.

338
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,820
Heo Joon Jae's family.

339
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,900
At least, it's only Miss Sim Cheong
who calls me Joon Jae's family.

340
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,300
Did you come together with Joon Jae?

341
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,840
I said it last time,
but I'm not breaking up with Heo Joon Jae.

342
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,110
I get it.

343
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,180
But you two must be close.
Are you going to get married?

344
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,110
For now, we are still planning.

345
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,820
- What? - A lot of things.

346
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,930
But a family resembles each
other, warm and sweet.

347
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,900
What's wrong with you and Heo Joon Jae?

348
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,870
Father.

349
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,840
Oh, Chi Hyeon, you're here.

350
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,140
Yes, Father.

351
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,640
But, who?

352
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,810
Father, that...

353
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,580
Is this person Heo Joon Jae's family, too?

354
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,420
Are you someone who knows my Joon Jae?

355
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,020
- Ah, yes, the truth is... - Yeah.

356
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,620
Dad, after bathing, buy me some banana milk.

357
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,920
You should rub my back properly for me to buy it
for you. You can't do it sloppily like last time.

358
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,090
Buy it for me. Buy it for me.

359
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,530
Okay, you punk.

360
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,930
Oh yeah!

361
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,770
What about Joon Jae? Isn't he coming?

362
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,780
He must have slept early.
Let's just go by ourselves.

363
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,550
Let's just get him food later
when he says he's hungry.

364
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,580
Dad.

365
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,520
Okay.

366
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,020
Chi Hyeon, let's go. What do you want to eat?

367
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,290
- Steak.- Okay, steak.

368
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:24,160
Dad, I'm sick.

369
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,940
What's wrong with your face?

370
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,580
What have you been doing? Why did you get hurt?

371
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,720
You're curious about me now?

372
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,050
So who told you to leave home and suffer?

373
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,820
You're doing well.

374
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,730
I did not leave the house but I left your side,

375
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,100
and I didn't suffer that much.

376
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,270
If you compare it to being in that
house, it's much better.

377
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,540
I feel like a burden has been lifted from me, too.

378
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:09,110
What did I do, take care of
Chi Hyeon a bit more than you?

379
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,680
Doesn't a son even know his father's heart?

380
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,620
Did you really think I liked Chi Hyeon
more than you so I took care of him more?

381
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,920
You are my son. That's why I purposely—

382
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,590
You gave up.

383
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:29,730
On Mom and me. And the time that we were together

384
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:35,400
you threw it all away without looking back.

385
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,010
Since you gave up and chose something else,

386
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,610
don't hold on to what you let go and just forget it.

387
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,890
You will know as you live.

388
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,220
Life doesn't go the way you want it to.

389
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,990
I'm now old

390
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,030
and it's time to settle the inheritance.

391
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,370
So, you should come back home.

392
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,070
No.

393
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,870
I will not accept anything,

394
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,710
be it money, or the way of life,

395
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,010
or the way to throw people away, any of it.

396
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,750
I don't wish to receive anything from you.

397
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,390
I don't want to get involved with you.
I don't want to meet you ever again.

398
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,220
This punk.

399
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,490
But...

400
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,560
Please be healthy.

401
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,610
Joon Jae. Joon Jae.

402
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,160
You can leave, too, if you want to.

403
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,200
When I told you,
"Don't give up on what you have chosen,"

404
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,270
it's all nonsense.

405
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,740
Where is such a thing?

406
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:34,150
I also... was a whole lot more comfortable
and good when you weren't here.

407
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:05,810
Dad... It hurts...

408
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,250
Are you okay?

409
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,080
I saw it on TV. Doing this got them better.

410
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,920
Now you're not as hot.

411
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,590
Who told you do this kind of thing?

412
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,290
Go up.

413
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,970
You say that, but you wish that
I would stay next to you, right?

414
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,140
No matter how much you tell me to give up,
"No, I don't want to. I won't give up,"

415
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,040
is what you wish I'd say, right?

416
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,780
Forget what you've given up.
Don't have any lingering feelings.

417
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,980
No, I don't want to. I won't give up.

418
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,920
No matter what you say,
I'll stay by you without giving up,

419
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,130
so don't get angry about not being able
to say what you want and just say it.

420
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,960
What it is that you really want to say.

421
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,280
Okay.

422
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,220
I couldn't.

423
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,120
What I really wanted to say to my father.

424
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,490
I couldn't say any of it.

425
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,960
How very difficult it was
for me after leaving home.

426
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,070
I hated my father so much,

427
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,310
but because I thought he might look for me,

428
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,620
I waited for a while without
changing my phone number.

429
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,120
But because in the end, he never called me once,

430
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,760
how lonely I felt...

431
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,100
I took the qualification exam on my
own and went to college on my own,

432
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,370
and while living on my own

433
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,640
how much I missed him...

434
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,910
That I...

435
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,650
missed him so much...

436
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,300
Are you a little better?

437
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,060
Yeah.

438
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,200
- Earlier, that...  - Huh?

439
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,270
- That.  - About you crying?

440
00:34:54,110 --> 00:35:00,580
Not so much crying but that
there was a hint of tears.

441
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,240
Anyway, I took some cold medicine
before falling sleep,

442
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,620
so I wasn't in the right state of mind.

443
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,120
I don't think there's any need to
tell Nam Doo or Tae Oh about it.

444
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,630
Yeah, I forget well. Don't worry, Heo Joon Jae.

445
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,000
Okay. That's good then.

446
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,070
From now on, you tell me as much as you
want. What you can't tell the others.

447
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,140
I'll listen to everything and forget
it all, with everything in me.

448
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,020
- Really, will you forget everything? - Yeah.

449
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,220
Then...

450
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,930
Will you forget this, too?

451
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,030
♬ Enjoying unusually bright sunlight ♬

452
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,330
♬ A warm breeze is embracing us ♬

453

♬ On such a nice day, we are walking together ♬

454
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,340
What are you doing?

455
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,080
Oh, I like rice better than noodles.
Cheong is the one who likes pasta.

456
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,450
Really? I'm making it because
I wanted to have some.

457
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,790
You're doing that to eat it yourself?

458
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,760
I see.

459
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,560
Done.

460
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,930

466

♬ Just the thought of confessing to you ♬

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,200
Wow. Wow, today you're Beauty Cheong.
Beauty Cheong!

469
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,540
Wow, you're nearly a Seoulite, our Cheong.

00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,940
♬ You don't know my heart ♬

471
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,050
Just because she's pretty.

472
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,350
- Really? I'm pretty? - Yeah.

473
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,150
Hey, give me your phone.

474
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,690
Why?

475
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,190
What do you mean pretty?

476
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:09,530
You shouldn't take pictures like
this without direct permission.

477
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,940
- This isn't good manners.  - I'm okay.

478
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,210
- She says it's okay. - What do you mean it's okay?

479
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,640
Then how can she say that it's not okay
with you standing right in front of her?

480
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,050
Is Cheong the kind of person to do that?

481
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,250
♬ Whispering that, "It's today." ♬

482
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,960
♬ My love confession that
I've been withholding ♬

483
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,530
♬ I will deliver it to you ♬

484
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,060
Here.

485
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,960
Come and eat.

486
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,870
Okay. It looks delicious.

487
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,770
Joon Jae said he made it
like that to eat it himself.

488
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,280
♬ I'm in love with you, you fool ♬

489
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,210
Wow, you look so so pretty, Cheong.

490
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,010
♬ Beautiful ♬

491
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,020
What is she?

492
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,090
How is she totally fine?
I'm the only one who's feeling awkward.

493
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,160
♬ My heart keeps telling you ♬

494
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:16,300
♬ I love you. I love you. You are my girl. ♬

495
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:31,150
Joon Jae, I brought something
you might want to know about.

496
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,850
What?

497
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,750
Let's go talk over there for a sec.

498
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,890
Why? You can't say it here?

499
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,300
I have something to explain while
looking at the materials. Let's go.

500
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,730
Go ahead and eat first.

501
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,220
What are you doing?

502
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,990
Oh, just a second.

503
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,440
A few days ago, at the apartment
redevelopment construction site in Dapsimni,

504
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,570
- a Joseon era family home
site was discovered.  - And?

505
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:31,380
They said this site was Kim
Dam Ryeong's family home.

506
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,380
While Professor Ha was telling us, I was so
shocked that I came here to tell you first.

507
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,840
As soon as we restored
the relics from the shipwreck,

508
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,590
we were going to open up an exhibition.

509
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,460
If something more comes out
of this excavation site,

510
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,490
I think it'll be huge.

511
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,600
You're saying this was Kim
Dam Ryeong's family home?

512
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,030
Yeah.

513
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:11,650
- And?  - They said this site
was Kim Dam Ryeong's family home.

514
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,230
Now only 19 days remain until
the full moon of the last month.

515
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,900
What should I do?

516
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,940
What do I need to do for the person in my
dreams to believe that my existence is real?

517
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,110
What do I have to do...

518
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,900
Over here! There's something here!

519
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,940
- Where?- This side!

520
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,870
Dear, what did they tell you at the hospital?

521
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:41,670
That it's probably cataracts and
that I should take my medicine.

522
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,780
Hurry, take your medicine, and go to bed.
You look really tired today.

523
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,480
Really?

524
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,620
Aigoo.

525
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,520
Honey, since Department Head
Nam is in that condition,

526
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,290
shouldn't we hire a new person?

527
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,000
Do you want me to look into it?

528
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,330
Department Head Nam will probably
be back on his feet soon...

529
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,370
Let's wait and see.

530
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,140
Okay, sure. Lie down.

531
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,040
Sure.

532
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,400
Omo, our Goo Baek (900) came again.

533
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,800
Yes, his nose seemed a little dry.

534
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,270
Oh Baek (500) is here, too!

535
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,970
- Oh, is his name Oh Baek (500)?-Yes.

536
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,710
- My dog's name is Goo Baek (900 in Korean). Because I
spend 900 man won (9,000,000 won) on him a month. - Omo.

537
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,080
I've already spent 8,500,000
won ($8500) on him this month.

538
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,880
What do you do to spend 9,000,000 won
on him? We do everything we need to.

539
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,020
I even send him to Puppy Royal School.
Isn't that right, Oh Baek?

540
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,160
Oh, my child does some after-school activities.

541
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,930
Ahh, after-school activities.

542
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,390
What kind?

543
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,300
On Mondays, we teach him self-confidence.
He just barks into the air.

544
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,470
On Fridays, he learns about English manners.

545
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,800
- I see, English manners?
- You know, we give orders a lot here.

546
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,010
Sit. Lie down. Wait. Eat. We're very commanding.

547
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,240
They say the English way is waiting.

548
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,780
Oh, I see.

549
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,350
- I learned something today,
thanks to you.- It's nothing.

550
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,850
- Goo Baek will now go in. - Ah yes.

551
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,950
I'll see you again.

552
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,690
To start off, I got in the
good graces of our customer.

553
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,510
To the ladies of
Seocho-dong Council, Daechi-dong,

554
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,060
Apgujeong Department Store
and Culture Center,

555
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,600
there is no better gossiper than a
Gangnam broker—which I've hired this time.

556
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,270
There is a social meeting called Sawolhoe that
Ahn Jin Joo attends religiously for gossip.

557
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,110
He also put in a few words.

558
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,240
- Ladies, have you heard?  - What?

559
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,210
This really remarkable guy,
Kim Jae, just came back to Korea.

560
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,920
While overseas, he started dabbling
in international real estate,

561
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,520
and turned himself into a wealthy man.

562
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,060
This person owns a 57-floor building
in Dubai and runs a golf course.

563
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,460
I hear he often closes doors

564
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,360
to play golf with Mansour.
He's on a whole new level.

565
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,100
- For real?- Are you talking
about the Mansour we know?

566
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,800
Last year, L-construction
madam wanted to invest and

567
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,190
brought her money bags and
went all the way to Dubai,

568
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,540
but she returned after she was
unable to even see him.

569
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,550
- Really? Did Madam Choi really do that? - Of course!

570
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,250
Anyway, this guy was busy in Singapore.

571
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,350
He was in the middle of a
condominium building project,

572
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:45,720
but he came back to Korea in a hurry because...

573
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,060
of his fiancée. She lives in Seoul,
but he supposedly can't live without her.

574
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,230
- Who's the fiancée?- Is she a celebrity?

575
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,500
I don't know that far because it's been hidden
well. Anyway, it's because he's so into her

576
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:04,040
that he's been buying out all the
products in the Gangnam malls, every day.

577
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,210
Now that I've laid out the bait like
this, what should we do now?

578
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,980
All that's left is for Kim Jae and his fiancée
to strut around the malls for a week.

579
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,720
Who'll play the fiancée?

580
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,960
Hey, Tae Oh!

581
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,060
Are you kidding? You're telling me to take him?

582
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,030
He's pretty, but this is
stretching it too far, right?

583
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,030
See?

584
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,770
- What about Cheong? - Stop saying nonsense.

585
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,540
You've been super careful nowadays
and taking Cheong everywhere you go.

586
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,640
- So when you're working, are you going to leave
her by herself? - Ah, how can I take her there?

587
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,780
- Where am I going? - Gosh, you scared me.

588
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,950
Hey, Cheong! Our Cheong.

589
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,520
Would you listen to me for a moment?

590
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,520
You like dramas, right?

591
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,490
The truth is, the people in
the TV aren't small people...

592
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,830
I know. They're in a studio. It's a drama.

593
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,430
So you know?

594
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:04,070
Our Cheong is surprisingly smart.

595
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,000
Our Cheong? Our?

596
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,710
- I'm just saying she's smart.  - So then, what?

597
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:13,250
So, we're going to be filming
something like a drama.

598
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,520
Joon Jae's role in this drama is a rich, cool man.

599
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,880
General manager? Director?

600
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,920
- All the cool guys in dramas play those
kinds of roles. - Exactly like that!

601
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:29,430
And our Cheong's role is his fiancée.
They're going to get married!

602
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,030
I like it.

603
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:36,370
Right. You like it, right? See? She likes it, huh?

604
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,370
Cheong, when you're there, there are
just three things that you must not do.

605
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,180
Don't talk.

606
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,010
Don't laugh.

607
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,750
Don't eat.

608
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,080
- That's going to be a bit difficult. - I'll
buy you something more delicious afterward.

609
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,620
Specifically what?

610
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,820
You like sweet things. Ice cream? Cake?

611
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,460
- That plus... - Plus?

612
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,790
- Plus? - Sweet and sour pork.

613
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,700
Deal.

614
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,870
Me too.

615
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:11,740
Our Cheong is a real Seoulite now.

616
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,670
Let's go! To use money!

617
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,320
This, this, and this.

618
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,660
What else, Honey?

619
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,790
The 'La (Piazetta) Di Capri' one, too.

620
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,760
- Oh just buy it all. - Give us all of it.

621
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,770
The end?

622
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,870
Just give the whole thing with hangers.

623
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:49,110
Okay, this one. Okay this one, too!

624
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:52,440
Please wrap all the jewels.

625
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,590
Why can't I use the VVIP room, right now?
You said you thought I could, earlier.

626
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,860
I apologize. We have a guest who
made a reservation just a while ago.

627
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,090
I am also a guest who made a reservation just
a while ago. Have I been pushed back? Why?

628
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,130
I'm a White Magnolia Club member!

629
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:21,370
I've seen this woman before. Where?

630
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,680
What is this?

631
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,720
- Who is it?- Omo! You're here.

632
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,280
Our honey doesn't ever wear the
same pair of shoes twice.

633
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,690
We end up having to come back frequently.

634
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,790
Ah, it's not like I can carry you around
everywhere. Honey, do your feet hurt?

635
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,630
Seoul is so uncomfortable.

636
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:49,740
The buildings are so close by that we
can't ride on our private jet, unlike Dubai.

637
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,900
Dubai? Dubai?

638
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,240
Dubai?!

639
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:55,570
What's happening?

640
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:59,340
Would you check it all? Hurry up. Hurry up!

641
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,610
Goo Baek's dad?

642
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,720
Goo Baek's dad!

643
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,850
Goo Baek's dad?

644
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,420
Oh, isn't it Oh Baek's mother?

645
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,320
- Oh yes. It's good to see you!
- It's good to see you, too!

646
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,290
The people who just came...

647
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,700
Did you come with them?

648
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:24,470
Ah, yes. I run an investment company,
and some VIP guests came from abroad.

649
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:28,440
Ahh. The man who just went inside?

650
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,010
Yes, well then.

651
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:34,150
Oh wait! Did that person, perhaps,

652
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,180
did he come from Dubai?

653
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:39,820
Why?

654
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,390
Well, in Dubai, he has a 57-story building,

655
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:49,030
and a like a golf course,
and like is friends with Mansour,

656
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:51,760
and like like, what was his name again?

657
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,170
Kim Jae, and that fiancée
he's so in love with. Right?

658
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:58,370
Wait, where did you hear those things?

659
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,440
I knew it.

660
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,220
If you tell anyone else,
things will get messy around here,

661
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,910
so I'm telling you, you can't tell anyone—ever.

662
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,980
Ah, yes, yes. Yes.

663
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,320
Darling, how do you like it?

664
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,260
I'm hungry.

665
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:25,530
Mhm, I see. Great comment, as expected from you.

666
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,470
I want to eat spicy rice cakes.

667
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:34,340
You are always market friendly,
and I like that about you.

668
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,780
And soondae. (blood sausage)

669
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,950
Your standards are unmatched as always.
Alright, let's buy that too then.

670
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,280
Hurry up. Take this.

671
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,590
Alright, no problem.

672
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,620
Wait. Wait a minute.

673
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:56,230
Ah, yes. Can I ask you a favor?

674
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,300
Yes, what is it?

675
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:06,300
The thing is, do you think you could
arrange a meal with them and us just once?

676
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh, I'm actually in the position
of tending to them as well,

677
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,110
so for me to make requests and such is a bit—

678
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,850
We're actually very
interested in investments too!

679
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:19,550
I just want to try maybe put in a word
or two. What do you think? Impossible?

680
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:25,890
The truth is, our CEO Kim has
been away from Korea for so long

681
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,690
he did mention that he wanted
to eat home cooked Korean food.

682
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,630
But I'm still not married so—

683
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:36,870
Home cooked food! Then our house is a
must, the food at our place is killer!

684
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:40,170
At our house...we have the female Baek Jong Won.
(famous restaurant entrepreneur in Korea)

685
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,140
Ah.

686
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,080
So?

687
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,410
He said he'll mention it to them.

688
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,550
Honey, if we can get this done,
then we've hit the jackpot!

689
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:52,820
It's awesome. Totally awesome.

690
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,590
I mean, just as when things were starting
to work out, it gets solved like this!

691
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,420
Just like that! Don't you think?

692
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,890
Ahjumma! Please take good care of us!

693
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,300
I'll just be doing as I always do.

694
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,800
Who is it?

695
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,130
Don't be surprised.

696
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,170
They said he's so close to
Mansour; they play golf together.

697
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,570
Totally awesome.

698
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:12,970
You don't think he's a con artist?

699
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,540
What do you mean?

700
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,910
I mean, I get the feeling he's a
con artist just by listening to you.

701
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,340
Is that so?

702
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,080
What do you mean? I even called
Madam Choi of L-construction, and

703
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,880
I even confirmed that she went to
Dubai last year only to get rejected!

704
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,820
Right. Then it's for sure.

705
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,490
If you're not going to help us,
at the very least, don't ruin it for us.

706
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:34,830
Even if we got him millions of dollars
right now, he wouldn't spare a glance!

707
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:35,660
Of course, he wouldn't.

708
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,730
And that's what you'd expect
from a typical Ponzi scheme.

709
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,430
He pulls in investors as if
they could gain high profit,

710
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,010
but he doesn't let just anyone in,
which makes you all the more ambitious to get in,

711
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,870
or something like that.

712
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,740
Then, when we invite him over to eat,

713
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,380
Auntie, you can stay and see him
with us.That's what we can do.

714
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,950
Yeah, you can eat with us.

715
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:59,180
Whatever.

716
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,790
Hello? Yeah, hold on.

717
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,760
Really? Where is it right now?

718
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,330
Wow, our Cheong did really well today.

719
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,770
I did well?

720
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:22,670
Yeah! What— You were just like
a secret agent! Right, Joon Jae?

721
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,810
Well, she was whatever— I told you
before, this kid's smart.

722
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,050
When you teach her one thing,
she catches on really fast!

723
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,220
What are you, her parent?
Are you bragging about your kid right now?

724
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,720
I'm just saying.

725
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,820
I had fun today too, because I could
help Heo Joon Jae with his good deeds.

726
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,900
But Heo Joon Jae, did you know? The man in charge
of that doll picking machine is a con artist.

727
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,760
Huh?

728
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,600
Who said that?

729
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,500
I kept trying to pull one but I
couldn't get any so I asked around

730
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,740
and people told me he's a con artist. Sick bastard.

731
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,510
Con artist. Right. Con artists are
definitely sick bastards, right?

732
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,850
But! Con artists aren't always bad people.

733
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,320
Sometimes, there are just sick
bastards who con even sicker bastards.

734
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,990
Still, they're lying to people.

735
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,790
Cheong, you've never done that?
Not once lied to people?

736
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,660
You don't have any secrets you can't tell us?

737
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,500
I feel like you do.

738
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,600
Just stop! Why are you cornering her like that!

739
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,170
What's this? Are you really the parent, or what?

740
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,780
Tae Oh, isn't this weird!?
He's just completely sticking up for her!

741
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,780
Between the two of you, is there a
change in your relationship or something?

742
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:35,850
- No. - Yes.

743
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:39,890
What?! What's the answer?! You said
yes and no!? What's the right answer!?

744
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:42,850
Just be quiet! Don't chat in my car.

745
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:44,960
If you're going to chat, then get off!

746
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,960
Oh, Si Ah. Really?

747
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,300
I'll be right there.

748
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,470
Let me out. I have to go somewhere.

749
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,440
You are really going to get out?
Where are you going?

750
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,380
Si Ah said she has something to show me.

751
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,520
I haven't seen it yet, either,
but the underclassman that excavated it

752
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,390
says this one's really special.

753
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:20,060
Typically, porcelains or paintings and
calligraphic works excavated from a house

754
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,060
cannot be preserved in good condition.

755
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:27,930
But this one—it was buried
in a completely sealed box.

756
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,370
Buried?

757
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:34,510
Yeah. As if, someone was asking
for it to be found in the future.

758
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,620
- Wait a minute.- Hm?

759
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,320
Can I look at it by myself for a minute?

760
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,460
Ah, well, sure.

761
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,900
Epilogue

762
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,010
From now and to the full moon of the last
month of the year, there remain 19 days.

763
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,280
What shall I do? What must I do

764
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,620
for the person in my dream to believe me?

765
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,420
What must I do?

766
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:12,060
♬ Being under the same sky with you ♬

767
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,630
I ask that you be meticulous.

768
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,410
- Because it is a piece that must be
preserved for a long time.  - Yes.

769
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:27,350
♬ If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon ♬

770
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:35,150
♬ I won't let go of your hand. ♬

771
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,990
♬ Being under the same sky with you ♬
