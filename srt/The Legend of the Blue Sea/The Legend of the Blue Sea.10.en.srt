1
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,870
If you are me in the next life,

2
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,380
just remember these words even
after waking from the dream.

3
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,480
Everything is repeating itself.

4
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,990
The fate in this world is
continuing in that world.

5
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,500
It's the same way with ill-fate.

6
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:35,370
Protect that woman against
the dangerous person.

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,300
When you go to Hanyang, give this to my mother,

8
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,470
and ask her to bury this chest 10-ja
(3-meter) deep in the backyard.

9
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,540
Yes, Master.

10
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:22,950
Tell her even if anything should
happen to me, to not open it

11
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,930
and to leave it in that place.

12
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,700
If something should happen?
What are you referring to?

13
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,240
Kim Dam Ryeong was appointed as
the Town Head of the Heupgok-Hyeon.

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,010
December 11th of the same year,

15
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,510
he died at the young age of 27.

16
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,440
He died?

17
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,450
I beg this favor of you.

18
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,460
What are you?

19
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,130
Who is the dangerous one, and who is the woman?

20
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,330
Who are you?

21
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,570
Are you really... me?

22
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,350
Not a dream... but really me?

23
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,990
The Legend of the Blue Sea

24
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,930
Joon Jae, I think the power's out.

25
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,340
Oh!

26
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,880
Why is the light like this all of a sudden?
I was so scared alone.

27
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,380
You're not scared anymore, right?

28
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,820
Yeah, I'm fine now.

29
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,920
Anyway, did you get a good look?

30
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,590
Sure. Let's go.

31
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,560
You're going to look at it by yourself?
I want to see, too.

32
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,430
It's raining outside and getting late.
Don't you have to get home?

33
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,700
I'm fine.

34
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,610
Our curator said that the guy from Joseon
period looks as handsome as a K-pop singer.

35
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,740
She said so.

36
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,730
You saw all of it, right? Let's go.

37
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,570
You felt it, too, right? He looks exactly like you.

38
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,530
Like me?

39
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,900
Can't you tell?

40
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,970
Does having big eyes and being
handsome make them all look like me?

41
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,070
No, he really looks like you.

42
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,110
Well, I can't say... I

43
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,550
I look better.

44
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,320
Let's go.

45
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,460
Perhaps, could he be your ancestor?

46
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,660
No, wait, you're a Heo.
Maybe, he's from your mother's side?

47
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,430
Why are you being like that?

48
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,770
I mean, take a look through your ancestry.

49
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:30,840
This is weird. Maybe, isn't the reason you
were really interested in Kim Dam Ryeong

50
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,450
because of the blood relation?

51
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,850
- Cha Si Ah. - Yes?

52
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,980
- The fact that we came here. - Yeah.

53
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,590
Let's just keep that to ourselves.

54
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,160
Why?

55
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,590
This place is off-limits to unauthorized
personnel. I don't want to get you in trouble,

56
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,170
and I'm in the middle of figuring something out.
I would like it if only you knew about this.

57
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,100
Sure, I'll do that.

58
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,810
Why do I keep getting this dream? I don't like it.

59
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,550
Episode 10

60
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,160
What's going on, Heo Joon Jae? Why aren't you
coming back after getting Cha Si Ah's phone call?

61
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,540
Heo Joon Jae, what time is it right now?

62
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,070
Right now? Eleven pm.

63
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,810
What time is our curfew? Eight pm, right?

64
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,710
You told me not to come back if
I was going to break the curfew.

65
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,950
That applies only to free-loaders
that live in my house, not to me.

66
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,790
- Why not? - Because, I'm the house owner.

67
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,960
Is it usually like that here?

68
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
Yes. Everything is the way the
house owner wants it to be.

69
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
That's the rule.

70
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,370
If you think it's unfair,
buy a house yourself, and live there.

71
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,070
I'm so tired.

72
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,580
Gosh, you scared me.

73
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,150
When you glare at me like that,
you look like a ghost. Stop looking!

74
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,620
I'm going to keep looking at you like this.

75
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,360
Why?

76
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
They're my eyes. Since, I'm the owner,

77
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,590
I decide if I want to glare at
you or look at you normally.

78
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,400
This is my rule, to glare at you when
I'm angry but have nothing to say.

79
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,100
- So? You're going to keep
looking at me like that?- Yes.

80
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,970
Why?

81
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,900
Because I want to look at you to make
up for the time I couldn't look at you.

82
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,380
Do as you like. You'll probably be dizzy.

83
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,350
Oh yeah.

84
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,090
Let me ask you something.

85
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,890
What?

86
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,460
When you got into that car accident, at the ER...

87
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,370
Yes?

88
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,670
You said that you had a dream, right?

89
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,500
Heo Joon Jae.

90
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,540
Are you okay?

91
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,040
I had a dream.

92
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,010
You held my hand.

93
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,410
You rescued me.

94
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,420
Yeah, you're right. I did.

95
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,950
What kind of dream?

96
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:06,120
So, in the dream, how did I save you?

97
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,810
I mean, there are several ways to save a person.

98
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,140
I could have grabbed you when you
were about to fall off a high place,

99
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,780
or I could have lifted you out of a deep pit.

100
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,180
How did I do it?

101
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,150
You don't remember? Okay.

102
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,860
Then, what about the time period?
What time period was it?

103
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,630
Perhaps, was I wearing old
time traditional clothes?

104
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,960
You know what old time traditional
clothes look like, right?

105
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,030
You know that drama you like, The Crown
Prince's Woman? Clothes that they wear in that.

106
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,110
- The thing is... - Yes?

107
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,780
- The thing is, I don't really remember.

108
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,320
I really can't remember it at all.

109
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,020
Okay. I'm sure that's the case.

110
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,430
You can't even remember your own name.
How would you remember that?

111
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,060
Okay. Go back up.

112
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,760
Okay. Heo Joon Jae, sleep well!

113
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,570
What was that?
She said she would watch me all night.

114
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,540
Thinking about it now, she really doesn't
take responsibility for her words.

115
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,010
I feel restless for no reason now.

116
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,490
So this is what lying feels like.

117
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,290
It makes my heart pound a
little, but it is convenient.

118
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,890
It's a good thing Heo Joon
Jae cannot hear my real voice.

119
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,570
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,740
I came too late.

121
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,730
What are you doing?

122
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,530
Why are you coming out in the middle of sleeping?

123
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,600
Give me one too.

124
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,970
I'm really a little strange these days.

125
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,640
Why? Did you dream about
being Kim Dam Ryeong again?

126
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,710
No.

127
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,440
Joon Jae.

128
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,920
Do you know what you have to find the strangest?

129
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,680
- What?  - Cheong.

130
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,750
Don't you find Cheong strange?

131
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,290
She's naturally a little strange.

132
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,260
Again, don't try to just
gloss over it like that again.

133
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,440
Fine, Cheong is pretty and sweet-hearted.

134
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,410
She really seems as if she's
from an entirely different world,

135
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,270
but she's strange.

136
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,500
Truthfully, last time, when we went to
the hospital I asked for Cheong's X-ray films

137
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,480
and showed them to a doctor hyung I know.

138
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,280
Why did you do something like that?!

139
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,160
Don't get all worked up and just listen. They said
the films got switched but I didn't think so.

140
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,730
If you were your normal self,
you would have been suspicious too,

141
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,930
but you seem to be losing your
wits when it comes to Cheong these days.

142
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,290
And?

143
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,800
He says the films weren't switched?

144
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,100
He says that the films are
definitely of one person.

145
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,740
A broken bone that may not have
even fused after six weeks,

146
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,870
reattached after not even a week, and she
was perfectly sprightly even after that.

147
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,340
Isn't it strange?

148
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,380
And this.

149
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,490
A kid that has no job or skills here

150
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,420
keeps this kind of thing in a plastic
bag, this much worth,

151
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,230
saying she'll sell all of them and give it to you.

152
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,960
Where did she get this?

153
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's what I don't know.

154
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,170
And also, it's certain that
you met Cheong in Spain,

155
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,040
but you still can't remember it all this time.

156
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,450
Why do you think that is?

157
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,480
You said that was why you were
letting Cheong live in this house.

158
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,150
You must not even be curious
about that anymore, huh?

159
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,320
Then what about you, Hyung?
Why are you curious about that?

160
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,330
Me? I'm afraid that you'll
become a good guy, Joon Jae.

161
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,700
I've barely made you a bad guy
and now you're finally useful.

162
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,900
After meeting Cheong, you seem to want to become
a good guy, so it's giving me cause for concern.

163
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,170
If you become a good guy, you'll leave me.

164
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,240
You're saying all kinds of useless things.

165
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,510
I'm curious as to what kind of kid
she is too. It's interesting, right?

166
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,980
I'm going to make sure to find out. Oh, I've got to pee.

167
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,920
I think I've got to be the first to
find out what kind of kid you are.

168
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,500
Squad Chief, look at this.

169
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,470
What is it?

170
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,700
I looked through Ma Dae Young's
previous convictions records again.

171
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,600
I told you to catch him.

172
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,410
Why were you looking through
his previous conviction records again?

173
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,040
He's got 13 previous convictions
mostly for violence. Why?

174
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,210
Because he has an anger management control
defect. But there's something that's strange.

175
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,120
What?

176
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,850
From '88-'89, in the space of that one year,
he committed over thirty cases of burglary.

177
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,420
And at a department store in Seongnam,

178
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,430
in a mart shopping mall.

179
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,660
Ma Dae Young Record  Serious Crime Squad

180
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,000
Why?

181
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,270
During this time,

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,070
he had a woman.

183
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,050
Are you okay, Father?

184
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,020
It's because I keep getting a little dizzy.

185
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,160
Honey, make sure to take your
medicine well after eating your meal.

186
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,290
It's really a concern.

187
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,830
It keeps getting worse.

188
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,500
Honey, don't go to work
today and stay home and rest.

189
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,140
If there's something important, tell me.

190
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,340
I'll relay it to Secretary Kim.

191
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,680
Have some, Father.

192
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,290
Yu Na. You have a make-up class at Korean
hakwon (after school academy). Don't be late.

193
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,250
What are you going to do if
you get the pink octopus?

194
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,380
- Oh, hi. - Hi.

195
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,250
But how did you know about this place?

196
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,160
I didn't go to school today, but upon not going
to school, I suddenly had no place to go.

197
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,590
I remembered you said you lived in this
neighborhood before, so I tried coming this way.

198
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,930
But how did you know that I thought that I had
to pull out the pink octopus no matter what?

199
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,270
I knew since you said it.

200
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,170
When I was coming up behind, you kept saying
that you wanted to make sure to pull that one.

201
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,940
I didn't.

202
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,240
That wasn't a voice you could hear.

203
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,810
Well anyway, I heard.

204
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
Watch.

205
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,390
I got it, right?

206
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,220
Hey, Sim Cheong.

207
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,160
Where did she go again?

208
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,930
Anyhow, she gets around well.

209
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,480
Really.

210
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,480
Where did she get all of these?

211
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,180
But why is she saying that she'll
make money and give it all to me?

212
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,060
When did I ask her for money? What is it?

213
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,190
Oh yes. Oh Baek's mother. You called again.

214
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,930
Of course. I did speak to him.

215
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,160
It's not easy to schedule
appointments with our president.

216
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,630
He's originally such a busy individual.

217
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,910
Yes, I'll try to speak to him further about it
but please don't have any big expectations.

218
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,410
Aigoo, yes, yes. Yes.

219
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,710
Hey, this ahjumma is really hyped up.

220
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,380
Why are you so hyper now?

221
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,620
Are you looking for someone? Cheong?

222
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,720
No. Where's Tae Oh?

223
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,560
Are you really a con artist?
Why are you so bad at lying?

224
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,570
Hey, did I tell you to charge
your cell phone or not?

225
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,370
Why do you carry it around turned off?
Is it a decoration? Is it a weapon?

226
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,010
- It's dead.  - It's not dead, but it's turned off.

227
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,240
Give it some food. You don't miss out on
one meal for yourself and eat so well,

228
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,710
but don't you get the idea that he might be hungry?

229
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,120
The phone gets discharged.
It's not that it's hungry.

230
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,290
- What are you about?  - She's my friend.

231
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,860
Let's go inside.

232
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,120
Why are all your friends like that?

233
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,330
Last time it was a beggar,
this time it's an elementary schooler?

234
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,100
Ahjussi, (you're one to talk), you're unemployed.

235
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,740
Who is an ahjussi and who is a bum?
You're wrong on both counts.

236
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,340
At a time when others are going to
work, if you're lazing about the house,

237
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,640
lying down and watching TV, or playing
games, it says you are unemployed.

238
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,620
- Heo Joon Jae, you're unemployed?
- I'm not unemployed.

239
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,420
I'm... a freelancer.

240
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,920
It's a specialized job so I can work from home.

241
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,840
That's true.

242
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,890
Heo Joon Jae is a person who works for the
country more diligently than a civil servant.

243
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:14,530
He redistributes wealth also. So when you grow
up later you have to become like Heo Joon Jae.

244
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,170
You can't!

245
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,310
Do you think that just anyone can become like me?

246
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,780
Wait, but did that little one
already start winter break?

247
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,280
Aren't you going to school?

248
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,250
Are you cutting school?!

249
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,650
Why are you skipping school and coming here?!

250
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,890
You said that you were wiring
this money to America, right?

251
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,730
There's usually a wire transfer fee of 20,000 won
(20 USD) that's added and a foreign exchange fee...

252
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,230
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,870
There's also something called an overseas
brokerage fee that's added separately.

254
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,040
If you look at this it will be
a little easier to understand.

255
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,440
I'm not going to go to school.

256
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,910
Why aren't you going to school?

257
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,080
You didn't go to school and left home too.

258
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,580
For me, it was when I was in high school.
She's in elementary school, right now.

259
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,250
She has to go to school.
She has to learn her equations.

260
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,820
Tell us. There has to be a reason.

261
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,620
Are those kids from before bothering you again?

262
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,090
Whenever I go to school,
I develop supernatural powers.

263
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,160
What supernatural power?

264
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,100
I become an invisible person.
The kids, no one can see me well.

265
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,410
They don't speak to me either.
So I don't have to go to school.

266
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,180
As it is, no one knows even if I don't go.

267
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,550
Why do the kids do that?

268
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,520
Since I'm different from the other kids.

269
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:50,060
Where I live is different, and since I
live only with my mom, I think that's why.

270
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,900
Don't people normally dislike people
who are different from themselves?

271
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,510
I'm different too. Heo Joon Jae will probably
dislike me too, if he realizes I'm different.

272
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,650
He'll probably leave, right?

273
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,850
Why are you different?

274
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:19,390
If you're different, why will the ahjussi
called Heo Joon Jae dislike you and leave you?

275
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,230
What? What's different and
what does Heo Joon Jae dislike?

276
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,530
Just now Unni said so.

277
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,740
- Did you hear it?  - No.

278
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,560
Our Little One skipped school
for the first time in her life

279
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,340
and must have strained herself from the nerves,

280
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,810
hearing imaginary things.

281
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,980
That's not so. I definitely heard it.

282
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,690
Want to go to Unni's room? Let's go.

283
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,290
Both of you

284
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,530
really didn't hear what that
little one just said, right?

285
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,600
Hear what? I didn't hear anything.
Did you hear something?

286
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,100
No.

287
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,470
Yes, Ahjummoni.

288
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,410
Ahjussi did?

289
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,150
Can you really hear what I'm saying?

290
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,080
Tell me as soon as you can hear me.

291
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,920
I came from a far away place.

292
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
I came from a far away place.

293
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,060
It's true.

294
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:37,500
So I'm lonely too. I came all the
way here looking only at one man.

295
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,810
It's real. You can really
hear the entirety of my voice.

296
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,040
- Can other people not hear it? - Yeah.

297
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,650
But don't tell this to anyone else.

298
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,380
You said it before. People dislike
people who are different from themselves.

299
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,320
There will be big trouble if Heo Joon Jae
dislikes me so don't tell this to anyone.

300
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,420
All right. I'll promise.

301
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,400
Promise. You promised.

302
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,560
Okay.

303
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,400
Ahjussi!

304
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
Joon Jae.

305
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,910
It's such a relief that
you gained consciousness.

306
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:23,250
But he can just open his eyes. He can't talk or move.

307
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,750
I prayed just for him not to
die, but now that he's awake

308
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,020
I'm becoming more greedy.

309
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,490
I wish he would just talk or
he would just move his finger.

310
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,830
He will get better.
He has overcome the brink of death.

311
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,370
Why is this man like this?

312
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,310
He must have something he wants to tell you.

313
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,380
Joon Jae.

314
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,960
Have you heard any news from your mother?

315
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,190
No. Why?

316
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,530
Perhaps... have you heard news about my mother?

317
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:18,240
The truth is... before, I used to
get calls from your mother sometimes.

318
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
She called?

319
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,740
She told me not to tell anyone,
so I wasn't able to tell you. I'm sorry.

320
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,910
Where is she?

321
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,650
That, I don't know.

322
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,090
Her last call was a few years back.

323
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,150
She just asks for news about you.

324
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,420
I wasn't able to tell her you ran away.

325
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,160
I told her not to worry since you went to
a good college and went to study abroad.

326
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,260
I just told her those things.

327
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,980
Heo Joon Jae, what are you doing?

328
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,780
Don't come down.

329
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,980
Okay.

330
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,430
You know what "don't come down" means, right?

331
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,800
Is this alcohol?

332
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,540
You also know that?

333
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,370
I saw it a lot on TV.

334
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,510
When people drink this,
they laugh, cry, talk, fight

335
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,710
and sleep on the streets. Stuff like that.

336
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,350
That... is all what Hyung Nam Doo does.

337
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,780
Do you know why his nickname is Dog Nam Doo?

338
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,790
It's because he becomes a dog when he
drinks. That's why he is Dog Nam Doo.

339
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,560
Acting cute which he doesn't know how to do,

340
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,890
calling his ex or current
girlfriend and bothering them.

341
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,660
He keeps on repeating what he says
and always denies being drunk.

342
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,730
That is because of learning
alcohol the wrong way initially.

343
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,840
In my case, I don't necessarily like alcohol.

344
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,340
That's why I can enjoy
alcohol while controlling it.

345
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,180
Then, Heo Joon Jae, teach me how to drink alcohol.

346
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,290
You want to?

347
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,620
You... Do you want to have a drink with me?

348
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,910
Here, alcohol...

349
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,550
You can't learn to drink it like that.

350
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,420
Do you know why you're drinking?
You're drinking to cheer.

351
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,660
Cheers?

352
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,230
Hold it up like this.

353
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,160
Cheers.

354
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,170
I like "cheers" so much. Let's do cheers again.

355
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,570
Cheers.

356
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,110
- Cheers. - Let's do cheers again.

357
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,340
Cheers. Cheers!

358
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,750
Oc-to-pus.

359
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,530
Why are you so dry like this?

360
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,290
It is dried. It's dried octopus.

361
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,460
People are so cruel.

362
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,770
How could they

363
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,340
cook, slice, dry

364
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,340
and do those things to you?

365
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,780
He's so pitiful.

366
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,010
For a person who goes wild over sashimi—

367
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,550
He is different. To me, an octopus is

368
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,890
like a dog to you humans.

369
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:59,260
You don't know how well they stick to you.

370
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,390
"You humans?"

371
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,600
Then aren't you one?

372
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,330
Of course not.

373
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,370
You say, you're not?

374
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,710
If not, what are you?

375
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,640
I am... a mer...

376
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,960
Heo Joon Jae, I was drunk a while ago, right?

377
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,520
Did you wake up?

378
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,360
Oh... I was so dizzy just a while ago.

379
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,730
But I just came to my senses all
of a sudden. Here, let's cheers.

380
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,440
Wow. Your recuperative skill is great.

381
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,450
Know that it's a relief that you're
learning how to drink from me.

382
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,580
In my case, I don't particularly like alcohol.

383
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,750
That's why I can enjoy it while controlling it.

384
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,820
- You also said that earlier. - What I'm saying is...

385
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,960
That's why you should think it's such a relief.

386
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,830
In my case, I don't particularly like alcohol

387
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,900
so I can control, control, control while doing it...

388
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,500
You should really think it's a relief.

389
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,650
- Heo Joon Jae.  - Why?

390
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,690
No one can go home.

391
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,360
This is home, though, Heo Joon Jae.

392
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,030
Especially you.

393
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,040
Me?

394
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,210
You can't go. You can't go.

395
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,140
Don't go.

396
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,180
Don't go.

397
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,250
I'm not going. And I don't have a place to go.

398
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,430
Just you try to leave your phone off again.

399
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,000
I... told you clearly.

400
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,230
Unless you are home, you should stay by my side.

401
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,270
But then, this one doesn't understand.
No, she doesn't listen.

402
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,370
- Oh, my phone. - Hey!

403
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,480
Where are you going? Don't move.

404
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,180
Stay here.

405
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,380
The person you are calling cannot answer...

406
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,550
She's not answering again.

407
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,260
She always ignores my calls.

408
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,060
Sim Cheong! Sim Cheong! Sim Cheong!

409
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,170
I didn't buy you a phone for this.

410
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,610
Don't move.

411
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,180
Where are you? Come here.

412
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,930
♬  More than any word your eyes  ♬

413
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,800
You can't go! Anywhere!

414
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,700
♬ mean more, I can sense it ♬

415
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,370
I'm not going, Heo Joon Jae.

416
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,900
♬ In last night's dream while you smiled ♬

417
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,010
Alcohol is really good.

418
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,180
I think alcohol is the
greatest thing in the land.

419
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,280
Don't go.

420
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,150
♬ On the path I walked alone ♬

421
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,190
Even if you are different,

422
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,220
no matter how different you are,

423
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,660
♬ Why will I remember it forever? ♬

424
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,900
I won't leave you.

425
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,200
♬ How could that be? ♬

426
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,040
♬ Come a bit closer to me ♬

427
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,580
♬ So that I can feel you better ♬

428
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,550
♬ Even the time spent waiting is meaningful ♬

429
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,890
♬ From the moment you come to me ♬

430
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,820
I wish this is not a lie.

431
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,790
♬ Come a step closer ♬

432
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,190
I wish this is sincere.

433
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,830
♬ I can even feel your breath ♬

434
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,640
♬ My heart is leaning toward you ♬

435
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,140
♬ Bit by bit, bit by bit ♬

436
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,250
♬ Bit by bit ♬

437
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,490
At this rate, won't Heo Joon Jae die?
That's the seventh time.

438
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,030
He'll go to the brink of death but won't
die. That is the beauty of alcohol.

439
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,160
How did you end up drinking with Heo Joon Jae?

440
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,930
He said it's important from
whom you learn to drink.

441
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,400
You should have learned from me!

442
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,940
But Heo Joon Jae said this,

443
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,770
"Do you know why he's called Dog Nam Doo? That's
because he becomes a dog when he's drunk."

444
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,240
Oh, that's right. But the person whom Heo Joon
Jae learned that from was me. He's my pupil.

445
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,820
Anyhow, are things that drunk
people say truths or lies?

446
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,390
Half and half. In Joon Jae's case,

447
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,400
they're all lies. Complete lies.

448
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,070
The conversations you have with drunk Joon Jae,

449
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,440
consider them the same as speaking
to a puppy. It's all nonsense.

450
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,510
Huh. I see.

451
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,380
Why? What did Joon Jae say?

452
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,910
What did Joon Jae say?!

453
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,880
Ahn Jin Joo has a 3:00 appointment at the vet.

454
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,490
Okay, let's move.

455
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,460
Please use leash.Please pick up after your dog.

456
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,400
Oh Baek is back again.

457
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,270
This one

458
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,540
keeps wagging his tail.

459
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,810
Wouldn't that be because he
loves his mother so much?

460
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,650
No, he's usually really chic like me,

461
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,750
and doesn't care whether or
not people would come and go,

462
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,020
but now he was acting hyper
and wagging his tail too much.

463
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,920
I was wondering if there was
something wrong going on mentally.

464
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,830
Ah. I'll take him.

465
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,600
Does Goo Baek's dad come here nowadays?

466
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,200
There he comes.

467
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,400
Omo! I haven't seen you in a while!

468
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,770
- Hi. How are you? - It's been
so hard to get in touch with you.

469
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,340
I'm sorry. I've been quite busy nowadays.

470
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,410
Goo Baek became the class president.

471
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,710
He's the class president?

472
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,220
Yes, he doesn't bite his friends and has
been peeing and pooping in the right areas,

473
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,750
so he became the model student, and it seems
that the teacher's looked favorably upon him.

474
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,080
The mothers of his peers kept
saying to treat them to a meal,

475
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,660
so I'm here to buy organic dog gum.

476
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,400
I thought he looked quite well-behaved.
You must be happy.

477
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,470
He keeps barking whenever he
sees dirty or talkative people.

478
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,370
He seems to have gained
a sense of responsibility

479
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,540
after becoming class president.

480
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,210
Oh, I see.

481
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,880
But, were you able to

482
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,340
talk to CEO Jae about me?

483
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:37,180
The thing is, I did bring you up,

484
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,990
- but I think it'll be a bit difficult. - Why?

485
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,590
His meal schedule is really full.

486
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,230
He's actually in Japan right now to
have some sushi with his fiancée.

487
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:52,360
Omo! You said he likes home-cooked
Korean food! Why is he eating sushi?

488
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,840
I'm sorry. He receives so many requests
like this that he must feel uncomfortable.

489
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,770
That's why I'm requesting this of you.

490
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,410
We really put in a lot of
effort to save up this money,

491
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,250
so we want to invest it in a reliable place.

492
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,250
- Also this... - What is it?

493
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,350
- Just take this one. - No, no, no.
- Feed Goo Baek with this.

494
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,420
This is dog food that someone
I know personally made

495
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,830
out of home-grown sweet
potatoes and sesame seeds.

496
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,700
This is something you can't even buy! It's alright.

497
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,830
Just take it. Take it.

498
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,370
Aigoo, it's okay.

499
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,600
Well then, I'll

500
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,910
just be waiting for good news.

501
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,980
Unni, I'm telling you, he's a con artist.

502
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,580
What con artist would reject me so much?

503
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,150
It's a strategy.

504
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,460
Ji Yong's aunt, I'm sorry to
bother you while you're resting.

505
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,290
- Yes? - When you put in the laundry,

506
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,730
could you put your outer clothes in this
basket and your underclothes in the other?

507
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,700
It makes me work a lot extra.

508
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,640
Excuse me, that extra work...

509
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,140
Isn't that the reason why we have you here?

510
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,380
Yes, that's right.

511
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,720
But if you could just be a little more
considerate, my job would be a lot easier.

512
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,150
I was going to say this a while ago,

513
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,020
but who is the boss here?

514
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,090
Are you my mother-in-law?

515
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,660
It's like I'm living with my in-laws.

516
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,200
- I don't want to be that either. - What?

517
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,070
I also don't have any intention to
become your mother-in-law either.

518
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,580
Unni, are you not going to fire that woman, truly?

519
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:49,410
Even if I fire her, I need to wait
until after this dinner happens.

520
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:54,120
I can't before that.
You know that ahjumma is an amazing cook.

521
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,620
You said that ahjumma has a son, right?

522
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,290
I feel bad for the person who
will become her daughter-in-law.

523
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,470
Gosh, why are they fighting in my house?

524
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,970
Why am I the one uncomfortably
caught in the middle?

525
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,080
Yes, Gu Baek's father!

526
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,720
You were able to arrange his schedule?

527
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,560
Thank you so much!

528
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,660
So, when is he free?

529
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,430
Honey! Honey!

530
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,270
Do you think this outfit looks
better, or the one before?

531
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,470
You did change, right? Is different from before...

532
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,040
Never mind.

533
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,350
Ahjumma. Ahjumma!

534
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,880
What do you think?

535
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,350
Isn't it bright and fitting for Christmas?

536
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:04,760
As a grown-up dress, it looks a bit frumpy.

537
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,390
Why?

538
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,760
It looks frumpy?

539
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,830
But, wear what you would like, Ma'am.

540
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:19,910
What about this? It looks active and good.

541
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,380
Doesn't it look a little shabby?

542
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,350
But just wear whatever you'd like, Ma'am.

543
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
What do you think of this one?

544
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,860
I like it.

545
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,690
It's okay? What a relief.

546
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,830
Yes, it's passable.

547
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,000
Don't wear a bunch of different
accessories with that.

548
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,800
It would look good with
just one statement piece...

549
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,940
Oh, okay. I should wear a bracelet.

550
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,210
I think a necklace rather than
a bracelet would look better...

551
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,940
Necklace?

552
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,180
Do whatever you'd like.

553
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,120
Why do I feel like I'm doing
everything that ahjumma tells me to do?

554
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,920
Somehow she doesn't say anything wrong.
So annoying.

555
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,660
When will he get here?

556
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,460
The Dubai guest.

557
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,500
Yes, like I said before, it's not like this person

558
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,270
doesn't have money.
The base of running his business is...

559
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,100
The skirt's too short!

560
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,810
Wear a long one!
One that comes down to here! Go change!

561
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,480
...where the heart goes.

562
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,880
So that's why he thinks that being invited
to a meal at home is more important

563
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,220
than eating at an expensive restaurant.

564
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,290
Anyway, I was barely able
to arrange this meeting.

565
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,620
So,

566
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,390
we can't approach him with the
mindset that we're giving him money.

567
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:49,960
We need to approach him with our sincerity.

568
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,870
But, Si Ah said that

569
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,740
they might be con artists.
I keep thinking of that...

570
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,870
What does your younger sister know?
Does she know how the world works?

571
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,410
She's stuck in her lab all the time and studies
hundred-year-old roof tiles and rafters.

572
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,480
- She only talks only those types of artifacts.
What would she know?  - That's what I say.

573
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,250
So, don't try to check

574
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,350
his qualifications pointlessly.
That's so old-fashioned.

575
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,420
Don't do it, Dear!

576
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,530
Why would you cross-check in front of them?
You obviously do it behind their backs.

577
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,530
Where is Si Ah? Is she not coming?

578
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,060
She's on her way home, after stopping by at the lab.

579
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,930
Why is she so late?

580
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,360
You can't say my name in there.

581
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,730
- Heo Joon Jae? - Don't!

582
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:57,200
I told you last time. My name's Kim Jae Yi.

583
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,900
But why do I have to do that?

584
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:05,040
It's just... Just think of it as a business
thing! Now shush, I'm going to ring the bell.

585
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,250
I think your guests are here.
Should I go out and greet them?

586
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,820
No! We'll go! Okay?

587
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,260
Remember to greet them properly. Okay let's go!

588
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,490
- Elizabeth! Okay, she's ready, let's go! - Let's go!

589
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,470
- Oh my, hello! Please come in!
- Hello, it's nice to meet you.

590
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,540
- It didn't feel right coming empty-handed,
so... - Welcome-! Oh my, thank you!

591
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,210
The weather's so cold, isn't it?

592
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,080
I mean...

593
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,110
We met once before.

594
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:53,420
Yoo Na, and our Elizabeth

595
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,250
had a small fight.

596
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,390
But we got to see each other again like this!

597
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,730
- Elizabeth, give your greetings. - Hello.

598
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,670
Hi. I'll leave Yoo Na in your care.
She's my favorite friend.

599
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,570
You don't have to go so far
as to leave her in her care!

600
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:14,310
I actually firmly disciplined my Elizabeth.

601
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,980
"From now on, who's your BFF?" Yoo Na.

602
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,080
I mean, you know what they say,

603
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:26,020
people who become friends while
fighting become the best of friends. Right?

604
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,420
Didn't they say that? I thought they did...

605
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,960
Oh, it's so cold. Please go in.

606
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,560
It's gotten so cold here, right?

607
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,270
I'm Cha Dong Sik.

608
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:46,140
- He's currently under my care during his stay in
South Korea. I'm Lee Jong Gwang. - Oh I see, yes.

609
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,930
I'll be giving you the business
card of the branch office in Japan,

610
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,250
the one I'm most often present at.

611
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,750
Oh my, yes. It's nice to meet you.

612
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,560
- Yeah, Unni.
- Could you buy some figs on the way here?

613
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,400
- The house lady went grocery shopping and
forgot to buy that. - I'm already here, though.

614
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,770
Fine.

615
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,210
KJ Investment CompanyChief
Executive Officer Kim Jae Yi

616
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,730
Yes? This is KJ Investment's
branch office in Japan.

617
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,590
This is CEO Kim Jae Yi's secretary's office.

618
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,390
- H-Hello? - Yes, please speak.

619
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,860
Oh, you can speak Korean.

620
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,490
Is CEO Kim Jae Yi there right now?

621
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,300
Our CEO is currently in South Korea due to
personal schedules. What is it you needed?

622
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,270
Oh, it's nothing! I'll call back again.

623
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,010
Ajumma! It's all done, right?
It's all delicious, right?

624
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,580
I thought the food we usually eat would
be best, so I did it just the same.

625
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:06,180
You did great! They aren't the crowd
to be starving because they're poor.

626
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:10,260
That's why the point for today is "care"! Care.

627
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,530
No no! I'll bring it out.

628
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,470
I wonder, there isn't much
value concerning scarcity there.

629
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:29,410
I think a place like Manhattan, where they can't
expand on any buildings or property, is better.

630
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,940
People often find land hard to approach,

631
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,250
but when you look at it from a standard
of scarcity value, it becomes clear.

632
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,920
The truth is, we have a lot of interest in land, too.

633
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,890
Let's keep today as a light
meal, just for greetings.

634
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,790
The detailed issues can be when we've
gotten to know each other better.

635
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,960
Oh! Of course, I'm always getting ahead of myself.

636
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,370
But the two of you are quite the pair! I'm
wondering when you're planning to get married?

637
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,440
We'll be holding one (a wedding) soon.
Early next year, near Dubai or Europe.

638
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,450
Oh my gosh, I see!

639
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,380
You're so lucky!

640
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:18,290
Oh right! Please try the spicy steamed flatfish!

641
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:21,260
Oh, and this radish salad has raw
oysters that came straight

642
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,000
from Tong Yeong City this morning!

643
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,330
Yes and...

644
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:31,840
Oh, this one! This one has minced fish cake mixed
in with some salted pollock roe as seasoning.

645
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,540
The recipe's a bit peculiar,
but I'm sure it'll be delicious.

646
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,780
It really is delicious.

647
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,350
Its taste is similar to the
ones my mother used to make.

648
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:49,990
Oh my, is that so!? How fortunate!

649
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,560
Ajumoni! Please give us some more egg rolls!

650
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,290
Of course.

651
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,480
- Please enjoy. - Thank you.

652
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,170
Huh?! Huh!? Dammit!

653
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,640
- Tae Oh? - Y-Yeah, Noona.

654
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,070
What are you doing here?

655
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,710
- What about you? - Me? This is my home.

656
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,650
Right. I'm here because it's your house too.

657
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,320
You came here knowing this is my home?

658
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,450
Yeah... I-I have something to tell you.

659
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,220
Oh but I'm not sure I can, I have some guests at home.

660
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,590
What? Is it urgent?

661
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,660
What is it? I have to get in there right now—

662
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,070
I love you!

663
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,110
When did it start?

664
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:21,380
Fine, you're right.
Love isn't something you start like,

665
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,920
"Okay, I'm gonna start now. Beep!" right?

666
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,220
Still, you know exactly what kind
of relationship Joon Jae and I have.

667
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,730
Just thinking of Joon Jae...

668
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,230
How could you love me?

669
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,240
You dummy, raise your head.

670
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,950
Is love a crime?

671
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:01,090
Oh my gosh, look at how thin you've become!
How could that be?

672
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,290
Do you think you'll be able
to pull yourself together?

673
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:11,630
Do you think I can go now?

674
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,030
What do I do with you?!

675
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,870
Joon Jae is the only one for me.

676
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,540
This is heartbreaking, seriously.

677
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,110
I mean, when in the world did
your love for me start growing?

678
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:31,080
The truth is, it isn't like I didn't
notice it before.[New Message: To: Nam Doo]

679
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,520
But why'd it have to be me of all people...[New
Message: Nam Doo: Get out right now.]

680
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,990
Then again, the only person that's
okay around you is probably me.

681
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,220
[To Nam D: Get out right now.
That place is Cha Si Ah's house.]

682
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,830
There were times I got the
general gist of it.

683
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:47,170
You must be in so much pain. Are you okay?

684
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,970
It's rare for two beautiful people to meet each
other but the two of you are just...right?

685
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,540
You're right.

686
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,640
Get out right now. That place is Cha Si Ah's house.

687
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,850
Excuse me, sir.

688
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,560
I'm so sorry. An urgent matter has come up.
I think we need to leave right away.

689
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,360
Oh my, already? Did we make a-a mistake?

690
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,170
No, it's n-nothing like that.
We'll give you a call later.

691
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:25,970
No, I don't think you can leave like this!
We still have so much we need to talk about!

692
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,410
Oh my, CEO Kim!

693
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,460
Wow. How in the world did that happen?

694
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,960
That's what I'm saying. You should've
been thorough with the background check!

695
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,060
What the hell is this!?
We were so close to getting in trouble!

696
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,440
Family registrations
don't even show sisters-in-law.

697
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,740
How the hell was I supposed to know?!

698
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,730
You think I saw things getting
screwed up like this?!

699
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,940
Hey, one wrong move and
everything would've been busted.

700
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,180
What got busted?

701
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,240
It's nothing.

702
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:11,220
What almost got busted?
Why were you close to getting in trouble?

703
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,790
Heo Joon Jae, are you a con artist?
A terrible bastard?

704
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,530
I'm different too.

705
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,740
Heo Joon Jae will probably dislike me
too, if he realizes I'm different.

706
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,840
He will soon leave.

707
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:42,310
If you work, different kinds
of things could happen.

708
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:46,420
Why are you not talking and just staring?
It's scary.

709
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,760
Was it all a lie?

710
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,830
That's right. I'm a person who lies.

711
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:00,030
I deceive people and make money off of them.

712
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:05,070
Right, I'm that kind of person.

713
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,370
What are you saying?

714
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,470
That is my secret.

715
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,240
- Hey, Heo Joon Jae! - What is your secret?

716
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,280
My secret is...

717
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:35,470
that I am different from you. That I am a mermaid.

718
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:50,380
Why are you having a staring
contest and not talking?

719
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,950
Hey, let's go. Let's rest today.

720
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:58,160
If you know who I am, you will be shocked.
You will be hurt and scared.

721
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,760
You will leave me, that's why I am
trying my very best not to be caught.

722
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:11,040
Huh? Cheong, Joon Jae, let's go in.
Both of you are really sensitive.

723
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:26,820
Hyung. Just now... did you hear what she just said?

724
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,520
What? The one where you almost got caught?

725
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,290
The one "why we were almost in trouble?"

726
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:33,460
Not that.

727
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,160
Aside from that, what should I hear?

728
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,130
You need to talk, what should I hear when you're
not opening your mouths and are just staring?

729
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:25,640
My secret is that I am different from you.

730
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,750
That I... am a mermaid.

731
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,220
I was looking at the painting on the vase

732
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,690
and it may sound like crazy talk, but

733
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:46,000
thoughts of that man in the
painting being me come to mind.

734
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,030
Where did she go again?

735
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,170
Everything repeats itself.

736
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:31,910
My Lord, have you heard about the mermaid?

737
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:38,950
Kim Dam Ryeong. He was a town head of Heuppgok.

738
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:43,090
To celebrate the first day of the new town head,

739
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:47,990
I plan on presenting a rare spectacle.

740
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:54,370
I dream. In that dream,
I am living in a strange world.

741
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:58,900
And also, you are there.

742
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,570
Look at this. The clothes that the man is wearing.

743
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:07,210
It seems like clothes nowadays. As if it's
a painting while looking at the future.

744
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:13,750
And on top of that, a mermaid. Isn't it mysterious?

745
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:22,490
♬ If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon ♬

746
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:25,100
Everything repeats itself.

747
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:29,230
The fate in this world is
continuing in that world.

748
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,540
It's the same way with ill-fate.

749
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:38,310
Protect that woman against
the dangerous person.

750
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,520
A long time ago, a young lad loved a mermaid.

751
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:52,820
He heard the mermaid's voice.

752
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,590
Save me.

753
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,960
I'm also different. Heo Joon Jae.

754
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,930
If he realizes that I'm different

755
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:05,200
Heo Joon Jae will hate me. He will leave.

756
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,540
Don't come, Heo Joon Jae!

757
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,510
But he didn't know an important thing.

758
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:16,880
Mermaids have a special ability.

759
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,060
Through a kiss, she can erase
herself in the memory of a human.

760
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:30,830
That way, the mermaid disappeared
like foam in the young lad's memory.

761
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:39,300
♬ If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon ♬

762
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:47,080
What are you? Why are you still here?

763
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:55,250
♬ I am afraid being under the same sky ♬

764
00:57:55,250 --> 00:58:02,930
♬ together with you will be erased. ♬

765
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:14,070
♬ If we can walk as far as the blue sea's horizon ♬

766
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:19,680
♬ I won't let go of your hand. ♬

767
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,350
I love you.

768
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:43,740
♬ You are someone I want
within my reach to the end ♬

769
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,740
♬ Until the last moment of my life ♬

770
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:56,010
♬ Somewhere and sometime, as I met and loved you ♬

771
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:03,790
♬  If I see you like someone
receding in the distance ♬

772
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:09,700
