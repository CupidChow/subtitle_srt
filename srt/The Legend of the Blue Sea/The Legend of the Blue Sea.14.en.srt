1
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,860
Joon Jae.

2
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,310
I couldn't protect her.

3
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,650
In the end...

4
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,090
because of me...

5
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,230
Because I

6
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,140
could not protect her...

7
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,520
Will you be able to remember this story?

8
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,990
I promise.

9
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,760
Even after I am reborn, I will look
for you, search for you, meet you,

10
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,500
love you, and protect you.

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
I will remember for sure.

12
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,630
After saying that,

13
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,340
after promising like that,

14
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,650
I forgot all about it.

15
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,120
Even though she was reborn and searched for me,

16
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,220
met me, and loved me,

17
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,890
I couldn't remember anything.

18
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,260
I only made her cry.

19
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,740
I could not

20
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,740
protect any of it.

21
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,730
Department of Neuropsychiatry
Professor Jin Gyeong Won

22
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,980
That guy was 27 years old.

23
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,350
He was the same age as me now.
The girl was trapped in the net.

24
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,660
The guy died while trying to save her.

25
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,360
And the girl stabbed herself with
the harpoon that stabbed the guy,

26
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,070
and died together with him. That is...

27
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,900
That's their last story.

28
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,540
It is a sad fate.

29
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,840
Why were we reborn,

30
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,280
and why did we meet again?

31
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,820
For someone to be reborn, wouldn't that mean that
there's a dream that hasn't been fulfilled yet?

32
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,060
That dream could be an unfulfilled love,

33
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,760
or it could be an unappeased greed.

34
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,900
Why would an ill-fate repeat?

35
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,340
Out of those two, which is the real ill-fate?

36
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,610
Is it the fate of you and the
one who is trying to harm you,

37
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,080
or is it the fate of you and the one you love?

38
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,420
If you didn't love her,

39
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,230
and if she didn't love you,

40
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,660
then there wouldn't have
been such a tragic ending.

41
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,040
Your love for each other
ended up killing each other.

42
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,970
Is there a worse fate than that?

43
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,380
Do you think all this will repeat?

44
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:38,080
If you stop right here and send her
back to where she originally came from,

45
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,790
wouldn't you be able to avoid the tragic ending?

46
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,290
No.

47
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,130
The fact that everything has repeated
is not a curse, but an opportunity.

48
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,570
An opportunity to change the ending.

49
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,830
Do you believe you can change fate?

50
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,970
There must be a reason to
have remembered everything.

51
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,400
This time... I will protect her.

52
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,380
I will protect her for sure.

53
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,260
The Legend of the Blue Sea

54
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Episode 14

55
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,260
Where is Cheong?

56
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,600
Ah! You startled me!

57
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,630
I said, where is she?!

58
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,500
I don't know. She went out a while ago.
I'm sure she is nearby.

59
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,410
Wow, when a guy gets blinded by a
girl, he becomes like that.

60
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,040
He was totally normal before.

61
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,200
Heo Joon Jae, did you have a scary dream?

62
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,730
The scary dream...

63
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,000
Now I'm done with that. I won't dream it anymore.

64
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,690
- Is there anything you'd like to do?  - Hmm?

65
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,360
Things you want to do. Let's do them all.

66
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,800
- All of them?- Yes, all of them.

67
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,740
Heo Joon Jae, then should we enjoy
some empty formalities and vanity?

68
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,900
What?

69
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,840
Actually, there are three levels of love:
romantic love, hot love, and dirty love.

70
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,010
What we are trying to do is romantic love.

71
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,910
What's romantic love?

72
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,250
Well, it's like vain formalities.

73
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,400
Drink tea, watch movies, have meals together,

74
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,590
plan a special event,
confess love, things like that.

75
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,360
But all these are moving towards dirty love.

76
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,290
- Dirty? - Yes, dirty love.

77
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,930
I am also very curious about it, but I was
told that is reserved only for the experts.

78
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,200
She said that if we carelessly approach it,
it could end in a nasty way.

79
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,300
So, we have to be careful.

80
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,670
So, we should enjoy vain formalities first.

81
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,940
Okay, let's do that.

82
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,310
What others do, let's do them all.

83
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,280
You know,

84
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm just saying this,

85
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,720
- so don't think too much about
it, and answer me quickly.- Yeah.

86
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,960
The man saves the woman then dies in
the movie we saw earlier, you know?

87
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,530
- Yeah, he did. - I mean, there's no way that would happen,

88
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,430
but if I died like that, what would you do?

89
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,370
I'd follow you.

90
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,110
Hey! What do you mean you'd follow me?! Are you crazy?!

91
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,240
And you need to give it some
thought before you respond.

92
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,380
You told me to answer right
away without thinking.

93
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,810
But still, who answers

94
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,750
as if they were being asked
to go to the grocery store?

95
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,050
If you live, I have to live with you
and if you die, I have to die with you.

96
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,590
Are you stupid?

97
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,100
Then what becomes of the man's death?
The man died to save the woman.

98
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,530
The man says that at the end,
"Please listen to my request."

99
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,740
"Promise that you'll live on
and that you won't give up."

100
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,040
"Live until the end,
find a good person and grow old, happily."

101
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,410
Would you do that?

102
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,020
If I'm not in this world, would you meet
another good person and grow old happily?

103
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,620
Yeah.

104
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,360
Of course, I would do that.

105
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,860
You would certainly do that?

106
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,800
So you do the same.

107
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,400
If, really if,

108
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,940
something happens to me,

109
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,980
you live on well.

110
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,950
Don't give up.

111
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,420
Good things, pretty things.

112
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,990
Have them all.

113
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,620
What's going on, Heo Joon Jae?

114
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,560
You said you were just saying this,
but what's with this serious tone?

115
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,200
Is something really going to happen to you?

116
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,300
I told you it was just "if."

117
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,540
Promise me.

118
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,980
If anything happens,
you won't think any weird thoughts.

119
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,810
Promise that until the end,

120
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,050
you'll live well.

121
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,290
- I can't.  - Why?

122
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,960
It feels like if I make the promise,
something bad like that will happen.

123
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,730
So I said "if."

124
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,730
What if or what not, I don't like it!

125
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,400
So?

126
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,340
- You're not going to promise me? - No.

127
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,370
- You really won't? - I'm not going to!

128
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,420
Are you not going to hold my hand now?

129
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,430
Are you not going to talk to me?

130
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,500
- Promise me.  - Are you talking about that again?

131
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,000
I told you I wouldn't. Why do I
need to make that kind of promise?

132
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,740
Don't talk to me. I won't talk to you either.

133
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,290
Tae Oh, see me for a second.

134
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,760
What's wrong with the atmosphere
between you two? Did you fight?

135
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,630
- He keeps saying weird stuff! - What weird stuff?

136
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,470
Like saying that if something happens
to him, to live on well on my own.

137
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,000
- Huh? - It's weird, isn't it?

138
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,380
- Why? - It's come.

139
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,750
- What has come? - He grew tired of it.

140
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,420
The valid period of love is three months.
It's been three months for you guys.

141
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,350
You need to overcome this well, or it's a KTX
(express train) headed towards your breakup.

142
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,020
Heo Joon Jae is not that kind of person.

143
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,850
Heo Joon Jae is especially that kind of person.

144
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,360
I've known him for ten years, and he hasn't had
a girlfriend for more than three months.

145
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,960
They all break up before then.

146
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,030
That's right.

147
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,500
Hey!

148
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,370
Adjust the home security
to the maximum setting.

149
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,510
Connect a line so I can monitor
any space within 100m at any time.

150
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,320
When it detects any break-ins from
outside, make it alert me right away.

151
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,520
Is it because of Ma Dae Young?

152
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,000
Hello, Doctor.

153
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,870
Ma Dae Young?

154
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,880
It's been a while.

155
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,040
It's been nine months, Doctor.

156
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,020
Heo Joon Jae came here, didn't he?

157
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,590
Don't think about lying because I saw it all.

158
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,060
Let me do what Heo Joon Jae did.

159
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,170
It seems like he saw his end,
and I want to see mine too.

160
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,800
I think I need to know my end.

161
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,470
So I can know why my life turned out the way it is.

162
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,880
From the moment I was born,

163
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,110
I always thought that I was being punished.

164
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,750
I wanted to ask

165
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,390
why my life turned out like that.

166
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,090
I don't know why,

167
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,030
but I think the answer lies in that life.

168
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,750
It wasn't me.

169
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,520
It wasn't me.

170
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,390
Then who was it?

171
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,660
Who killed them?

172
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,910
You probably heard it already. Going forward,
I will be the final approving authority.

173
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,940
I will personally lead the
investors' meetings as well.

174
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,810
Is Chairman Heo very ill?

175
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,580
There are outsiders asking.

176
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,920
No, he has gone on a trip to relax and recuperate.

177
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,360
Even after he returns,
he wants to step back from the workforce.

178
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,090
If you have anything to tell him, you can tell me.

179
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,000
But there are still things that
need to be reported directly to him.

180
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,200
Why?

181
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,580
Are you afraid that I'll take out or
add in the middle? Can you not trust me?

182
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,510
That's not it.

183
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:28,120
If you are on my father's
side and cannot work under me,

184
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,490
you can leave now.

185
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,900
I'll take that as no one.

186
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,500
Can we start the meeting?

187
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,020
Father.

188
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,290
I met with the doctor,
and he said the results are good.

189
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,880
Stay here for a few more days and then

190
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,730
return home and receive
regular outpatient treatment.

191
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,160
My eyes are worsening as time passes.

192
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,730
It's a big problem.

193
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,740
Oh, but because you just had
surgery for a hemorrhage,

194
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,440
it's difficult to perform surgery for your eyes.

195
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,980
- For now, take your medication and just be
careful not to worsen the condition. - Okay.

196
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,280
Chi Hyeon.

197
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,950
Yes, Father.

198
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,520
You can contact Joon Jae, right?

199
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,030
Of course.

200
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,800
Ah, as soon as you fell, I contacted him.

201
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,500
- You did? - Yes.

202
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,710
It looks like he's busy.

203
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,980
I'm sure he'll come by soon.

204
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,110
I'll contact him again.

205
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,250
Okay.

206
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,740
Petty guy!

207
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,380
Narrow-minded one! He is pouting
over that thing and won't talk to me?

208
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,780
I must've been blinded by love. I was naive then.

209
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,650
I lived in water all my life and came to the
land for the first time. So, what do I know?

210
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,660
The only guy that I happened to meet was that
Heo Joon Jae. So I thought he was the best.

211
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,890
If Seoul was far away, he should have told me that.

212
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,360
He flew on a plane. But just for him,
it took me three months and ten days

213
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,370
to swim all the way here and I thought
my coccyx was about to fall off!

214
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,070
Why is he asking me to make that
kind of nonsensical promise?

215
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,910
Stop it already!

216
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,640
Huh? What?

217
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,540
I told you to stop it.
You are cussing me out inside right now.

218
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,950
Heol! How did he know?

219
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,380
He sure has a keen sense of what's going on.

220
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,240
I thought Heo Joon Jae was
the only good looking guy in the world,

221
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,220
but there are plethora of them on TV.

222
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,720
Does he think he is the only one who is handsome?

223
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,560
He has the prince syndrome and
thinks everyone is attracted to him!

224
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,660
- Hey!  - What?!

225
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,400
Ah, jeez! Stop it already.
If it's not meant to be, just break up.

226
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,770
Don't go out anywhere and just stay home.

227
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,170
I don't want to. I have an appointment.

228
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,610
Whom are you meeting?

229
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,980
See? You can't even tell me.

230
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,080
That's right. It has to be fair.

231
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,850
Then, you go with her, Hyung.

232
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,780
Why should I follow her?

233
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,190
I don't want to. It's my appointment.
I don't need anyone.

234
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,020
Fine! Do whatever you want.

235
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,970
Good job, Cheong! He was hanging out with
a "Mi-mi," and he is about to become one.

236
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,930
What's "Mi-mi"?

237
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,170
Crazy Misery! Those who are into things
like obsessiveness and confinement.

238
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,270
But I don't mind things like
obsessiveness and confinement.

239
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,410
Well, I sort of like it.

240
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,780
Because you are like this,
he is getting tired of it.

241
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,210
Harden your heart and go strongly at it!

242
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,860
Ahjussi, I'm sorry for not
coming to visit you often.

243
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,360
I have a lot going on these days.

244
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,400
Can I tell you a story that no one could believe?

245
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:46,980
A very long time ago, you were a good
friend of mine and were always on my side.

246
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:53,990
This time, you were born a bit earlier
and stood by me even when I was young.

247
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,190
Now, whoever made you like this,

248
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,330
I will find him.

249
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,600
If it's this person, blink twice.

250
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:28,920
Do you think there is possibly someone
around you who is related to Ma Dae Young?

251
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,760
Joon Jae.

252
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:48,010
I was really drunk last time. You must have
been startled after receiving the call.

253
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,880
Saying that you will protect your mother,

254
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,550
so protect my father, was also
something you said because you were drunk?

255
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,380
Oh, did I say that? I must have been really drunk.

256
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,250
What about father's health being bad?

257
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,120
Oh, he is better now.

258
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:11,600
Hey, our father gave all the work to
me and went on a trip with his friends.

259
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,710
Also, you will know this sooner or later...

260
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,110
Father got his will notarized.

261
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:30,520
He left almost all his assets to me and Mother.

262
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,820
I told him to reconsider several times.

263
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,460
After meeting you the last time,
he must have been heartbroken.

264
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,360
Were you always such a friendly guy?

265
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,900
I will hate my father on my own.

266
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,310
You don't need to encourage me to hate him.

267
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,610
If you keep doing this, it looks
like you have some ulterior motive.

268
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,720
What about Cheong?

269
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,820
Is she well?

270
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,260
Why would you ask that?

271
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,630
That's right. I think of her time to time.
I wonder if she is doing well.

272
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,360
Send my greetings to her.

273
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,270
Why should I?

274
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,610
Forget it, if you don't want to.

275
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,890
Oh, no. I don't know what to do!

276
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:54,600
Joon Jae, it turns out that the
ajumoni at our house is your moth—

277
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,380
What brings you in here?

278
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:09,680
I heard you are sick. You couldn't even
go to work. Try eating some porridge.

279
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,290
Oh, I got sick uselessly to make you do extra work.

280
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,660
What shall I do?

281
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,530
Oh, it's okay. Call me after you
are done so I can take it away.

282
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:26,200
Omo! It's not like I don't have hands
or feet. Who would I dare to call?

283
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,040
After I'm done, I will clean it up myself.
Please do not mind me at all.

284
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,610
Alright, then.

285
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,380
Why are you doing this, Ji Young's aunt?!

286
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,980
I wanted to do this just once.

287
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,760
I am sorry, but I feel a bit uncomfortable.

288
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,190
I am sorry.

289
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,310
- Madam, Ji Young's aunt seems very sick.
- Really?

290
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,440
You know, she is not her normal self.
She's a bit strange.

291
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,810
She was never normal anyway.

292
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,750
The number you have called—

293
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,620
Ah, Kang Seo Hee, this woman!
She is ignoring my call again!

294
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,550
Ha! Seriously!

295
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,560
Excuse me.

296
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,630
Yes?

297
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,900
Their son...

298
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,470
Son? Chairman Heo's real son?

299
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,740
Yes, do you know something about that son?

300
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,540
Why are you curious about that, Ajumma?

301
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
Just because...

302
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,410
The son who's taking care of
all of CEO Heo's business is

303
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,120
the son who was brought in by Kang Seo Hee.

304
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,520
His biological son ran out of the house
ten years ago, and no one knows where he is.

305
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,260
He ran out of the house?

306
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,630
He didn't go to study overseas?

307
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:07,130
Study overseas? I don't think so. I clearly heard
that he ran away when he was in high school.

308
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,540
At that rate, if Kang Seo Hee's
son receives all the inheritance,

309
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,910
only the strangers will be
benefiting from his household.

310
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,610
Chairman Heo is not that bright.

311
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,710
What kind of father is he?

312
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,680
Why would he abandon his own son and
dedicate himself to someone else's son?

313
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,750
Ah, seriously. No matter how much he is
head over heels over a woman, how could he?

314
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,970
Ajumma, what's the matter?

315
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,270
Excuse me. I need to go somewhere.

316
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:47,710
But it's time for children to come back from
school. You need to prepare their snack.

317
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,140
Please go, Mother-jumoni.

318
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,750
I will take care of the children, Unni.

319
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:00,020
I will prepare kids' snacks and
take them to after school academies.

320
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,320
That ajumma! Is she just doing whatever
she wants because she is quitting or what?!

321
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,530
Unni, please!

322
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,900
She must have something to take care of.

323
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,630
Also, how can you call her "ajumma," seriously?!

324
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,170
I should call an ajumma, ajumma.
What else should I call her then?

325
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,670
Who calls household helpers ajumma these days?

326
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,040
The going trend is, "Mother/Mother-in-Law."

327
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,790
Auntie,

328
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,520
the age different between that ajumma and
I is not that great for me to call her "Mother."

329
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,550
- What's with "Mother"?  - "Mother" is nothing more than

330
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,190
sharing the same meal and
sleeping under the same roof.

331
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,330
She prepares my meals and even does my laundry.

332
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,130
I've even let Mother wash my underwear!

333
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,640
Oh, I'm going nuts!

334
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,780
Chi Hyeon, go in first. Greet your father well.

335
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,340
Yes.

336
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,380
Are you leaving now? I came late
on purpose, to come after you left.

337
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,050
Are you happy?

338
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:46,260
I'm sorry. Even though you may not
believe me, I didn't do it on purpose.

339
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh, really? I believe you. I need to believe it.

340
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,770
You have to raise my Joon Jae now. I am hoping
that you are a good person more than anyone else.

341
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,720
That's right. I'm sure my husband told you already,

342
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,210
but please don't show up until our
Joon Jae becomes an adult.

343
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,320
That way he can grow
accustomed to the new family.

344
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,390
Don't worry. I will raise and
love him more than my own son.

345
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,170
- Who? - She says she is Mo Yoo Ran.

346
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,780
How dare she come here?

347
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,650
Open it.

348
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:02,730
Oh, my! How long has it been?

349
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,640
Have a seat.

350
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,840
What would you like to drink?

351
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,740
Ajumma, please excuse us for a while.

352
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,880
Are you going to stand up and talk? Have a seat.

353
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,290
Where is my Joon Jae?

354
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,960
Where is he?

355
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,160
- Why are you asking me about
your son? He is your son.  - What?

356
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,290
It looks like you came knowing that
your son isn't in our house.

357
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,500
Why are you asking me about him?

358
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,340
I've never kicked him out. He went out on his own.

359
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,210
And my husband didn't really try to look
for him, so that's why it came to this.

360
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,580
Oh, this is what it's all about?

361
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,980
I thought you two were keeping in
touch, but I guess not.

362
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,950
You said you'd raise him well.

363
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,130
I was planning to, but what can I do since he left?

364
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,660
Is this why you didn't allow us to meet?

365
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:10,940
To make my son yours, my husband yours,
and my position yours. Is that why?

366
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,470
You are really funny.

367
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,980
Hey! Don't pretend to be nice.

368
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,410
You just gave up.

369
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,890
If it were me, I would not have given up.
I would not have run away, leaving my son.

370
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,420
Just because I told you not to meet,
you really don't meet him? Are you stupid?

371
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,430
What?

372
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,830
If you aren't going to have some tea,
can you leave now? I'm really tired.

373
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,870
Kang Ji Yeon!

374
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,940
My name is Kang Seo Hee.

375
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,610
No, your name is Kang Ji Yeon.

376
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:58,050
My son. I will definitely find him and
bring him back to where he belongs.

377
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:03,190
You, too. I will take you back
to your original position.

378
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,070
Yes, it's me.

379
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,220
Miss Cheong.

380
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,830
All right! All right!

381
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,000
You should watch out for cars.

382
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,500
- Pay attention to oncoming cars. He
said not to be absent minded.  - Who did?

383
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:54,710
Someone that I like. We said we
would go grocery shopping together.

384
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,880
Oh, that's right. Did you wait for long?

385
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,110
That's okay. This is the only
appointment I have today.

386
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,060
I can't tell her to stay home all day long.

387
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,870
Trail her well, without being caught.

388
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,540
You! Don't let your ears turn red!

389
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,820
When the stem is dried out like
this, it's not fresh.

390
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,360
For fish, the gills need to be a
light pink color for it to be fresh.

391
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,260
These are not that fresh.

392
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,760
But it's not bad for buying it at the market.

393
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,230
I've never had fresh ones since I got here.

394
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,430
Where you are from must have a lot of
good fish. Did you live near the ocean?

395
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,970
Something like that.

396
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,840
You must miss it.

397
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,340
But there are a lot of good food here, so it's okay.

398
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,440
Should we have some ice
cream before heading back?

399
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,780
Yes, I was feeling really depressed,
but I feel better now that I met you.

400
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,410
Thanks!

401
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,660
What is this?

402
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,260
She said she has someone to meet.
Who's this ajumma?

403
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,550
She gets around and makes friends easily!

404
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:47,450
Here's the Ma Dae Young's
psychological medical treatment report.

405
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,030
Have you by any chance heard
of a woman named Kang Ji Yeon?

406
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,630
Kang Ji Yeon?

407
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,630
No. Why?

408
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,030
She is the only woman that's involved
with Ma Dae Young, but I can't find her.

409
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,940
Her resident registration got
cancelled due to unknown residency.

410
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,040
We are suspecting that they
had a child between them.

411
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,550
Then, they could still be helping him to run
away, whether it's the woman or the child.

412
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,080
That's possible.

413
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,880
Hand me that information, too.

414
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,290
Nam Do Hyung finds people
better than a typical cop.

415
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,620
Ah, geez!

416
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,790
How did I get entangled with this conman?

417
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,200
I will take responsibility,
so turn the boat.

418
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,110
Our Police Officer Hong is a much
nicer person that you'd expect.

419
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,650
This guy! Are you crazy?! Do I look like your friend?

420
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,620
Jin Gyeong Won

421
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,190
Jin Gyeong Won?

422
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,090
Do you know him?

423
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:04,230
Since 2009, he treated Ma Dae Young
most frequently every few months.

424
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,370
Jin Gyeong Won

425
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,700
Yes, he was my patient.

426
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,410
You know Ma Dae Young, Doctor?

427
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,980
Yes. He came occasionally and got treated.

428
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:24,150
He was suffering from anger control
disorder and extreme manic depression.

429
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,750
Has he come recently?

430
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,330
No.

431
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,500
He hasn't come lately.

432
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,680
It's here.

433
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,380
- Oh, you work here?- Yes.

434
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,150
This is Cha Si Ah's house?

435
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,890
You should have double
checked everything before!

436
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,450
What's this?! We almost got in big trouble!

437
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:05,260
We almost got caught!

438
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,890
They were like that because
it was Cha Si Ah's house.

439
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,160
Hmm? What was?

440
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,030
It's nothing. Here you go.

441
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,430
Bye then.

442
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,330
Bye.

443
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,750
Noona, that's not it.

444
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,820
What's not it?

445
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,450
Whatever you think, that's not it.

446
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,190
Where are you going?

447
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:44,300
You really have a serious symptom! What will
you do with the picture of my house door?

448
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,100
- Do you want to feel my presence
even to that extent? - I'm going nuts.

449
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,140
I'm going nuts, too!

450
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,410
My head is about to explode,
just with my own problems!

451
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,380
The crucial fact is that there
is no space for you in my heart.

452
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,780
It's okay not to have the space, really.

453
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,790
Was I too harsh?

454
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,890
Love is such a hassle.

455
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,470
Heo Joon Jae?

456
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,300
This is Heo Chi Hyeon. I'm near Joon Jae's house.

457
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,210
Cheong. Let me hold this for you.

458
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,210
Okay.

459
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,120
Please go ahead and go down first. I need
to ask the professor about something else.

460
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,220
Hurry up. I'm not your taxi.

461
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,990
Since it's cold, blast the heater on.

462
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,930
Alright.

463
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,700
It's my car. I'll take care of it on my own.

464
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,240
Department of Neuropsychiatry
Professor Jin Gyeong Won

465
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,290
He came yesterday. Ma Dae Young.

466
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,060
Why did he come?

467
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:22,790
If he doesn't take his medication,
he can't control his violent nature.

468
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,030
He is someone who killed Dam Ryeong and Se Hwa.

469
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,200
He is after us even here, too.

470
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,600
He also saw the end of himself yesterday,

471
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,570
and said this.

472
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:40,280
- It wasn't me. It was not me. - What?

473
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,290
He didn't kill? Then who?

474
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,690
He didn't tell me so I don't know, either.

475
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,230
I told you that. You can't change fate that easily.

476
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:08,540
Even now, send the person
back to where she belongs.

477
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,580
Would Ma Dae Young come back here?

478
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,450
I told him that I'd prepare the medicine.

479
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,520
He will come soon.

480
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,690
When he comes, can you contact me?

481
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,520
Sure.

482
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,860
I'm sorry. I lost Cheong.

483
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,470
- Hurry up!  - I'm on the way.

484
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,640
I just ignored the traffic light twice!

485
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,100
What will happen if she goes around
alone and meets Ma Dae Young?

486
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,640
You need to take full responsibility,
Officer Hong.

487
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,780
Why would I take that respons—

488
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,150
Ah, why is she not answering the phone?

489
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,620
Thank you.

490
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,390
Help yourself.

491
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,190
Is it "pour-eat" or "dip-eat"?

492
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,230
I'm talking about the sauce. Do I pour it or dip it?

493
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:43,470
Ah. "Pour-eat, dip-eat." As for me, "dip-eat."

494
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:49,110
I'm glad. I also prefer dip-eat, but since Heo Joon
Jae is a "pour-eat," we always fight when we eat.

495
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,380
How long have you lived with Joon Jae?

496
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,910
Three months.

497
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,180
Oh, three months. Just the two of you?

498
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,820
No, with Heo Joon Jae's friends.

499
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,560
That's a relief.

500
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,360
What's a relief?

501
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:11,260
Oh, nothing. Just this and that.

502
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,970
- Would you like some fried
dumplings as well?  - Yes, sure!

503
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,200
Ah, sure! Please give us some fried mandoo, too.

504
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,970
Sure.

505
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,060
Oh, Joon Jae!

506
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,200
- Is that yours? - No, it's Miss Cheong's.

507
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,880
Thanks for carrying it for her,
but you don't need to do that anymore.

508
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,310
- Bye.- Bye.

509
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,800
Heo Joon Jae, are you mad at me now?

510
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,310
You guys fought again? Why do you fight every day?

511
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,090
I met Heo Joon Jae's older brother today, and
that's why he's like that. Isn't that weird?

512
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,490
If a guy gets mad at a girl who met his family,

513
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,960
that means he has no intention of
continuing the relationship with her.

514
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,430
What? You met his older brother? How?

515
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,600
He came to have a meal with me.

516
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,570
I thought he wasn't keeping in touch
with any of his family members.

517
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,970
I've never been introduced to them, either.

518
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,170
You've been introduced?

519
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:35,070
Yes. The last, last, last time.

520
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,440
What's wrong?

521
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,340
Is it because it's been so long
since I've been in the water?

522
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,240
What should I do?

523
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,460
So no one will ever be able
to get through this, right?

524
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:31,900
Unless they get someone who is a better hacker
than me, they won't be able to get into our house.

525
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,970
Okay. That fine. Also, go out and stay out today.

526
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,700
Why? I don't have any plans.

527
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,440
Hyung, you get out, too.
Don't come back until the evening.

528
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,540
What should I do that?

529
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,610
This is my house. When the house
owner tells you to do so, you do it.

530
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:54,290
Wow, he is making us pitiful again. Where
could we go in this harsh winter weather?

531
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:59,560
Since you said you are not going to work,
it's so hard to even set up a meeting.

532
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,330
Okay. Well, then, today,

533
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:07,830
no one will come back home
until the evening, right?

534
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,700
Get out. Hurry! Out!

535
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,370
- I need to get changed! - Just come out.
- I'm going to get changed first.

536
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,610
Hurry and come out. I'll wait out there.

537
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:44,140
Until the evening, no one will come?

538
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:56,950
Aish, it's so cold and where is he telling me to go?

539
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,000
I was wondering what you were doing.

540
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,240
Are you not cold?
Why are you swimming during the winter?

541
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,800
What... What are you wearing? What's on your body?

542
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,940
Ah, you're going to do a part-time job
again wearing that in an aquarium. Aigoo!

543
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,380
Our Cheong is so funny!

544
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:38,780
For a moment, I thought you were
a merm— Hah! What am I saying?

545
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been
watching too much American drama.

546
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,390
It really looks like the real thing.
I'm thinking about something impossible...

547
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,030
Miss, where's your house?

548
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:54,100
My house is far away.

549
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,430
There are a lot of things like this at my house.

550
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,970
That female patient.
Her BT (body temperature) was 29 degrees.

551
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:00,310
Is it true that she regained her consciousness
with just one round of the defibrillator?

552
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,510
In just one week,

553
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:05,380
- this turned into this? - Does that make any sense?

554
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,750
Where'd you get this?

555
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,610
I worked hard to make this.

556
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,330
No way...

557
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,570
Can you give me the gown over there?

558
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,580
What is this? This— What?

559
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:52,660
This. What is this? Huh?

560
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,830
How... How did it change?

561
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,530
Wow, there really are things
like this in the world!

562
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:02,880
Wow! What the!

563
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,440
Do I need to report you to
some international topic news,

564
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,010
I mean FBI or something?

565
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,540
Are you going to tell Heo Joon Jae?

566
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,410
Tell him? Uh, I'm not sure.

567
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,420
After I see how you reply to my questions.

568
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,390
Don't come close.

569
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:25,190
So, when you go into the water,
you turn into what you were before,

570
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,060
and if you come out of the water, you grow legs?

571
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,430
Yeah.

572
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,430
Wow! I'm going crazy!

573
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:37,970
So, the pearl? The pearl from last time. Like how it
is in the fairy tales, it was made from your tears?

574
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,600
That's right.

575
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,340
Cry.

576
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,050
Cry. Let me see if it really turns into pearls.
It's because I'm fascinated right now.

577
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,690
Okay, well, you don't have to cry right
now. Let's slowly cry a lot from now on.

578
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,860
Wow! This is a jackpot!

579
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,000
Since I replied well, you're not
going to tell Heo Joon Jae, right?

580
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,600
Cheong! Mermaid Cheong!
Why should we keep this a secret?

581
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,170
This is an amazing thing!
We are sitting on a pile of money!

582
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,740
I don't like a pile of money!

583
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,150
I like it! What's the point of staying home?

584
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:25,020
Hey! Let's go to a place like Las Vegas together,

585
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:29,860
launch a mermaid show, and go on a world tour!

586
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,990
Are you saying you're going
to sell me off, Jo Nam Doo?

587
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:37,230
No! I'm recommending a job to you. It's hard
for a normal person to get a job these days.

588
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,870
Since it's me, I am not reporting
you to any national agencies,

589
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,740
and am going to look into
going overseas for work.

590
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,310
- Okay! - Okay?

591
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,740
Yeah.

592
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,340
Okay.

593
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,510
- You want to shake hands?- Yeah, let's shake hands.

594
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,050
It's not something contagious, right?

595
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,320
Okay, fine.

596
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,550
Jo Nam Doo, are you okay?

597
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:36,590
Were you swimming here?

598
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,320
Is it not cold in this winter?

599
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:52,970
If Heo Joon Jae also sees my real
self, would he act like Jo Nam Doo?

600
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:57,110
Since I was already caught, should I have
asked him first before erasing his memories?

601
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,410
Jo Nam Doo!

602
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:02,150
Are you not cold?
Why are you swimming during the winter?

603
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,650
What are you wearing?

604
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,860
Wanting to get a part-time... I... you... a mermaid!

605
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,220
Can I touch it?

606
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:11,990
Wow, I'm going crazy!

607
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,230
This is amazing!

608
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,430
Try crying. We are now sitting on a pile of money!

609
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,240
You know all of the truth, so you probably
can't see me the same way as before, right?

610
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,640
Of course not! To be honest, it's hard
to see you in the same way as before.

611
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,110
Would Heo Joon Jae also be like this?

612
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:33,550
He will be worse than me! If he sees
something like this, he will run away 100%!

613
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:35,680
Then I probably should never be caught.

614
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,980
But it's too late because I found out.

615
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,160
To be honest, I was questioning
whether or not it would work

616
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,990
since I've only done it once in the water.

617
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,230
But it works well outside of the water too.

618
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,830
What?

619
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,100
I'm sorry.

620
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,320
I'm going crazy.

621
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:23,800
You know that feeling. When you're about to
think of something, but it doesn't come out.

622
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,100
What should I do? Does he remember?

623
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:32,240
Something like seeing the lottery number
in your dreams and then not remembering it.

624
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,370
That frustration that makes you go crazy!

625
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,440
I erased it, but did it not erase well?

626
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,810
Wait! I think I remember something.

627
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:50,620
That... In this house's swimming pool...

628
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,260
Cheong...!

629
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,430
Ow, why did you hit me?

630
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,600
Eat instead of being loud.

631
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,940
Hey, look! Look at my toes.

632
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,410
I feel like my toenail is going
to fall off! But I don't remember!

633
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:14,310
How my foot became like this,
how my foot bumped into something!

634
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,980
I just can't remember anything!

635
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,580
- It's early dementia due to alcohol.  - Is that it?

636
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,090
So watch your drinking!

637
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,020
Ah, put it down.

638
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,960
I didn't want to live smearing poop on the wall.

639
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,900
How can I be like this already?

640
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,500
There are supposed to be three bad luck
events this year. Has it started already?

641
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,550
Until when are you going to be like this?

642
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:54,320
What?

643
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,760
You're not talking to me or
meeting my eyes or smiling.

644
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:04,130
Okay, then. Let me ask one more time.
If something happens to me...

645
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,300
It's the same even if you ask a hundred times.

646
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,170
If something happens to you, I can't live.

647
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,840
Yeah, so why?

648
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,540
That...

649
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,750
My heart can only beat if you love me.

650
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:28,420
My heart on land has a limited time.

651
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:35,360
If you leave me or leave this
world, my heartbeat stops.

652
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,800
Jung Hoon died because of that, too.

653
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,700
When a loved one leaves, the heart cools,

654
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,600
hardens, and stops.

655
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,410
Without you, I'll be like that.

656
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:54,410
Unless I return to the ocean, I'll probably die.

657
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,280
You're going to die?

658
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,490
What?

659
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:07,390
- What did you just say?  - What?

660
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:13,630
Say it again. What will stop, harden?
What will happen?

661
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,370
You hear my voice?

662
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,540
You said your heart will stop.

663
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,010
When did you start hearing it?

664
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,370
- You said you're going to die.
- When did you start hearing it?

665
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,180
Why are you going to die?!

666
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:28,850
♬ Seeing with you; Listening with you;♬

667
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,190
♬Breathing with you. Everything.♬

668
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:37,660
♬There's nothing to throw away. I'm so happy.♬

669
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:41,930
♬ I want to stop by your side. ♬

670
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:45,800
♬ Everything about you ♬

671
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,870
♬I cannot remember ♬

672
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:54,140
♬I am ♬

673
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,640
There is something I need to ask you.

674
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,910
Is that important to you now?

675
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,210
Did you look for Kang Ji Yeon?

676
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,710
I've never done a background
check that gave me such a chill.

677
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,620
You said you are going to quit your job.
How about my house?

678
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:06,150
You've gotten much better.

679
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,620
I'm going to do a birthday party at home.
Can you come?

680
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,250
I'll be there.

681
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,560
I have a good idea.

682
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,020
What are you talking about?

683
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,060
Let's do like this. Trust me and leave it up to me.
