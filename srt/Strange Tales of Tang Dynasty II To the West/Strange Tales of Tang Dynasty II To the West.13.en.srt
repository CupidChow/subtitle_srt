00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,110
You also took the path?

195
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,310
There's a big slope on the path.

196
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,660
Judging from your appearance,

197
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,990
I guess you didn't fall.

198
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,030
Uncle Fed.

199
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,050
Who hit you?

200
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,030
Is it the waiter just now?

201
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,360
Let me teach him a lesson for you.

202
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,290
No need. No need.

203
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,590
Didn't I just say

204
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,150
that there's a big slope?

205
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,710
The snow was heavy, and the road was slippery.

206
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,030
My horse and I slipped and fell.

207
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,330
The horse fell into a deep ditch.

208
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,480
It took me a long time

209
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,620
to climb up.

210
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,800
Then it became like this.

211
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,520

212
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,360
well-traveled and knowledgeable.

213
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,240
Seeing the snow was heavy,

214
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,030
he asked us to dismount and lead the horses.

215
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,700
The deep ditch you mentioned

216
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,580
may be caused by ground fissures.

217
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,740
Some of the deep ditches in the mountains

218
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,340
are hundreds of meters deep.

219
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,670
It's good that you're fine.

220
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,030
I'm very hard to kill.

221
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,820
God doesn't want me.

222

Let's go back

223
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,550
and take the main road.

224
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,240
Let's go.

225
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,550
You're full.

226
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,990
But we're still hungry.

227
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,510

228
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,990
Why are you in such a hurry

229
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,710
to leave?

230
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,170

231
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,190
I can't say what's strange about it.

232
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,070
It's just strange.

233
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,350
The Mo's Inn looks

234
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,400
quite new.

235
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,510
It doesn't seem like an old haunted inn.

236
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,500
Besides, the snow is too heavy.

237
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,940
Why don't we stay here?

238
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,790
But this place...

239
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,310
What?

240
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,510
You don't dare to stay

241
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,950
at this remote inn?

242
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,830
If Liu Shiba knew it,

243
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,670
he would definitely laugh at us.

244
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,870
Who is Liu Shiba?

245
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,250
I remember now.

246
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,470
You told me before

247
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,910
about the Gantang Post.

248
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,510
This place

249
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,230
is even weirder than the Gantang Post.

250
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,230
I...

251
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,550
You're really staying here?

252
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,980
It's weird.

Su Wuming, so you're

257
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,480
doing this for fun?

258
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,380
You're even less serious than me.

259

My Mo's Inn

264
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,030
isn't a place where ordinary people can stay.

If you want to go in and rest,

266

each one of you

267
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,400
needs to show your unique skills.

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,690
What kind of rule is it?

269
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,110
It's my inn.

270
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,390
I made the rule.

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,030

There was no such rule just now.

274
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,830
He's right.

275
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,750
The rule

276
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,030

There're already guests at my inn.

You're quite a few.

281
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,550
If you all stay

282

287
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,620

it depends on how capable you are.

Then I'll tell

327
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,750
the history of this place.

328
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,220
During the Six Dynasties period,

329
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,710
the great monk Master Moshi

330
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,670
built a temple

331
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,620
between Hanzhou and Chang'an.

332
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,150
During construction, he was threatened by the thieves who dug for gold and silver.

333
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,430
Master was unmoved

334
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,540
and remained focused.

335
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,740
Not only did he built the Vajra Temple,

336
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,790
he also translated many scriptures

337
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,190
that have been handed down from generation to generation.

338
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,120
And eventually,

339
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,080
he reformed those robbers.

340
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,920
I think this should be

341
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,740
the site of the Vajra Temple.

342
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,420
You're just guessing, aren't you?

343
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,170
No, I'm not.

344
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,990
In this season,

345
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,870
there still are green onions and chives

346
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,860
growing on the hillside outside.

347
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,970
In the heavy snow,

348
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,660
they still remain lush and green.

349
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,200
It can be said to be a marvel.

350
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,600
It's a sign that there're gold and silver under the mountain.

351
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,870
Just as the saying goes, if there're green onions on the mountain, there's silver under it;

352
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,860
If there're chives on the mountain, there's gold under it.

353
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,950
Moreover, in the ancient book

354
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,870
"Record of the Six Dynasties Lost Works" from the Sui Dynasty,

355
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,150
it was recorded

356
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,540
that there were green onions and chives

357
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,400
growing around the Vajra Temple.

358
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,350
I also saw a stone lantern

359
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,480
of the Six Dynasties

360
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,960
on the hillside a few miles away.

361
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,950
Although the inscription is blurred,

362
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,710
I think

363
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,350
the words should be "Turn a Robber into a Buddha."

364
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,930
Also,

365
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,390
this place is located

366
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,020
right between Hanzhou and Chang'an.

367
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,050
Everything fits.

368
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,680
Therefore, I deduce

369
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,900
that this is

370
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,750
the site of the Vajra Temple.

371
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,100
What I said

372
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,850
is unique skills.

373
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,150
You only talked.

374
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,470

375
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,040
Doesn't this count?

376
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,740
But if I don't let you in,

377
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,830
you'll definitely say I don't keep my word.

378
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,100
Fine.

379
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,670
Then I'll cut you some slack

380
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,690
and let you in.

381
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,210
But he

382
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,190
can only stay at the woodshed.

383
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,119
Why?

384
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,040
Because you ate the chicken and didn't pay for it.

385
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,510
Lu Lingfeng.

386
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,310
She's disrespectful

387
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,390
to your savior.

388
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,790
Drink more alcohol.

389
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,990
Once you're warm,

390
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,150
you won't feel cold

391
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,550
staying at the woodshed.

392
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,010
Lu Lingfeng.

393
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,650
Which side are you on?

394
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,650
I think Lu Lingfeng is right.

395
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,300
If you stay at the woodshed alone,

396
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,740
you can drink as much as you want.

397
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,880
No one will say you drink too much.

398
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Isn't that great?

399
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,830
I'm not staying at the woodshed.

400
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,760
I want to stay at the superior room.

401
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,630
One scholar.

402
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,850
Two merchants.

403
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,590
One of them is Sogdian.

404
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,920
He does either spice business

405
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,310
or jewelry business.

406
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,150
As for the other one...

407
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,910
He's either a hero

408
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,020
or an assassin.

409
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,510
Stop looking.

410
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,390
They're all here to take shelter from the heavy snow.

411
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,030
Follow me.

412
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,110
How is it?

413
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,990
The superior room is nice, isn't it?

414
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,320
I have to tell you first.

415
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,260
It's not cheap.

416
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,520
It's understandable that it's a bit expensive.

417
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,270
After all, the heavy snow blocked the mountain.

418
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,110
We're in the middle of nowhere.

419
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,270
500 coins per person for each of the four of you.

420
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,990
150 coins for the one staying at the woodshed.

421
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,390
500 coins for the four horses.

422
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,060
1,000 coins for your food and drink.

423
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,640
The total is

424
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,350
3,650 coins.

425
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,220
This...

426
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,230
So expensive?

427
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,470
That's the price.

428
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,330
If you're not staying, leave now.

429
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,050
Mr. Lu.

430
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,990
We can't be taken advantage of

431
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,580
and be tricked.

432
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,110
Let's go.

433
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,910
Let's go.

434
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,160
Let's go.

435
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,950
Wait.

436
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,430
Xijun.

437
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,990
She's charging an unreasonable price.

438
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,050
We're not staying.

439
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:24,900
Landlady.

440
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,720
Your price is too high.

441
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,630
If it weren't for the strong winds and heavy snow,

442
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,890
we definitely wouldn't let you succeed.

443
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,450
Here are five silver ingots.

444
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,510
Give me the change tomorrow morning.

445
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,190
But we want two superior rooms.

446
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,270
The food must be good.

447
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,000
And the alcohol must be enough.

448
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,670
Okay.

449
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,510
The superior room next door is also for you.

450
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,500
How to arrange rooms

451
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,470
is up to you.

452
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,510
But he

453
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,360
must stay at the woodshed.

454
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,670
You...

455
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,710
You know that this is a clip joint.

456
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,270
Why do you insist on staying here?

457
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,000
Lu Lingfeng.

458
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,150
He's doing it for fun.

459
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,680
What are you doing this for?

460
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,230
You've been delayed in Shiyang

461
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,490
for more than ten days.

462
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,790
Aren't you in a hurry to take office

463
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,550
in Yunding?

464
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,140
And you, Xijun.

465
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,160
Five people and four horses.

466
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,630
She charged too much money.

467
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,630
You just paid her?

468
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,370
It's indeed too expensive.

469
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,620
Chicken Fed.

470
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,070
Didn't you see?

471
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,470
They

472
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,630
think there's something wrong with this inn

473
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,760
and want to find out.

474
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,410
They said earlier that they were leaving, but that wasn't their true intention.

475
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,750
Xijun, you also learnt smokescreens.

476
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,190
What you did just now was to avoid

477
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,520
arousing the suspicion

478
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,870
of that landlady?

479
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,680
Exactly.

480
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,990
If this is really a clip joint,

481
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,350
those people downstairs

482
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,010
should all be on the same side.

483
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,750
Otherwise, with just the landlady

484
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,880
and that old waiter,

485
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,150
she wouldn't have dared to let us

486
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,280
stay here together.

487
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,820
-That old waiter...
-That old waiter...

488
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,670
You go first.

489
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,160
Just now, I intentionally

490
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,450
weighed the weapon he used in my hand.

491
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,920
It's a little heavy.

492
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,200
It's just a stick.

493
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,670
But when he used it...

494
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,350
I once patrolled the frontier with my master.

495
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,150
The posture he used when he moved

496
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,550
looks quite familiar.

497
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,220
What are you talking about?

498
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,750
Wait.

499
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,990
Nothing's wrong.

500
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,120
You can drink it now.

501
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,740
What did you put in just now?

502
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,790
Yong'an Pill.

503
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,950
It can test for not only poison

504
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,950
but also roofies.

505
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,870
If something is put in the water,

506
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,090
when Yong'an Pill is added,

507
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,290
bubbles will appear.

508
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,040
Yingtao.

509
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,670
Impressive.

510
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,630
It's just a petty trick.

511
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,470
Petty tricks can sometimes be of great use.

512
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,790
This kind of inn built in the remote area

513
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,030
usually has wing-rooms on both sides of the courtyard

514
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,570
and a main room in the middle.

515
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,570
How come there's an ancestral hall?

516
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,790
And it's so ancient too.

517
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,460
It's not only ancient.

518
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,830
The construction method of this ancestral hall

519
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,990
is also completely different from the other buildings.

520
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,330
As soon as I entered the courtyard,

521
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,150
I found that this ancestral hall

522
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,440
must have some history.

523
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,750
It seems familiar to me,

524
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,760
but I can't remember

525
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,220
where I've seen it before.

526
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,630
On my way here,

527
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,390
I encountered a snow pit.

528
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,760
That was too dangerous.

529
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
Many horses and goods

530
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,670
fell into it.

531
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,280
When I looked down,

532
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,960
there were many corpses

533
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,310
in it.

534
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,070
Luckily,

535
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,880
someone next to me pulled me up.

536
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,080
That's why I'm fine.

537
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,760
Landlady.

538
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,090
I'm coming.

539
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,830
Another one came.

540
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,510
I'd like to see

541
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,430
what unique skill he has.

542
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,750
I'm Hermit Jiang.

543
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,800
It's been snowing heavily.

544
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,000
I'd like to stay here.

545
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,830
Landlady,

546
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,570
please do me a favor.

547
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,050
Then please go in.

548
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,930
Why can he go in

549
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,470
without showing his unique skill?

550
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,710
I own this inn.

551
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,070
The rules are made by me.

552
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,070
What's it to you?

553
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,740
If the heavy snow continues for a few more days,

554
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,400
the food at my inn

555
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,310
may not be enough.

556
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,740
Then I'll have to go to the town

557
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,990
dozens of miles away to buy it.

558
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,070
The weather is so cold.

559
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,410
I don't want to bother.

560
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,960
Who said that?

561
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,620
For this distinguished guest,

562
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,870
I'm willing to bother.

563
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,530
Step aside.

564
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,270
No!

565
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,890
Hermit.

566
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,030
This inn isn't a place where ordinary people

567
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,870
can stay.

568
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,750
If you want to rest here,

569
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,270

570
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:49,950
You...

571
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,890
You what?

572
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,960
If you want to use your good looks

573
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,280
to make this landlady change the rule,

574
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,920
then please go in.

575
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,350
After all, it's her who owns the inn

576
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,660
and makes the rules.

577
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,040
It's inappropriate for me to say more.

578
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,390
Ignore this old drunkard

579
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,050
who wants free food and drink.

580
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,800
Please go in.

581
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,890
Unique skills, right?

582
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,470
Don't mind

583
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,430
if I do.

584
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,760
You really have a unique skill?

585
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,830
Guys, come and see!

586
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,540
There's a unique skill!

587
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,750
Come out quickly and see it!

588
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,850
-Let's go.
-Hurry up!

589
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,660
Let's go and see.

590
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,250
Okay.

591
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,480
Let's go.

592
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,710
Let's take a look.

593
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,880
[Swordsman]

594
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,110
I just performed an illusion

595
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,990
to climb a lofty mountain

596
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,520
of the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

597
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
My feet were sore.

598
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,720
While I was resting,

599
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,790
I saw someone coming with a goose cage on his back.

600
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,420
I wanted to borrow the goose cage to rest.

601
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,470
But then I thought I still needed to stay here,

602
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,270
so I came back.

603
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,670
A scholar from Yangxian?

604
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,240
In that case,

605
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,660
we don't need to bother

606
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,810
Landlady tonight.

607
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,830
Let's ask Hermit Jiang

608
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,590
to make some fine alcohol and delicacies

609
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,470
for us to enjoy.

610
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,690
It would be best

611
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,260
if you could make a beauty

612
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,680
to drink

613
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,690
with my friend.

614
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,970
Good. Good.

615
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,780
Although I learnt some illusion skills,

616
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,940
I can't make

617
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,270
fine alcohol and delicacies.

618
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,670
I

619
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,990
can't make a person either.

620
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,720
He got our hopes up for nothing.

621
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,950
This...

622
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,910
In front of so many scholars,

623
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,110
I showed off my skill.

624
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,530
Please don't mind.

626
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,250
Which book is this?

627
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,930
I've never read it before.

628
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,960
It's a mystery tale.

629
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,390
I'll tell you this later.

630
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,510
Hermit.

631
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,110
Don't stand in the snow.

632
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,020
Come in.

633
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,840
Thank you, Landlady.

634
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,370
Please.

635
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,720
You've been

636
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,920
running this inn for seven or eight years, right?

637
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,190
I mean

638
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,510
you should have some vintage alcohol in stock.

639
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,200
Of course.

640
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,030
Good eye.

641
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,350
I've been running this inn for about ten years.

642
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,300
Of course I have vintage alcohol.

644
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,510
I'm in no rush to eat dishes.

645
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,110
Alcohol.

646
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,750
The sooner, the better.

647
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,000
I'd like to get warm.

648
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,750
Okay.

649
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,430
Hurry up and serve our alcohol too.

650
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,910
Serve it together with the dishes.

651
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,070
Also, when serving the chicken,

652
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,200
count how many legs it has.

653
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,660
Don't accuse me of not paying the bill later.

654
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,250
Why are you two looking at me?

655
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,350
Mr. Jiang.

656
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,150
I saw your impressive illusion skill just now.

657
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,820
You even showed us

658
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,390
the essence of scholars in Yangxian.

659
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,590
It was truly amazing.

660
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,350
Since we met at this remote inn

661
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,830
on this snowy night,

662
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,310
would you like to join us for a drink?

663
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,360

Come.

675

and drink together.

676
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,110
Put your bag down.

Who would steal it from you?

678
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,750
No, I can't.

679
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,480
This bag of stuff

680
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,870
is worth more than ten years of salaries you'll receive as an imperial scholar

681
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,910
after you pass the imperial examination.

682
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,810
I can't put it down.

683
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,670
Stop bragging.

684
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,990
Right.

685
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,240
I was just bragging.

686
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,550
Look.

687
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,570
You're being taken advantage of.

688

In the future, in places like this,

689
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,390
you can't pretend to be rich.

This man has graces.

698
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,080

[Good Fortune Throughout the Year]

As I stay awake until midnight,

704
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,980
I get up from the bed and play the lute.

705
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,870
Through the curtains comes the bright moonlight;

706
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,070
The gentle breeze is blowing at my suit.

707
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,110
In the wilderness shrieks the solitary swan;

708
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,350
In the northern woods screams the circling bird.

709
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,350
What do I see while I pace up and down?

710
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,790
Alone I'm sad for what I saw and heard.

711
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,770
It's snowing heavily.

712
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,540
The bright moon is nowhere to be seen.

713

Ruan Sizong's poem "Meditations"

714
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,610
isn't suitable, is it?

715
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,350
Indeed, it's not suitable.

716
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,400
But I like this poem.

717
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,390
It's because it hasn't been given

718
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,990
more implications.

719
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,640
The only thing it expresses

720
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,590
is sadness.

721
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,430
Just sadness.

722
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,530
Why are you suddenly so sad?

723
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,320
The scene just evoked my emotions.

to express your feelings?

727
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,830
I only think of one line.

728
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,550
The rivers and mountains are vast;

729
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,950
They're actually thousands of miles wide.

730
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,670
Thousands of miles wide.

If there was no one inside,

743
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,909
could it be a ghost?

744
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,840
Nonsense.

759
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,800
But it's very efficacious.

760
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,870
When it receives incense,

761
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,530
everything's fine in the inn.

762
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,410
But if we don't give it offerings,

763
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,470
ghosts will haunt the place at night.

764
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,670
It's such a strange god.

765
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,150
I've never seen it before.

766
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:41,800
Mi.

767
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,710
Do... Do you know this god?

768
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,230
Even if he knows the god,

769
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,630
the god doesn't know him.

770
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,480
Stop kowtowing.

771
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,950
It's... It's so scary.

772
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,670
Exactly.

773
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,790
Worshiping the wrong god will bring trouble.

774
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,510
Go away.

775
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,550
Don't disturb me while I'm worshiping the god.

776
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,870
Every time after worshiping the god,

777
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,710
I have to dust off the god.

778
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,750
It's so cold here.

779
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,550
Let's go back.

780
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,100
Seeing this god today,

781
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,430
I feel it's very mighty.

782
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,550
I want to serve here all night

783
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,490
in order to be blessed with safety in the future.

784
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,030
No.

785
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,030
Get him a blanket.

786
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,400
Hermit.

787
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,990
A toast to you.

788
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,250
Cheers.

789
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,910
Landlady.

790
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,990
There're so many people here.

791
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,870
You don't toast us.

792
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,750
Why do you only toast him?

793
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,350
I toast whomever I want.

794
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,280
It's none of your business.

795
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,620
Get lost.

796
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,830
How rude of you!

797
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,720
Not only did you not toast us,

798
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,960
you also cursed me.

799
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,540
When you cursed me before,

800
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,420
I did nothing.

801
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,150
Now I have so many friends

802
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,800
here.

803
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,190
We're staying at your superior rooms

804
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,680
and having your food and drink.

805
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,310
You've already earned our silver ingots.

806
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:23,750
You...

807
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,120
You still cursed me.

808
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,360
I'm old.

809
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,910
Should I be cursed by you?

810
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,350
You're taking advantage of your old age, right?

811
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,270
Fine.

812
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,860
After I toast Hermit,

813
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,510
I'll toast you.

814
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,580
Hermit.

815
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,350
Landlady, thanks again.

816
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,820
It's your turn.

817
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,490
Drinking alone is boring.

818
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,560
Why don't we play something exciting?

819
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,200
How?

820
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,900
How about the Tokhara Knife?

821
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,610
This... This...

822
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,060
This thing is too dangerous. I won't play.

823
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,380
You don't dare to play?

824
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,560
It's not that I don't dare to play.

825
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,470
I still want to drink for a hundred years.

826
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,310
Then

827
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,430
it's not me who don't toast you.

828
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,690
It's you who're not worth being toasted.

829
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,260
Fed.

830
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,170
Enough.

831
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,230
Drink.

832
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,340
Here.

833
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,500
The blade of this dagger

834
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,790
is usually retracted in the handle.

835
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,990
There're nine gems around this circle.

836
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,300
Only when one of them is pressed

837
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,860
will the blade come out.

838
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,160
The rule of the game is

839
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,790
that two people participate.

840
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,020
One person turns the button

841
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,110
and hands it to the other person.

842
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,060
The other person places the knife in front of his chest

843
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,990
and presses the button on the tail.

844
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,750
If the blade doesn't come out,

845
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,280
the one who turns the button

846
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,220
will toast him with a bowl of alcohol.

847
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,710
If the blade comes out,

848
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,550
then everyone here

849
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,990
will toast him a bowl of alcohol.

850
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,060
When you showed your unique skill,

851
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,520
you looked quite valiant.

852
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,740
Let's play it.

853
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,200
I've heard about

854
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,260
the Tokhara Knife before.

855
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,110
It was once popular in the Western Region

856
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,110
but was banned early in our country.

857
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,390
I'll never participate.

858
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,590
So you're just a good-looking but useless man.

859
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:05,790
You...

860
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,350
Forget it.

861
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,830
Swordsman.

862
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,480
You look scary with this sword.

863
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,150
You pretend not to hear me at this moment.

864
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,870
I didn't expect that on this snowy night,

865
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,690
no one in the Mo's Inn

866
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,660
has guts.

867
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,080
I'll play it.

868
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,090
But I want to add a bet.

869
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,990
The gold coin you just got.

870
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,710
Okay.

871
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,990
If I lose,

872
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,770
I'll give him the gold coin.

873
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,660
Mistress.

874
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,750
It's dangerous.

875
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,410
Don't do it.

876
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,360
How dare you try to control me?

877
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,030
Mistress.

878
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,140
Put down the gold coin and get lost.

879
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,910
The gold coin is right there.

880
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,840
What's your bet?

881
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,870
Me?

882
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,350
If I lose,

883
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,820
I'll stay and be your man.

884
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,360
I'm much better than your disobedient

885
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,510
old waiter, right?

886
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,630
After all,

887
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,350
I can read poems for you in front of flowers.

888
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,010
I'm very gentle.

889
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,550
If you lose,

890
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,190
you'll die.

891
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,830
Go and be a gentle ghost.

892
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,110
Then...

893
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,150
Then...

894
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,110
Then I need to reconsider it.

895
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:30,590
No way!

896
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,820
You already gave your word.

897
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,850
The bet is set.

898
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,670
No...

899
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,550
Please.

900
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,940
If you win, you'll get the gold coin.

901
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,870
If you lose, you'll get the beauty.

902
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,750
What I want to say is

903
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,750
that if you don't die,

904
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,660
you'll win both.

905
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,400
Honey.

906
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,660
A toast to you.

907
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,120
It's your turn.

908
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,760
Spin it.

909
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:35,830
Honey.

910
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,470
Please.
