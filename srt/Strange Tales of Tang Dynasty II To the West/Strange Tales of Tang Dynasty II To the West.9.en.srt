[Episode 9]

4
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,870
Hasn't your daughter-in-law, Chuntiao,

5
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,700
come back?

6
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,150
She?

7
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,550
After my son died,

8
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,070
she became even crazier.

9
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,190
What...

10
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,570
What does that mean?

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,740
She despised my son for being a coroner.

12
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,090
They quarreled every day,

13
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,710
and she often ran away.

14
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,260
Coroners are not government officers.

15
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,070
They are neither officials

16
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,030
nor clerks.

17
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,070
They are only called upon

18
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,590
when there is a murder case.

19
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,670
The payment for postmortem is pitifully low.

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,520
Since they often deal with corpses,

21
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,430
people think karma will find them,

22
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,079
and thus,

23
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,110
they are not respected.

24
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:32,829
However,

25
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,590
a coroner is indispensable

26
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,230
and irreplaceable

27
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,990
in solving cases.

28
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,110
Determining the time of death,

29
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,990
reconstructing the method of the crime,

30
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,110
and finding the murder weapon

31
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,840
all rely on the coroner.

32
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,470
It is truly a humble position with heavy responsibilities.

33
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,390
You...

34
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,110
actually understand coroners so well.

35
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,350
Many people

36
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,270
are unwilling to live next to a coroner.

37
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,210
In many places,

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,480
they even require coroners

39
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,190
to use doors made of black wood

40
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,270
to distinguish them from others.

41
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,530
Just now, when I came in, I noticed it.

42
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,110
It looks like Shiyang

43
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,120
also has this custom.

44
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,240
People from a coroner's family

45
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,190
cannot participate in the imperial examinations.

46
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,280
If it's a girl,

47
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,990
it's not easy to find a good marriage.

48
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,190
You understand the hardships

49
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,390
of a coroner's family so well.

50
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,150
Madam,

51
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,190
today, it was my honor to assist you in the postmortem.

52
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,150
Your precise technique and accurate judgment

53
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,790
have truly impressed me.

54
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,990
After hearing what you said,

55
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,430
I'm no longer afraid of losing face.

56
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,560
Although Chuntiao is good,

57
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,830
I'm afraid

58
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,770
she can't escape involvement

59
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,190
in my son's death.

60
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,269
She has a younger brother

61
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,470
named Chunshan.

Dong Haogu,

65
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,670
I'm warning you!

66
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,910
If you dare to seduce my sister ever again,

67
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,110
I won't go easy on you!

68
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,230
She's here for tea.

69
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,000
How could you say I seduced her?

70
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,390
There's no smoke without fire!

71
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,750
You don't have to admit it.

72
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,680
But I, Chunshan,

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,490
am upright!

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,430
And my brother-in-law treats me well.

75
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,330
Even the shoes on my feet

76
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,330
were given by him.

77
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,390
Consider this a warning today.

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,470
If it happens again,

79
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,310
I'll kill you!

80
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,090
Can this be considered speaking out of righteousness?

81
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,870
You came to tell me about it,

82
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,060
aren't you afraid that my son will kill your sister?

83
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,520
[Chunshan, Dugu Yang's brother-in-law]

84
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,330
Well...

85
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,160
She deserves it.

86
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,830
I, Chunshan, am a man of integrity

87
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,550
and can't stand such things.

88
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,610
If this continues,

89
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,610
it won't be my sister

90
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,670
being killed by my brother-in-law,

91
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,330
but my brother-in-law

92
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,530

93
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,110
Fine.

94
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,150
How much money

95
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,600
do you want

96
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,510
from me today?

97
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,330
Chunshan is a ne'er-do-well.

98
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,500
I suspect

99
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,210
that on that day,

100
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,590
he actually went to extort Dong Haogu,

101
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,950
and only turned against him because he didn't get the money.

102
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,880
However, the affair between Dong Haogu and Chuntiao

103
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,350
may not be entirely false.

104
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,990
After Dugu Yang found out,

105
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,230
what did he say?

106
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,670
My son is honest.

107
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,830
He didn't say anything.

108
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,830
Is Chuntiao back?

109
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,950
No.

110
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,030
It sounds

111
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,070
like a thief.

112
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,350
A thief?

113
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,470
Mr. Su.

114
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,840
Let me do it.

115
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,110
How dare you!

116
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,060
Stop!

117
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,790
If this thief is dead,

118
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,750
there's no need for an autopsy.

119
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,880
He died from bleeding inside the skull

120
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,550
caused by a heavy blow to the back of the head.

121
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,830
Madam, don't worry.

122
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,390
He won't die.

123
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,350
Who ambushed me?

124
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,150
It hurts so much.

125
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,230
Chunshan, how dare you?

126
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,630
What did you go to Dugu Yang's house

127
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,350
to steal?

128
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,790
Steal?

129
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,830
Dugu Yang was my brother-in-law.

130
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,510
The shoes on my feet were given by him.

131
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,150
I went to my brother-in-law's house today

132
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,880
just to take some more clothes.

133
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,550
Was that stealing?

134
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,790
My brother-in-law has already died.

135
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,100
Except for me,

136
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,750
who else can his clothes be left to?

137
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,310
You know Dugu Yang has died?

138
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,490
You're the one who killed him, aren't you?

139
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,810
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,830
I, Chunshan,

141
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,760
am a man of integrity and pride.

142
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,159
Don't think just because you're high up there

143
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,360
that you can slander others as you wish.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
So it's a misunderstanding.

145
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,830
You can leave now.

146
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,830
I can leave?

147
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,110
Goodbye.

148
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,790
Wait.

149
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,990
Is this yours?

Yes!

151

No!

152
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,550
It's not mine.

Search him.

155
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,720
This is a burial goods store.

156
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,670
This clay figurine is for deterring tomb robbers.

157
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,800
You are so careless.

158
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,590
How did you solve the previous cases?

159
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,550
I...

160
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,680
Chunshan.

161
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,600
This dice

162
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,070
was found

163
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,670
at the scene where Dugu Yang was killed.

164
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,810
Put him to torture.

165
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:19,930
No, no, no!

166
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,220
Don't torture me! Don't torture me!

167
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,110
I'll confess.

168
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,850
I'll confess everything.

169
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,950
Big or Small?

170
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,660
Big! Big! Big!

171
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,830
Small! Small!

172
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,350
Small!

173
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:34,710
Big!

174
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,740
Dice are out.

175
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,470
Small!

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,110
Big!

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,950
Small!

178
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,180
Chunshan,

179
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,920
the gambling tools this time

180
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,550
were brought by you yourself.

181
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,810
Are you convinced now?

182
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,390
Could it be that I'll never turn my luck around

183
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,790
in this lifetime?

184
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,230
Dong?

185
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,630
If you want to turn your luck around,

186
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,180
come to Treasure Pavilion.

187
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,710
Forget it.

188
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,450
Dong Haogu,

189
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,740
I've never gotten involved in the affair

190
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,140
between you and my sister.

191
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm a bit tight on cash now.

192
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,880
Could you lend me some money?

193
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Never?

194
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,670
Then who came to extort me last time?

195
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,430
How could that be extortion?

196
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,070
I, Chunshan, am righteous.

197
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,070
Last time, I was just reminding you.

198
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,670
Are you lending me money or not?

199
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,590
Making money

200
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,940
is better than borrowing.

201
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,380
Making money?

202
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,490
If I knew how to make money,

203
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,430
I would have gotten an umbrella like yours.

204
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,590
Help me find a thing.

205
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,150
Once I get it,

206
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,790
I'll pay you this amount.

207
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,840
Three thousand?

208
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,160
Look at your ambition.

209
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,120
Well,

210
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,750
even if it's just finding a lump of dirt,

211
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,610
it'll still take time and effort.

212
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,030
Three hundred...

213
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
Isn't it a bit too little?

214
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,750
Okay!

215
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,310
I can accept 300 mace.

216
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,240
Tell me, what do you need me to find?

217
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,740
I'm talking about thirty thousand mace.

218
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,350
Thirty thousand?

219
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,990
What do you want to find?

220
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,490
Dugu Xin?

221
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,840
[Justice]

222
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,620
Multifaceted Seal?

223
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,070
Yes.

224
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,620
Dong Haogu said

225
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,990
it's a treasure.

226
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,270
I was thinking

227
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,980
Dugu Yang definitely

228
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,910
didn't keep the treasure

229
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,750
at home.

230
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,230
Otherwise, my sister would have known long ago

231
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,360
and wouldn't have had such a hard life.

232
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,680
Since it was not at home,

233
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,120
it must be at the burial goods store.

234
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,670
But Dugu Yang

235
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,830
was at the burial goods store every day,

236
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,560
working on those clay figurines until midnight.

237
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,260
I followed him for several days,

238
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,220
and finally,

239
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,840
I found an opportunity.

240
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,430
Coroner Dugu has a beautiful wife,

241
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,870
yet she was taken advantage of by others.

242
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,110
Bad boys!

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,850
Get lost!

244
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,190
The new magistrate's surname is also Dugu.

245
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,550
You know what?

246
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,530
He invited me for drinks tonight.

247
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,430
He said the magistrate invited him for drinks.

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,800
As soon as I heard that, I knew it was just boasting.

249
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,140
No need to record this.

250
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,430
It must be recorded.

251
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,470
Chunshan,

252
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,500
keep going.

253
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,720
My goodness.

254
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,510
He's been dealing with these every day.

255
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,440
They scared me.

256
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,750
Those clay figurines my brother-in-law made

257
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,950
all have mechanisms.

258
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,650
I dared not touch them.

259
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,890
So I searched inside and outside every room.

260
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,350
I searched for an hour

261
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,930
and still couldn't find it.

262
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,030
So I thought,

263
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,670
I might as well wait for him to return and tell him directly

264
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,150
that if he has the treasure, he should bring it out,

265
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,260
and I'll go and find Dong Haogu on his behalf,

266
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,400
get a good price,

267
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,440
and take a share.

268
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,660
So,

269
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,960
I sat on the chair waiting for him.

270
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,520
That's the whole story.

271
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,680
So I left the dice

272
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,730
at the burial goods store.

273
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,100
I went out of town yesterday

274
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,030
to meet a friend.

275
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,160
When I returned,

276
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,670
I heard that Dugu Yang had died.

277
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,590
I cried so hard.

278
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,070
Since I was young,

279
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,270
my brother-in-law

280
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,550
has been the best person to me.

281
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,240
I told you

282
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,540
I wasn't stealing.

283
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,740
I just wanted to keep some of his clothes

284
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,080
as a memento.

285
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,080
Yang!

286
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,550
How could you pass away like this?

287
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,890
Who will take care of me in the future?

288
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,910
Enough. Stop crying.

289
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,230
What you said

290
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,990
does make sense.

291
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,550
Everything I said is true.

292
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,550
Chunshan,

293
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,600
you can't leave.

294
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,550
I'll find a place for you

295
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,470
to think about

296
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,590
what else you overlooked.

297
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,110
Guards.

298
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,450
Take him away.

299
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:02,840
Yes.

300
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,600
Get up!

301
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
Magistrate Dugu!

302
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,710
Magistrate Dugu!

303
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,510
What is it?

304
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,870
Officer Niu, did you find any clues?

305
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,430
That Chuntiao

306
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,990
is indeed a bad guy!

307
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,440
Tell us!

308
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,340
Since I got the order,

309
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,710
I've been watching Chuntiao.

310
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,690
Her husband just died,

311
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,070
but instead of staying at home,

312
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,130
she went to Treasure Pavilion again.

313
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,430
Calm down.

314
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,710
Take your time.

315
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,590
I was afraid of being exposed,

316
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,710
so I didn't follow them upstairs.

317
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,190
But half an hour later,

318
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,660
when Chuntiao came out,

319
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,490
Dong Haogu came out with her.

320
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,960
[Treasure Pavilion]

321
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,310
Why do I still feel

322
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,510
uneasy?

323
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,990
Dugu Yang made so many clay figurines.

324
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,040
He blocked the revenue stream of tomb robbers.

325
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,930
He must be killed by them.

326
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,470
They can't trace it to us.

327
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,790
I was right beside them at the time.

328
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,070
I heard everything clearly!

329
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,150
Shameless!

330
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,120
How vicious!

331
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,190
Officer Niu,

332
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,250
why didn't you arrest them directly?

333
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,290
Well...

334
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,550
I still need your order.

335
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,440
Besides,

336
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,650
Mr. Su is also here.

337
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,990
I need your agreement

338
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,390
before I can arrest them.

339
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,000
That couple of adulterers are so vicious and cruel.

340
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,310
Even if they were jailed,

341
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,230
I don't think they would confess.

342
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,630
So,

343
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,440
we must put them to torture.

344
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,520
Magistrate,

345
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,190
shall I go and arrest them now?

346
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,920
Arrest them.

347
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:28,790
Yes!

348
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,710
Mr. Su.

349
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,310
Dugu Yang has just died,

350
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,590
and Chuntiao went to Treasure Pavilion.

351
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,150
This raised suspicions.

352
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,150
As for Dong Haogu,

353
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,230
he promised thirty thousand mace

354
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,470
to Chunshan to find

355
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,870
Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal,

356
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,400
indicating he had motives.

357
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,780
Then there's Chuntiao.

358
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,740
Her statement,

359
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,950
"How could they trace it to us?"

360
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,430
has already exposed them.

361
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,250
Did I analyze this correctly?

362
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,550
Zhou,

363
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,450
come with me.

364
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,349
Yes.

365
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,880
Magistrate,

366
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,470
what did Mr. Su mean?

367
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,109
He...

368
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,230
I...

369
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,070
Let's split into two groups.

370
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,700
The four of you

371
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,750
go and find Dong Haogu.

372
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,680
I'll go and capture Chuntiao.

373
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,410
Officer Niu,

374
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,070
do you need a person to assist you?

375
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,550
No need.

376
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,490
She's just a woman.

377
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,420
I can handle her.

378
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,660
Dong Haogu, on the other hand,

379
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,430
is extremely dangerous.

380
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,110
Remember,

381
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,760
if he shows any resistance,

382
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,380
don't let him harm you.

383
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,000
Kill him on the spot directly.

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,350
Yes!

385
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,410
Let's go!

386
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,070
What...

387
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,710
What...

388
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,450
What are you doing?

389
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,630
Son,

390
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,260
Officer Niu from the government office came to our house.

391
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,710
But he came in with a broadsword

392
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,820
and asked me what I was doing.

393
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,400
I'm telling you,

394
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,310
Dugu Yang was murdered by Chuntiao

395
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,590
and Dong Haogu.

396
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,200
I am here to capture the murderers!

397
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,330
Niu Daming,

398
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,730
what are you doing?

399
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,390
Capturing a murderer.

400
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,830
Anyone who resists

401
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,690
will be killed.

402
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,740
So, are you going to resist

403
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,590
or not?

404
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,490
You want to kill me?

405
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,110
I am carrying out my superior's order

406
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,000
to arrest you,

407
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
but you are not cooperating.

408
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,830
Mother!

409
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,870
Help me!

410
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,310
Mother!

411
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,550
How dare you gash my son!

412
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,480
Mother!

413
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,550
Help!

414
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,910
Help!

415
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,980
What are you doing?

416
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,840
Officer Niu,

417
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,050
what are you doing?

418
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,950
Zhou!

419
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,500
Step aside!

420
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,030
It's none of your business!

421
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,740
Who do you think you are?

422
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,780
Is there anyone in Shiyang County

423
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,150
who can stop me?

424
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,590
Niu Daming!

425
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,830
Are you crazy?

426
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,510
You impersonated Su Wuming,

427
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,270
and now you're colluding with a murderer.

428
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,200
Step aside.

429
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,440
Or don’t blame me for what my broadsword might do.

430
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,670
Try me.

431
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,710
Mr. Su!

432
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,470
Mr. Su!

433
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,430
Who do you think you are

434
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,510
to play the hero?

435
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,600
You’re truly overestimating yourself.

436
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,410
Who are you talking to?

437
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,950
Don't you know?

438
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,030
Who are you

439
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,910
to talk to me like this?

440
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,570
You’re the one who's overestimating yourself.

441
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,480
Didn't you understand

442
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,180
what I told you that day?

443
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,880
I don't want to have any further entanglements

444
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,790
with you, a girl from the Jianghu.

445
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,960
Why did you follow me

446
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
to Shiyang?

447
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,430
Su Wuming,

448
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,350
you...

449
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,110
People with a sharp sword

450
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,690
must either be a bandit or a thief.

451
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,670
Leave Shiyang immediately!

452
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,850
Are you waiting for me to inform the magistrate

453
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,650
and have you thrown into prison?

454
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,870
Mr. Su,

455
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,950
how did you find out

456
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,640
it was Niu Daming?

457
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,190
Since I got the order, I've been watching Chuntiao.

458
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,290
Her husband just died,

459
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,670
but instead of staying at home,

460
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,590
she went to Treasure Pavilion again.

461
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,670
He inadvertently

462
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,010
used the word "again".

463
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,270
There are only two possibilities.

464
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,270
First, he already knew

465
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,090
that Chuntiao had been to Treasure Pavilion before.

466
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,740
Second,

467
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,070
he had already

468
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,640
followed Chuntiao before.

469
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,310
Exactly.

470
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,160
If something

471
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,050
happens to you,

472
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,070
you would need a coroner too.

473
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,830
Nonsense!

474
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,910
Niu,

475
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,910
you are intentionally trying to disgust me.

476
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,110
Magistrate Dugu,

477
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,720
please manage Niu Daming.

478
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,230
He's bulling me.

479
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,390
I remember now.

480
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,390
They knew each other before,

481
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,450
or are very familiar with each other.

482
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,510
However,

483
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,830
what really exposed him

484
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,630
was what he made up.

485
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,340
Why do I still feel

486
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,470
uneasy?

487
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,840
Dugu Yang made so many clay figurines.

488
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,830
He blocked the revenue stream of tomb robbers.

489
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,630
He must be killed by them.

490
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,220
They can't trace it to us.

491
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,830
Niu Daming,

492
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,060
you said you waited downstairs at Treasure Pavilion

493
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,620
for half an hour.

494
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,550
If they were truly accomplices,

495
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,580
why didn't they coordinate their confessions during that half an hour,

496
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,100
instead of waiting to come before you

497
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,390
to say those words?

498
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,350
Do you think this makes sense?

499
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,750
Besides,

500
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,590
the magistrate asked a good question.

501
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,710
How vicious!

502
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,680
Officer Niu,

503
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,880
why didn't you arrest them directly?

504
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,870
If Chuntiao and Dong Haogu

505
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,910
really said those words,

506
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,370
they would have completely exposed themselves

507
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,840
as the murderers.

508
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,990
Why didn't you arrest them directly,

509
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,390
but instead came back to report?

510
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,890
That couple of adulterers are so vicious and cruel.

511
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,150
Even if they were jailed,

512
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,190
I don't think they would confess.

513
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,410
So, we must put them to torture.

514
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,470
You were trying to cover up your own lies

515
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,110
in advance,

516
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,430
attempting to coerce

517
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,150
Chuntiao and Dong Haogu into taking the blame

518
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,520
by torturing them.

519
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,310
Could it be that the real murderer of Dugu Yang

520
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,230
is you, Niu Daming?

521
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,030
I lusted after Chuntiao,

522
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,190
but I couldn't win her over.

523
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,350
So I sought revenge.

524
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,300
I admit to that.

525
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,790
But as for me killing Dugu Yang,

526
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,410
what evidence do you have?

527
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,830
Magistrate,

528
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,590
the night watchman Uncle Zhong

529
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,190
took down the reward notice.

530
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,960
The night watchman?

531
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,290
Call him in.

532
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,150
Yes!

533
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,400
Uncle Zhong,

534
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,310
you have clues about the murder case?

535
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,750
Yes.

536
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,430
Isn't there a reward?

537
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,710
I want to know if it's 300

538
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,030
or 500 mace.

539
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,660
Well...

540
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,550
It depends on the importance

541
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,350
of the information you provide.

542
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,870
I'll tell you.

543
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,580
Listen

544
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,790
carefully.

545
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,430
At around 1 o'clock this morning,

546
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,990
I saw...

547
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,910
him!

548
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,150
It was him!

549
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,830
He killed

550
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,430
Dugu Yang,

551
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,530
and fled.

552
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,140
I saw it crystal clear!

553
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,710
Nonsense!

554
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,070
I...

555
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,540
Let go of me!

556
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,240
I didn't kill him.

557
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,350
I didn't kill him!

558
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,270
Whether you killed him

559
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,600
cannot be proved by your own words.

560
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:49,710
Yes!

561
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,280
Do you dare to say

562
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,000
you didn't go to the burial goods store yesterday?

563
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,800
I did go there.

564
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,390
But it was not at 1 o'clock.

565
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,550
I was on duty last night.

566
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,030
I left the government office at 9:30 p.m.,

567
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,790
and arrived at the burial goods store at the latest at 9:45 p.m.

568
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,510
I said a few words and left.

569
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,550
I wanted to inform Dugu Yang

570
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,430
that Chuntiao and Dong Haogu were close.

571
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,350
I wanted him to cause trouble

572
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,630
for Dong Haogu.

573

[Lingdu Burial Goods Store]

574
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,350
Say something.

575
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,290
If I were you,

576
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,180
I would kill that Dong Haogu!

577
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,150
Coroners cannot kill people.

578
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,020
So are you just going to stand by and watch your wife

579
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,580
go to another guy every day?

580
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,990
Do you have any backbone?

581
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,470
I'm busy.

582
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,690
If there's nothing else,

583
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,190
you can leave now.

584
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,710
You can divorce Chuntiao.

585
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,940
This is my family affair.

586
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,090
It's none of your business.

587
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,350
Actually, I just wanted him

588
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,370
to divorce Chuntiao.

589
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,630
Then I could take the opportunity to please her

590
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,230
and ask Chuntiao to marry me.

591
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,990
But he acted like it was nothing.

592
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,220
Since I couldn't get what I wanted at the moment,

593
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,100
I left.

594
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,190
Nonsense!

595
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,070
You're the murderer!

596
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,830
You can't deny it!

597
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,710
Zhong,

598
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,880
I have no grievances with you.

599
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,700
Why are you framing me?

600
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,110
I...

601
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,470
I often went to

602
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,400

00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,390
Coroner Dugu...

604
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,900
is a good person.

605
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,070
A really good person.

606
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,110
You were

609
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,710
and developed evil intentions.

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,720
You...

611
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,990
are so malicious!

612
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,790
How dare you slander me!

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,430

Dong Haogu has been arrested.

620

Let him wait.

621
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,750
Let him wait!

622
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,390
Yes.

623
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,590
Magistrate,

624
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,430
she's fine.

625
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,390
She just needs to rest

626
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,350
and cannot be frightened again.

627
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,030
Thank you.

628
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,510
Magistrate, why haven't you summoned me to be interrogated?

629
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,820
You're not a suspect.

630
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,910
There's no need for interrogation.

631
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,730
Have a seat.

632
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,520
Are you going to ask about Dong Haogu

633
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,430
or Niu Daming?

634
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,710
I don't even know where to start.

635
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,230
Then start from today.

636
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,940
When I came back from the postmortem,

637
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,200
I was told that Dugu Yang was really dead.

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,360

Have some tea.

642
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,190
The death of Dugu Yang

643
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,720
has nothing to do with you, does it?

644
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,880
What do you mean?

645
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,970
Are you suspecting me?

646
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,640
Of course I'm suspecting you.

647
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,760
Since the first time we met,

648
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,150
you've been asking me about the seal

649
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,550
Dugu Yang had been keeping.

650
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,390
Afterward, you had me investigate

651
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,390
where his seal was hidden

652
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,310
several times.

653
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,470
Yes.

654
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,790
I do cherish antiques like my life.

655
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,660
But I would never kill for them.

656
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,490
Are you telling the truth?

657
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,110
Every antique in Treasure Pavilion

658
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,230
is genuine.

659
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,720
Every word I have said

660
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,190
is true.

661
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,780
I know it's not the right time

662
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,880
to ask you this question.

663
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,140
But I just want to know,

664
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,210
if on one side there's this seal,

665
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,040
and on the other side, there's me,

666
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,570
and you can only choose one,

667
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,110
which one would you choose?

668
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,510
What a question.

669
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,500
You holding this seal in your hand,

670
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,700
and me holding you in my arms,

671
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,560
wouldn't that solve the problem?

I...

675
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,150
I do desire that multifaceted seal,

676
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,940
but I genuinely feel fond of you too.

677
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,090
I love antiques,

678
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,590
but I'm not greedy.

679
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,870
It's just that, in my opinion,

680
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,110
ordinary people don't deserve to possess

681
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,090
those ultimate masterpieces.

682
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,270
Just like Dugu Yang doesn't deserve

683
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,470
to have someone as unique as you.

684
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,510
He's already dead!

685
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,370
You don't deserve to mention him!

686
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,550
Let me ask you.

687
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,710
What if

688
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,240
I were to give you that seal?

689
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,830
Do you really have the seal?

690
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,740
Answer me!

691
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,600
I'll marry you!

692
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Is that seal really that important?

693
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,150
From the beginning,

694
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,430
were you just flattering me,

695
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,110
inviting me for tea,

696
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,020
and drinking with me,

697
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,870
all for that seal?

698
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,480
I...

699
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,070
Dugu Yang,

700
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,590
I'm sorry.

701
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,470
Chuntiao!

702
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,600
Chuntiao!

703
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,450
How many times have you followed me now?

704
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,780
I can't even keep count.

705
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,240
But this time is different from before.

706
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,770
I was ordered to follow you.

707
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,470
If I hadn't, I wouldn't have known

708
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,530
you went to see that Dong Haogu again.

709
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,010
What are you trying to say?

710
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,110
Dugu Yang is dead.

711
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,780
Even if you want to remarry,

712
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,980
you can't choose him.

713
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,480
He's a businessman.

714
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,630
No matter how much money he has,

715
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,160
can he truly treat you well?

716
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,430
So you're saying

717
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,070
you can treat me well?

718
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,210
Am I not treating you well?

719
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:15,810
Chuntiao,

720
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,830
search your heart and answer me.

721
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,510
Niu Daming,

722
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,640
you took me home when I was drunk

723
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,990
and tried to rape me!

724
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,540
I haven't reported you yet!

725
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,230
I...

726
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:25,830
Yes.

727
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,910
I am highly skilled in martial arts.

728
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,070
Do you think

729
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,710
I really couldn't force you?

730
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,950
I just don't want to force you.

731
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,990
I want you to willingly

732
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,620
be with me.

733
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,990
I'm willing to wait.

734
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,450
This day has finally come.

735
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,110
Dugu Yang is dead.

736
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,590
Can you marry me now?

737
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,830
Shameless!

738
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,510
Yes.

739
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,750
He just died.

740
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,030
I know it's not the right time

741
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,190
to say these things.

742
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,750
A month later,

743
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,840
I will send someone to propose to you on my behalf.

744
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,440
I, Chuntiao, would rather die

745
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,100
than let you, a despicable man,

746
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,750
get what you want.

747
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,710
Get lost!

748
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,750
I, Chuntiao, have been reckless,

749
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,460
but I am innocent.

750
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,070
I went out to have tea

751
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,300
or drinks with others

752
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,179
only because

753
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,830
Dugu Yang was indifferent to me.

754
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,980
I wanted to change my life.

755
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,500
Why am I not crying,

756
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,030
yet the magistrate is crying?

757
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,949
Magistrate Dugu is thinking of

758
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,989
another girl who has a similar experience

759
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,150
to yours.

760
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,870
Magistrate, you are so soft-hearted.

761
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:53,550
Chuntiao.

762
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,949
Tell me.

763
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,949
Is Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal

764
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,270
in your possession?

765
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,150
No.

766
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,470
I have never seen

767
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,990
that multifaceted seal.

768
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,840
Eat it while it's hot.

769
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,750
I'm going out for tea!

770
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,920
Honey.

771
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,910
Can you stop

772
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,510
going out for tea?

773
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,880
If I don't go out for tea,

774
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,550
should I stay here with you and watch over

775
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,010
these mud figures that fill up half the room?

776
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,120
I'm doing this to support the family.

777
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,630
What a joke.

778
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,750
You've been making mud figures for so long.

779
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,380
But I haven't seen you

780
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,580
bring home any money.

781
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,480
It has been seven years.

782
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,670
In your eyes, am I just

783
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,190
a woman who loves money?

784
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,710
I don't even like tea.

785
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,630
I just want someone to talk to.

786
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,310
I hope that person is you.

787
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,740
But Dugu Yang,

788
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,870
ever since you opened this burial goods store,

789
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,950
do you know

790
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,390
that you've almost become

791
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,650
a mud figure yourself?

792
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,740
Actually, we don't have to work so hard.

793
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,850
Do you remember

794
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,590
what you told me

795
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,030
when we just got married?

796
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,510
You said

797
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:38,830
you had

798
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,710
a precious seal.

799
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,100
Can I take a look at it?

800
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,280
What are you up to?

801
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,310
No.

802
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,030
It was Dong Haogu who told me

803
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,100
he knows you have that seal.

804
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,970
Impossible!

805
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,520
The seal cannot be sold.

806
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,230
Honey,

807
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,830
that seal has been passed down

808
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,890
from my ancestors.

809
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,750
Its existence proves

810
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,150
that the Dugu family

811
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,510
still has descendants.

812
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,090
Who does Dong Haogu

813
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,170
think he is?

814
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,590
Everything in his Treasure Pavilion combined

815
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,250
isn't worth as much as my seal.

816
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,700
He's just flattering you

817
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,900
to trick me into selling the seal.

818
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,310
Go and tell him

819
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,490
to stop dreaming.

820
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,490
Over my dead body!

821
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,390
If he has the guts,

822
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,910
he can come and kill me!

823
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,350
It's okay you don't want to sell it!

824
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,150
Why did you say such harsh words?

825
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,950
Descendants?

826
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,110
You're just a coroner.

827
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,750
Your descendants can never take

828
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,370
the imperial examinations in their lifetime!

829
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,300
They can only be coroners forever!

830
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,790
I don't want to bear your children.

831
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,630
I was just speaking out of anger.

832
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,470
I wanted him to sell that seal

833
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,640
so that we would have money,

834
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,710
and he can take me away from Shiyang

835
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,620
to a place

836
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,780
where no one knows

837
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,230
he was ever a coroner,

838
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,900
so we could live a good life.

839
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,960
Then I would be able

840
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,700
to bear his children.

841
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,260
Have you got it all down?

842
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,810
Dong Haogu,

843
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,070
I'm going to ask you questions now.

844
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,070
Think carefully before you answer.

845
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,530
Because every word you say

846
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,760
will be recorded.

847
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,510
Do you know why I called you here?

848
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,150
Dugu Yang is dead.

849
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,390
I have seduced Chuntiao before.

850
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,540
I've also been longing

851
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,030
for Dugu Xin Jet Tumbled Stone Multifaceted Seal.

852
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,910
Last night,

853
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,160
I went to the burial goods store twice.

854
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,750
But I didn't kill him.

855
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,630
Twice?

856
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,450
When were they?

857
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,030
Why did you go to the burial goods store?

858
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,670
Yesterday I had some drinks

859
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,190
and couldn't sleep by 9 p.m.

860
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,910
I felt upset.

861
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,110
I've been in Shiyang for four years.

862
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,060
It was because I learned

863
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,060
Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal is here.

864
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:21,910
Initially,

865
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,470
I thought it was in some ancient tomb,

866
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,800
so I kept trying to buy it from tomb robbers

867
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,990
and failed.

868
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,890
After many twists and turns, I finally found out

869
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,590
it's actually with Dugu Yang,

870
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,020
a poor coroner.

871
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,430
When exactly

872
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,590
did you go to the burial goods store?

873
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,310
I left home at 9:45 p.m.

874
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,900
[Lingdu Burial Goods Store]

875
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,380
Aren't you going to ask me why I'm here?

876
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,070
What else could it be,

877
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,320
besides the seal?

878
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,430
Smart man.

879
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,040
In fact, besides Chuntiao,

880
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,840
I also asked

881
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,380
your unreliable brother-in-law,

882
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,060
Chunshan.

883
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,620
But I thought about it,

884
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,320
why don't we talk face to face?

885
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,120
So I came here in the rain.

886
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,290
I didn't expect

887
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,560
you'd actually be in the shop.

888
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,130
Let's get straight to the point.

889
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,950
I'll pay you 150 thousand mace.

890
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,510
Sell me Dugu Xin

891
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,650
Multifaceted Seal.

892
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,270
No.

893
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,920
It's a waste

894
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,680
in your hands anyway, isn't it?

895
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,550
Dugu Yang,

896
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,400
is that seal really a family heirloom?

897
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,740
Who would believe you're a descendant

898
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,630
of Dugu Xin?

899
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,700
Fine.

900
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,560
I was convinced.

901
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,720
I'll pay you 180 thousand mace.

902
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,870
Take a look

903
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,400
at where your mother lives.

904
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,790
You finally got a wife,

905
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,790
but she always goes out with others.

906
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,230
Look at you.

907
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,800
Keeping the treasure seal is useless for you.

908
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,550
It's better to exchange it for some money

909
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,010
and turn your luck around.

910
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,410
Your ancestors in heaven

911
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,670
would also be pleased.

912
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,610
Are you really not selling it?

913
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,750
Your head must be made of mud.

914
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,990
200 thousand.

915
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,950
300 thousand.

916
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,800
Do you really have the seal?

917
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,410
This is how much I want,

918
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,470
not a penny less.

919
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,910
230 thousand.

920
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,350
240 thousand.

921
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,250
Dugu Yang,

922
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,720
300 thousand is impossible.

923
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,470
250 thousand!

924
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,190
Deal!

925
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,720
I've figured it out.

926
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,630
I do need money.

927
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,520
Here's what you're going to do:

928
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,410
convert all the money into silver ingots.

929
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,870
Bring it to me

930
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,020
by 1 o'clock tonight.

931
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,150
You want it tonight?

932
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,810
Forget it if you have no money.

933
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,950
No! Wait!

934
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,950
I'll get it.

935
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,460
I gathered all the silver ingots

936
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,110
in the shop and at home.

937
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,190
It was just enough.

938
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:35,710
I couldn't wait

939
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,600
to return to the burial goods store to make the deal.

940
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,680
But when I thought of what Dugu Yang said

941
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,240
about meeting at 1 o'clock,

942
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,650
I was afraid that arriving too early

943
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,890
would give him an excuse not to sell to me.

944
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,420
So I had to endure it.

945
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,910
I was about to finally get the treasure

946
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,290
I've been longing for half a lifetime.

947
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,340
I was so happy about it.

948
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,180
When the time came,

949
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,880
the rain had also stopped.

950
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,700
When I hurried to the burial goods store,

951
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,020
I found that the lights were off.

952
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,510
What a despicable coroner.

953
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,450
How dare you fool me?

954
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,900
It makes no sense.

955
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,550
Dugu Yang?

956
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,020
Dugu Yang?

957
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,930
I didn't report it to the authorities

958
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,800
because I was afraid suspicion would fall on me.

959
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,810
You're in court now.

960
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,290
Did you tell the truth?

961
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,190
Every antique in Treasure Pavilion

962
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,350
is genuine.

963
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,420
Every word I have said

964
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,310
is true.
