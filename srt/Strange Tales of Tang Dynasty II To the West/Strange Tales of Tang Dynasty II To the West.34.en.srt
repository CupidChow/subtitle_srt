What else do you want to inquire about?

7
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,670
There's nothing to inquire about today.

8
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,230
The murder case has been solved.

9
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm here to tell you,

Who is the murderer?

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,550
It was Chu Bin's wandering soul that committed the murder.

18
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,230
I, as the sheriff, only arrest mortal criminals.

19
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,350

All I did was take a bit of money.

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,280
It's already unlucky enough

40
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,830
for me to be met with a dead person.

41

They're saying that there is no corpse in the coffin

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,640
because it has long turned into a ghost.

In this journey to the west,

00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,070
we've been through many hardships.

131
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,750
But we've never encountered

132
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,150
such a strange case.

133
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:39,110
Although the identity of the woman in the veil has been exposed,

134
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,390
there is no evidence

135
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,150
to prove her as the murderer.

136
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,620
What we need to do now

137
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,710
is to bring this case back from being a "records of anomalies"

138
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,500
to the mortal world.

139
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,230
I can only make one more

140
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,620
deduction without any evidence,

141
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,420
and that is...

00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,840
this ugly woman

143
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,070
doesn't exist at all.

144
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,910
If that's the case,

145
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,230
Ms. Yin must have lied.

146
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,830
So did Mudan.

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,630
be it her name is Lin Bei or Chu Bin,

149
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,430
not a single word of her testimony is credible.

150
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,590
Also,

and the maid Chang Le,

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,100
are also suspects.

154
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,970
There are five suspects in total.

155
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,350
Time is tight.

156
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,390
Each of us

157
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,880
will take on one of them.

158

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,650
what should we do?

Attack their minds.

161
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,800
All right, all right.

162

You can leave after reading it.

163
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,390
You really won't let me take your pulse?

164
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,430
I didn't say I wanted to see a doctor.

165
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,400
You may go now.

167
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,870
Have you not slept for a

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,150
whole day and night?

169
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,280
In the past few years,

170
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,520
you have been continuously

171
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,550
taking medicine.

172
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,910
No.

173
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,890
Then someone must have

174
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,210
put it in your food.

175
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,280
Judging from your expression,

176
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,920
you probably already know

177
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,410
that you've been drugged.

178
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,390
This drug makes you dizzy,

179
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,110
your limbs weak,

180
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,030
restless,

181
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,710
emotionally unstable,

182
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,710
your speech feeble,

183
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,430
and your legs heavy.

184
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,310
Once you take the medicine, you fall into a deep sleep,

185
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,810
but once you wake up, you can hardly fall asleep again.

186
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,580
Unless,

187
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,790
you take this drug again.

188
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,390
How do you know?

189
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,470
I have cured cases of

when I was in my teens.

192
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,510
Now I run the Yunding Clinic.

193
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,070
My surname is Fei, given name Qiao, and courtesy name is Yingjun.

194
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,730
I'm also known as Chicken Fed.

195
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,550
I've heard of you.

196
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
I've heard of you.

197
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,720
You've cured many mute slaves.

198
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,510
I was just thinking

199
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,240
of coming to see you these days.

200
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,150
Greetings, Ms. Chu.

201
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,400
I am not surnamed Chu,

202
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,750
but Lin.

203
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,590
My family lives in

204
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,110
Beimang Mountain, on the outskirts of Luoyang.

205
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,370
I heard you are Detective Di's disciple.

206
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,720
Your master's tomb is not far from my home.

207
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,870
I respect Detective Di for serving the country and the people.

208
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,150
Every year during the Cold Food Festival,

209
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,750
I would visit his tomb and pay my respects.

210
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,480
In that case,

211
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,350
I shall thank Ms. Chu on behalf of my master.

212
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,630
It's Ms. Lin.

213
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,920
All right.

214
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,870
Ms. Lin.

215
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,010
You already know my background,

216
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,890
but I know

217
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,110
almost nothing about you.

218
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,310
I only heard that

219
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,120
you are a master of many skills

220
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,390
and can imitate the deceased.

221
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,790
I think

222
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,890
if one cannot communicate with the souls of the dead,

223
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,950
I'm afraid it would be

224
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,950
impossible to imitate them so well.

225
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,690
Ms. Lin,

226
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,080
since you can imitate Chu Bin,

227
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,110
you must know her very well

228
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,750
and know of her past,

229
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,270
right?

230
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,430
To be honest,

231
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,590
I sympathize with this lady very much.

232
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,710
Especially after I saw the letter

233
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,350
she wrote to Li Men.

234
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,110
Between the lines,

235
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,440
it was filled with blood and tears.

236
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,310
Ms. Lin,

237
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,520
could you tell me

238
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,550
Chu Bin's story?

239
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,740
Shopkeeper.

240
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
Isn't it just copying the names of medicines?

241
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,470
I can do it.

242
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,240
I have studied before.

243
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,790
Why don't you just give me the money?

244
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,830
There's no need to hire anyone else.

245
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,510
Excuse me.

246
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,000
Is your shop in need of someone to do some writing?

247
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,390
If it weren't for the decline of her family,

248
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,460
Chu Bin would not have

249
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,060
gone out to write for others.

250
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,590
The first time she did it was at that drug shop.

251
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,790
The drug shop's business was very poor.

252
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,670
But ever since Chu Bin

253
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,480
helped copy the drug names,

254
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,430
business started to pick up.

255
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,310
Many scholars and literati

256
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,770
went there to get medicine

257
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,790
just to see the elegant handwriting

258
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,230
on the medicine cabinet.

259
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,390
Chu Bin also became famous because of this

260
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,650
and wrote everywhere.

261
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,690
As for Li Yun,

262
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,430
he no longer worked as an apprentice at the drug shop

263
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,830
and ground ink for her instead.

264
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,100
I've seen Chu Bin's handwriting.

265
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,830
It has both the vigor of a nobel,

266
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,710
and carries an innate gentle elegance.

267
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,070
It's truly remarkable.

268
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,080
Li Yun was good with his hands.

269
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,260
In the winter, he personally made a cotton coat for Chu Bin.

270
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,570
He even embroidered a plum blossom on it.

271
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,140
Chu Bin has a weak body,

272
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,500
so Li Yun would stew soup for her to drink.

273
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,190
After all, he had been an apprentice at the drug shop.

274
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,910
He stewed the soup with medicinal ingredients

275
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,310
which was both delicious

276
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,320
and nourishing.

277
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,350
Later on,

278
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,230
the two of them secretly pledged to spend their lives together

279
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,890
and decided to return to Yunding to get married.

280
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,630
However, there weren't a lot of

281
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,940
writing jobs in Yunding.

282
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,940
So Chu Bin could only persuade Li Yun

283
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,360
to go out and find some way to make a living.

284
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,830
Their classmate Fang Jiong introduced

285
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,050
Li Yun to Yunding's

286
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,380
most famous fabric shop

287
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,520
to be an apprentice.

288
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,560
Before long,

289
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,950
Chu Bin discovered that something was wrong.

290
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,590
Didn't you say

291
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,710
you would marry me after taking me back to your hometown?

292
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,270
But now,

293
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,190
why are you entangled with that woman

294
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,390
from the fabric shop?

295
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,150
What do you mean by entangled?

296
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,740
I'm just learning the craft.

297
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,340
Going on a trip to the outskirts with that woman

298
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,800
is also part of learning the craft?

299
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,550
You're following me.

300
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,880
Chu Bin had never followed him.

301
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,240
It's just that Li Yun forgot

302
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,070
that Fang Jiong knows Chu Bin.

303
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,520
Fang Jiong was in a lot of pain at that time.

304
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,350
The Fang family had already proposed marriage.

305
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,810
But the Shen family went back on their words.

306
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,670
Li Yun's

307
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,400
tailoring skills were superb,

308
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,750
and is willing to marry into the family.

309
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,100
This way,

310
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,310
the fabric shop would have a successor.

311
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,910
But the most important thing was...

312
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,380
Shen Ping

313
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,600
liked Li Yun.

314
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,110
From tomorrow on,

315
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,100
I will no longer go to Shen's fabric shop.

316
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,720
After all these things,

317
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,970
I realized that you are still the one I love the most.

318
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,830
You really won't

319
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,760
associate with Shen Ping anymore?

320
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,510
Chu Bin.

321
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,880
I have almost mastered the craft.

322
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,120
I will go to the pawnshop

323
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,730
to borrow some silver.

324
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,730
Let's open a cloth shop together.

325
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,590
You and I can run it together.

326
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,790
We will definitely have a good life in the future.

327
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,590
That day

328
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,870
was the happiest

329
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,290
and also the most miserable day

330
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,270
since Chu Bin arrived at Yunding.

331
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,190
Li Yun made her a bowl of

332
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,470
mixed fruit tea.

333
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,390
Here.

334
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,000
This tea smells so good.

335
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,440
It will

336
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:05,910
improve your

337
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,710
complexion.

338
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,349
Thank you, Honey.

339
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,950
Not long after drinking the tea,

340
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,710
Chu Bin felt dizzy.

341
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,880
Li Yun's expression turned sinister.

342
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,990
He said to Chu Bin...

343
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,850
Are you feeling dizzy?

344
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,280
Then go to sleep.

345
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,460
I found you a new house.

346
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,250
We'll be there soon

347
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,230
You can have a

348
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,750
a good sleep there.

349
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,960
Forever.

350
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,920
The house...

351
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,540
It was until

352
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,400
when she woke up in the dark,

353
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,480
Chu Bin realized,

354
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,800
the new house that Li Yun mentioned

355
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,030
was actually

356
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,030
a coffin.

357
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,430
How could such a beast exist in this world!

358
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,870
Ms. Lin.

359
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,080
If you meet Chu Bin's soul again,

360
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,150
please convey a message for me:

361
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,990
"This beast

362
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,640
shall be executed."

363
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,470
Su Wuming,

364
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,710
I heard you assisted Lu Lingfeng

365
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,060
in destroying the Yunding Immortal Steps

366
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,790
and solved many bizarre cases.

367
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,320
I know you didn't come today

368
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,090
just to hear my story.

369
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,690
For what you said just now,

370
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,280
I shall thank you on behalf of Chu Bin.

371
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,430
I was going to

372
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,890
tell you everything

373
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,870
to put an end to the past.

374
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,150
But

375
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,010
using Chu Jia to lure me

376
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,960
was inappropriate.

377
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,110
So you admit that you are indeed Chu Bin?

378
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,670
Chu Bin is dead.

379
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,310
In this world,

380
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,130
there is only Lin Bei left.

381
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,150
If that's the case,

382
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,990
then you still haven't

383
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,080
walked out from the shadows

384
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,310
of 10 years ago.

385
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,510
Li Yun not only betrayed Chu Bin,

386
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,350
but also killed someone with poison!

387
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,670
Such a beast

388
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,630
has no right

389
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,240
to take away half of Chu Bin's life!

390
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,550
Lin Bei...

391
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,190
is half of Chu Bin.

392
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,190
The first time I heard you say

393
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,510
this name,

394
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,350
it occured to me.

395
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,950
Now, I am

396
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,910
assisting the Sheriff of Yunding County

397
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,350
in investigating murder cases

398
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,010
and seeking the real culprit.

399
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,400
If you were involved in the murder,

400
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,950
no matter if your name is Chu Bin

401
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,430
or Lin Bei,

402
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,170
you won't escape the law.

403
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,790
If you didn't commit murder,

404
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,150
even if you are Chu Bin,

405
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,870
you can still

406
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,110
walk out with your head held high

407
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,710
and start a new life.

408
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,220
Go experience and savor

409
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,990
the prosperity of this great era.

410
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,270
Yunding of the Great Tang

411
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,430
belongs to the Emperor of Tang...

412
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,150
And even more so to the people of Tang.

413
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,480
Miss.

414
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,550
Go back.

415
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,470
I'm too old to kill anyone.

416
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,640
Keeping an eye on me is useless.

417
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,450
But I have killed before.

418
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,550
I'm a woman who travels across the martial world.

419
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,080
When I encounter villains,

420
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,550
of course I have to

421
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,670
kill them to protect myself.

422
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,910
How could you

423
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,400
work at the government office

424
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,590
then?

425
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,990
I am not from the government office.

426
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,930
Before my father passed away,

427
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,920
he entrusted me to someone.

428
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,590
I'm just following that person.

429
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,070
You're also an ill-fated lady...

430
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,550
Also?

431
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,770
Ms. Yin, have you met

432
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,310
other ill-fated lady?

433
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,310
I have.

434
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,680
That lady

435
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,920
suffered much more than you...

436
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,430
Look at them, how can they

437
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,590
work so carelessly?

438
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,980
You have to supervise them.

439
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,630
The coffin is even placed crookedly.

440
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,830
This is disrespectful to the deceased.

441
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,480
Whatever.

442
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,400
Hurry up and bury it!

443
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,530
It'll be more troublesome if it rains!

444
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,930
After you finish burying, burn some paper money for me.

445
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,610
That won't do.

446
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,980
The deceased is your wife.

447
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,590
You have to burn

448
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,800
this paper money yourself.

449
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,510
Can't you see

450
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,710
it's about to rain?

451
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,150
I'll give you some more tip.

452
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,510
Hey!

453
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,760
Alright,

454
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,190
let's take shelter for a while.

455
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,230
He has left anyway.

456
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,350
We can come back when the rain stops.

457
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,830
Let's go!

458
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,710
Okay, okay!

459
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,790
Let's go, let's go.

460
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,630
How can you work like this?

461
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,810
You can't leave!

462
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,070
You can't!

463
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,200
I've been selling joss paper for so many years...

464
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
but I've never encountered a ghost.

465
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,160
So I'm not afraid of ghosts either.

466
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,160
Mustering up my courage,

467
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,710
I pried open the coffin

468
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,630
only to see her inside...

469
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,750
She's a beautiful lady.

470
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,950
A lady

471
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,850
no family nor relatives in Yunding.

472
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,430
It was Chu Bin...

473
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,730
She wasn't dead at all.

474
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,750
Don't try to set a trap for me.

475
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,030
I didn't say she was Chu Bin.

476
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,750
Ms. Yin.

477
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,550
Back then, you only sold joss paper,

478
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,240
and haven't opened Biluo Inn, right?

479
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,040
That's right.

480
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,270
I guess

481
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,700
the inn is newly opened.

482
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,990
It hasn't been more than half a year.

483
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,470
How did you guess that?

484
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,070
I drank the two bowls of medicine just now.

485
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,600
I feel much better already.

486
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,910
I feel energetic all over.

487
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,990
Would it be fine to drink

488
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,470
three bowls of this a day?

489
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,200
Three bowls?

490
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,480
That's too little.

491
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,990
You've been poisoned with a slow poison

492
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,390
for at least three years.

493
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,710
The poisoned

494
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,340
will need strong medicine to counteract it.

495
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,470
After this bowl, there are three more.

496
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,030
Six bowls a day,

497
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,470
for a whole month.

498
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,070
Okay.

499
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,130
I'll follow your instructions, Physician.

500
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,040
Wait a moment.

501
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,600
It's hot.

502
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,320
Let it cool for a bit.

503
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,440
Madam...

504
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,070
Who poisoned you?

505
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,630
You should have an idea, right?

506
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,300
I do.

507
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,630
Dad.

508
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:02,870
Dad.

509
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,520
I brought you your meal.

510
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,630
Ping'er.

511
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,990
Starting from tomorrow,

512
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,390
when you bring me my meal,

513
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,790
bring an extra portion.

514
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,850
It should be exactly the same as mine.

515
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,510
Who is it for?

516
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:15,950
Li Yun.

517
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,220
I have been waiting for so many years,

518
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,540
and finally, I found a tailoring genius

519
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,630
in Yunding.

520
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,310
Greetings, my lady.

521
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,630
Li Yun.

522
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,630
Is the beef tasty today?

523
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,580
Did you cook it yourself?

524
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,710
I did!

525
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,740
It's not good.

526
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,750
I have offended you greatly.

527
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,650
Please forgive me, my lady.

528
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,230
He was always cold

529
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,390
never tried to please me.

530
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,270
But sometimes,

531
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,450
he would suddenly make me feel

532
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,170
that he had long treated me

533
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,770
as the closest person to him.

534
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,570
This is not right.

535
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,760
I plucked up my courage

536
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,370
and asked him out for an outing...

537
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,840
but he rejected me three times in a row.

538
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,190
Only after some discreet inquiries did I find out,

539
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,090
that there was a woman by his side.

540
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,790
I was heartbroken.

541
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,330
If your tears fall into the soup,

542
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,730
then it won't taste good.

543
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,770
Actually, to make a delicious soup,

544
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,330
we need to add some fresh medicinal herbs

545
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,330
and wild flowers.

546
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,570
Master has approved my day off tomorrow.

547
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,320
Shall we go collect them in the suburbs together?

548
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,270
In the suburbs,

549
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,750
I asked him if he's going to marry

550
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,310
that woman named Chu Bin.

551
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,630
Surprisingly, he cried.

552
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,670
What?

553
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,300
She's going to die soon?

554
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,860
Yes...

555
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,820
She once had feelings for me,

556
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,410
and traveled from Dongdu to Yunding with me.

557
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,380
How can I bear to leave her now?

558
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,220
I can only let you down

559
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,580
for the affection you have towards me.

560
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,830
What a man of great love and righteousness.

561
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,560
I swore right then and there

562
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,710
that I would wait for him.

563
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,240
It was also around that time

564
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,310
the Fang family came to propose marriage.

565
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,510
I flatly refused.

566
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,210
Not long after,

567
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,960
I received the news of Chu Bin's death.

568
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,010
After that day,

569
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,150
Li Yun refused to see me.

570
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,200
It made me feel even more

571
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,070
that this man

572
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,850
was worth waiting for.

573
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,510
I lost my appetite

574
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,210
and even refused to speak.

575
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,360
In my heart, I only thought,

576
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,240
if I couldn't marry Li Yun in this life,

577
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,450
I would rather die.

578
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,850
My father saw through my thoughts

579
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,750
and actually went to propose marriage himself.,

580
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,880
with the fabric shop

581
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,710
and all our family assets

582
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,990
as my dowry.

583
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,720
He begged Li Yun to come out of his grief

584
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,430
and marry me, this poor lovesick girl.

585
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,830
What a move of playing hard to get!

586
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,870
So...

587
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,030
the Shen family fabric shop

588
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,230
became the current

589
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,870
Tianyi Fabric Shop.

590
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,510
Yes.

591
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,270
It's not too hot anymore,

592
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:51,800
drink up.

593
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,470
Your medicine is bitter.

594
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,440
The medicinal meals he gave me

595
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,590
were all fragrant and sweet.

596
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,630
Here.

597
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,150
Why aren't you drinking it?

598
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,680
This soup is good for women.

599
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,570
It's especially effective for treating weakness.

600
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,750
I don't know when it started,

601
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,390
but I became drowsy and lethargic.

602
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,410
It was only later that I found out,

603
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,200
whenever I fell asleep,

604
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,190
he would go out.

605
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,400
He was skilled at tailoring

606
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,570
and there were often women

607
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,710
who would ask him to make clothes for them at night.

[Mudan Lime Shop]

609
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,950
Sheriff Lu,

610
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,670
you're a descendant of a noble family, handsome and suave.

611
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,110
Even if you come to my place in broad daylight,

612
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,790
it still makes

613
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,030
my heart bloom with joy.

614
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,690
You forgot your promise to me.

615
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,970
I asked around.

616
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,150
Your parents

617
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,750
have only you, one daughter.

618
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,090
They see you as the apple of their eye.

619
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,030
Why do you mention my parents, Sheriff Lu?

620
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,630
You feel sorry towards them.

621
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,660
The fabric must be carefully selected.

622
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,260
The tailoring is even more important.

623
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,580
You have such a great figure,

624
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,990
I, the owner of this shop, can make it for you personally.

625
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,430
My...

626
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,550
My figure is good?

627
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:34,990
Am I not fat?

628
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,880
Those who say you are fat

629
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,950
simply don't know how to appreciate your beauty.

630
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,750
You don't need to listen to them.

631
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,830
Really?

632
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,550
In just a couple of days,

633
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,410
the sample garment was finished.

634
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,240
It was too loose on me.

635
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,030
He said the measurements were not accurate enough,

636
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,890
so I let him take my measurements.

637
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,350
He measured...

638
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,320
so meticulously...

639
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,430
That was my...

640
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,580
That was my first time.

641
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,350
From then on,

642
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,510
I fell madly in love with him.

643
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,990
I wished to meet him

644
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,250
in secret every night.

645
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,010
Even though I knew he was married,

646
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,690
I still couldn't control myself.

647
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,010
Soon after,

648
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,950
I found there was something odd

649
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,750
with my tummy.

650
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,470
Mine?

651
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,140
How can you prove it?

652
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,990
Why don't you give birth to the baby first?

653
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,670
If the baby really looks like me,

654
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,110
then I will acknowledge it.

655
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,100
But Shen Ping

656
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,190
will not allow me to take a concubine.

657
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,320
You'd better live outside.

658
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,950
I have never been married.

659
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,620
I didn't dare to give birth to the child.

660
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,150
I could only, behind my parents' back

661
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,870
begged a wandering doctor in the martial world

662
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,930
to help me abort it.

663
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,750
But Yunding is a small place.

664
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,520
How could I keep it a secret?

665
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,680
My father

666
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,610
was angered to death by me.

667
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,430
My mother

668
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,110
also killed herself in the well.

669
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,830
My relatives scolded me.

670
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,870
Neighbors pointed fingers at me

671
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,300
behind my back.

672
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,320
From then on,

673
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,810
I became a bad woman

674
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,690
to everyone.

675
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,370
Then I might as well be bad.

676
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,070
Anyway, there won't be

677
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,400
anyone proposing to me.

678
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,590
Sheriff Lu,

679
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,660
when you entered my house just now,

680
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,860
no one saw you, right?

681
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,330
You must be careful

682
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,040
not to let others gossip.

683
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,550
Later on,

684
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,670
did you go to see Li Yun again?

685
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,400
I did.

686
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,630
I'm cheap.

687
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,560
I can't forget him.

688
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,270
I even sneaked into the fabric shop

689
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,610
in the middle of the night.

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,560
Thank you, Master.

I was born into an official's family.

716
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,230
But my father committed a capital crime

717
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,389
so I was enslaved.

It was Madam who bought me.

Yet, Master treated me so well.

Master,

727
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,610
do you need more hot water?

728
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,280
Yes.

729
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,730
I'm sorry, Master!

730
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,670
I scalded you...

731
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,830
It's no big deal.

Why are you kneeling?

733
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,310
Get up.

734
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,400
Does the garment fit well?

735
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,150
It fits well.

736
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,480
How come I feel it's a bit loose?

737

You belong to me.

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,600
it'd be the hallmark of Tianyi Fabric Shop.

00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,570
Come in.

741
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,080
Let me take your measurements again.

742
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,040
I'll alter it until it fits perfectly.

743
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,060
I was scared to death.

744
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,050
Afraid that Madam would find out.

745
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,030
But he said

746
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,510
Madam won't wake up when she's asleep.

747
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,870
After a long time,

748
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,790
I finally realized

749
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,290
the soup Madam drank

750
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,150
was always simmered separately.

751
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,270
Are you saying...

752
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,320
Li Yun has been poisoning Shen Ping all along?

753
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,630
I don't know if it counts as poison.

754
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,030
It's just that

755
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,580
Madam was getting weaker by the day.

756
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,190
Also,

00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,310
once she fell asleep, she couldn't wake up.

758
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,750
She kept having nightmares

759
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,700
but when she woke up,

760
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,750
if she didn't drink the soup,

761
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,550
she can never fall asleep again.

762
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,070
Master...

763
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,070
We shouldn't

764
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,430
do this anymore.

765
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,470
Why not?

766
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:52,980
I like you.

767
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:53,910
But Madam...

768
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,940
She's dying.

769
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,190
You will be the Madam in the future.

770
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,400
I deserve to die.

771
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,920
I actually dreamed of being the madam of the house.

772
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
I waited for his summon every night,

773
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,470
but he still went out often.

774
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,470
Once,

775
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,320
I plucked up the courage to follow him.

776
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,360
[Anyuan Inn]

777
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,800
Li Yun.

778
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,350
When will you

779
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,950
come to Hanzhou and marry me?

780
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,130
Shen Ping is seriously ill

781
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,810
and will not live long.

782
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,720
She married me when I was down and out.

783
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,440
How can I bear to

784
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,510
abandon her now?

785
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,110
I can only let

786
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,280
your affection for me down.

787
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,080
Even if your father sends someone to kill me,

788
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,540
I will have no regrets.

789
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,150
I won't

790
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,080
force you anymore.

791
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,720
No matter how long, I will wait for you.

792
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,510
I overheard that.

793
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,390
Ms. Tian

794
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,610
was the most beloved daughter of

795
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,670
the wealthiest merchant in Hanzhou.

796
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,100
Her father has already agreed

797
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,760
to offer his entire family fortune as her dowry.

798
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,480
From today onwards,

799
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,920
add two more pieces of this medicinal ingredient

800
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,550
to the Madam's daily dosage.

801
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,540
Yes.

802
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,530
The Madam's health

803
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,130
is deteriorating day by day.

804
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,850
You must take good care of her.

805
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,950
When she passes away,

806
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,290
you will become the new Madam.

807
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,510
I dare not think that way.

808
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,030
You, young lady,

809
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,250
have great fortune awaiting you.

810
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,510
Since then,

811
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,870
I found that

812
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,570
Madam slept more deeply,

813
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,650
woke up later,

814
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,240
and her body got weaker.

815
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,640
I thought...

816
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,970
if this continues,

817
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,700
I will cause the death of Madam.

818
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,590
So,

819
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,690
you told Shen Ping everything

820
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,330
and planned to–

821
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,310
No!

822
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,390
I see Dade treats you quite well too.

823
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,310
Yes.

824
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,870
I'm a shameless person.

825
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,300
I failed to seduce my master,

826
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,230
so I could only seduce the servant.

827
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,720
Is this against the law?

828
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,960
Lu Lingfeng.

829
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,430
It seems we are the same.

830
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,570
We can only get a breakthrough confession

831
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,380
from Li Men.

832
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,630
I don't hold much hope.

833
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,270
I just want to verify my guess.

834
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,070
The candlestick that was used to hid him was on the first floor?

835
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,600
I guess I remembered wrong.

836
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,350
Put away your

837
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,390
frivolous look.

838
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,190
If you don't confess,

839
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,950
aren't you afraid that I'll conclude you as the murderer?

840
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,630
Very well.

841
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,390
If someone must

842
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,050
pay with their life for Li Yun,

843
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,620
then let it be me.

844
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,360
I'm done asking.

845
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,570
It's your turn.

846
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,280
I have nothing to ask.

847
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,030
Sheriff Lu.

848
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,830
There are still several hundred people gathered outside the county government.

849
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,710
Even Magistrate Huangfu can't...

850
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,790
can't go home.

851
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,360
He specifically asked me to come and inquire

852
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,510
if the murderer can be identified,

853
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,030
or... if there really is a ghost killing people.

854
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,070
Officer Suo!

855
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,350
I mean.

856
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,230
Well...

857
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,000
Please do me a favor

858
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,320
and go back first.

859
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,110
Allow Sheriff Lu and Mr. Su

860
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,270
to think over it.

861
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,920
Lu Lingfeng.

862
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,830
You are the sheriff.

863
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,550
Su Wuming,

864
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,490
you usually talk the most.

865
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,990
About today's matter,

866
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,190
which one of you two is going to speak up?

867
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,870
I'll speak!

868
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,440
Although Changle didn't admit it,

869
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,510
I suspect

870
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,090
that she participated in the action.

871
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,680
If I were the arresting officer,

872
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,670
I wouldn't pursue it.

873
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:08,800
Lu Lingfeng.

874
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,880
If you find Changle guilty,

875
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,070
I will leave Yunding immediately

876
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,400
and return to Chang'an.

877
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,470
In this lifetime,

878
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,210
I will never see you again.

879
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,340
Let me speak instead.

880
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,870
Allow me to

881
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
speculate without any evidence again.
