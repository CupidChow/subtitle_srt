00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,670
Let me down.

6
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,550
Let me down.

7
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,560
Let me down!

8
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,330
Lu Lingfeng!

9
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,230
Your Highness.

10
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,200
Let me down.

11
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,470
I want to pay my respects to Your Highness.

12
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,330
Forget about these formalities.

13
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,410
Send General Lu

14
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,600
to the study.

15
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,110
Yes.

16
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,300
Guo Zhuang.

17
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,130
I'm not familiar with him,

18
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,200
but since he was once an Imperial Guard

19
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,030
and followed Lu Tong,

20
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,030
he's a meritorious minister

21
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,430
who helped me eliminate Queen Wei's party.

22
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,350
To think it'd end up like this.

23
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,230
Guo Zhuang was killed

24
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,680
because I fell

25
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,030
into a thief's trap.

26
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,360
Please punish me, Your Highness.

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,630
Get up.

28
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,630
You're seriously injured.

29
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,780
You must've done your best.

30
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,840
That's not a crime.

31
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,960
Lu Lingfeng.

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,070
Do you know that these days,

33
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,060
His Highness couldn't sleep or eat

34
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,540
because of you?

35
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,320
Don't tell him that.

36
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,350
I didn't eat because I have no appetite.

37
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,550
This Ghost Market...

38
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,150
I'm willing to lead the elites

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,110
to subdue Ghost Market.

40
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,170
Then there won't be

41
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,930
a place outside the law in Chang'an.

42
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,270
The Mara doesn't just kill

43
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,070
and take livers in Ghost Market.

44
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,570
I heard that

45
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,610
there are many who rely on Ghost Market

46
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,540
to make a living.

47
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,390
Though many are refugees,

48
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,700
they are still the people of Tang after all.

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,870
The court should find a way

50
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,100
to manage it

51
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,370
and take care of it.

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,310
Your Highness is broad-minded,

53
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,310
serving the country and the people.

54
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,450
What are you doing now?

55
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,150
Your Highness, please give the order

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,329
to get rid of the Mara's Defeat mural in Chengfo Temple.

57
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:39,829
This...

58
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,270
A few days ago,

59
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,910
Kong Mao's father

60
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,640
took people to Chengfo Temple.

61
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,910
They failed to remove the mural

62
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,170
and even got scolded by

63
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,430
people from the Princess' Palace

64
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,829
and had his salary confiscated.

65
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,440
Administrator Du Ming of Yongzhou

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,350
was ordered to send troops to Chengfo Temple

67
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,350
to protect the mural.

68
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,910
I received an invitation

69
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,430
from my aunt to unveil

70
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,230
the greatest

71
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,800
mural of Tang with her

72
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,310
on Mingyin Festival.

73
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,110
Tell me. How can we remove the mural?

74
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,730
It must be removed.

75
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,510
Did you...

76
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,110
really meet Mara

77
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,769
who came out of the mural in Ghost Market?

78
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,480
Regardless whether

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,010
Mara broke out of the mural,

80
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,290
they must be related.

81
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,630
Remove the mural

82
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,230
for peace in Chang'an.

83
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,250
You're badly injured.

84
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,350
Let me send you back

85
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,110
to rest.

86
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,260
Your Highness, please give the order to remove the mural.

87
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,990
Lu Lingfeng!

88
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,210
You're putting

89
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,530
His Highness in a difficult spot.

90
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,130

91
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,730

92
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,710
Let me ask you.

93
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,480
Who was here?

94
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,909
Who took away my investigation journal?

95
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,830
Mr. Su.

96
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,070
What Mr. Su?

97
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm Su Wuming.

98
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,190
Senior.

99
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,350
Junior.

100
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,030
People say

101
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,680
if you survive a great disaster, you will be blessed.

102
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,960
You must pull yourself together as soon as possible.

103
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,909
Senior.

104
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,960
Why are you back in the capital?

105
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,670
I'm the new

106
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,100
Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

107
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,659
Acting Deputy President.

108
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,909
Su Wuming!

109
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,320
Su Wuming!

110
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,600
You young one.

111
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,570
You run faster than me.

112
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,410
Lu Lingfeng.

113
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,270
I just put lesser incense

114
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,670
and you woke up!

115
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,330
Let me tell you.

116
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,190
My treatment for you this time

117
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,280
is very special.

118
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,610
It's mainly

119
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,090
to restore your vitality.

120
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,030
You're a martial artist.

121
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,750
If you don't

122
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,150
fully recover this time,

123
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,270
you can't even beat others in fighting.

124
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,070
Fei!

125
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,730
Why did you lie to me

126
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,950
about Guo Zhuang?

127
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,530
Well...

128
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,030
Let go.

129
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,110
Let go!

130
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,310
Let go!

131
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,190
Fei saved your life.

132
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,830
Why are you blaming him?

133
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,550
Exactly.

134
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,750
Give me the investigation journal.

135
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,310
I need to solve this case as soon as possible.

136
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,100
Enough.

137
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,070
Focus on recuperating now

138
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,950
instead of

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,480
investigating.

140
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,110
Give me ten days.

141
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,880
Well...

142
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,520
Eight days will do too.

143
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,920
As long as you listen to me,

144
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,510
I guarantee your health will be as good as before.

145
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,190
Shut up!

146
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,410
Get out.

147
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,350
I won't...

148
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,510
Fei's right.

149
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,470
Right now,

150
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,390
your recuperation is key.

151
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,040
Because of this case,

152
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,710
I was transferred back to the capital.

153
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,190
To be promoted to

154
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,590
Deputy President,

155
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,380
I must earn merits

156
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,910
with this case.

157
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,630
How about

158
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,710
you give this case to me?

159
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,320
Mr. Lu, please help me.

160
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,690
Give me the investigation journal.

161
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,350
Hurry up and send it to me.

162
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,630
You two became major officials

163
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,790
all of a sudden.

164
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,710
Why are you

165
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,900
even rivals?

166
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,590
We haven't seen each other for months.

167
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,230
You didn't even prepare a jar of wine

168
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,560
and two chickens for me.

169
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,110
Princess.

170
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,070
Where are you going?

171
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,710
Lu Lingfeng had been missing for days.

172
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,170
I heard it was a close call.

173
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,510
I'll go check on him.

174
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,140
No way.

175
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,270
Lu Lingfeng went straight to Eastern Palace last night.

176
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,190
I heard the Crown Prince welcomed him in the rain.

177
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,070
He is the trusted subordinate of Eastern Palace.

178
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,850
So what?

179
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,830
Lu Lingfeng's disappearance

180
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,550
might've been Eastern Palace's plan.

181
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,910
Now that you and Crown Prince are at odds,

182
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,840
there will be a war sooner or later.

183
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,310
I've received the report.

184
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,190
They are planning

185
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,220
to attack you.

186
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,230
Aren't you allowing them to do so

187
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,870
by going to the Supreme Court now?

188
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,550
Enough.

189
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,870
I don't want to listen to you.

190
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,450
Then...

191
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,770
you need to be protected by guards and horses.

192
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,740
No need.

193
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,910
Princess!

194
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,920
Didn't you transfer me here

195
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,330
to plot something big?

196
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,390
Always be careful.

197
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,030
You taught me that.

198
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,720
Fine.

199
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,610
I'll have some tea.

200
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,850
Help me prepare quickly.

201
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,910
Princess.

202
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,790
I'll say one more thing.

203
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,390
Lu Lingfeng

204
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,320
didn't solve the case well.

205
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,350
Why don't you take this chance

206
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,600
to cut off the wings of the Eastern Palace

207
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,860
and kill him to prevent future troubles?

208
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,590
It hurts so much.

209
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,390
You...

210
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,910
Slap yourself

211
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,020
until I come back.

212
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:41,330
[Supreme Court]

213
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

214
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,790
Where is Lu Lingfeng?

215
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,150
I-I don't know.

216
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,110
Su Wuming.

217
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,870
He's badly injured.

218
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,630
Shouldn't you be by his side?

219
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,550
I...

220
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,820
Your Highness.

221
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,680
Mr. Lu is seriously injured,

222
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,880
but he should be fine.

223
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,990
An hour ago,

224
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,430
I saw him with his armor and spear

225
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,330
riding a horse.

226
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,430
I really admire

227
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,500
his majestic aura.

228
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,660
Where can he go when he's seriously injured?

229
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,510
Princess.

230
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,140
I think I know

231
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,270
where he went.

232
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,190
[Chengfo Temple]

233
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,510
You can't enter the temple with a spear.

234
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,110
Step aside.

235
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,630
Soldiers of Yongzhou Government

236
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,020
are ordered to guard Chengfo Temple.

237
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,220
No one is allowed to enter with weapons.

238
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,300
Please step back.

239
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,280
Get out of the way!

240
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,600
I, Lu Lingfeng, will remove the mural

241
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,860
to suppress the demon.

242
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,590
If it's a crime,

243
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,340
I'll take the responsibility.

244
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,950
It has nothing to do with you.

245
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,750
Move back!

246
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,320
Try to stop me

247
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,150
and meet my spear.

248
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,650
Qin Xiaobai?

249
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,530
Move!

250
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,750
Lu Lingfeng.

251
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,750
Why do you want to

252
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,560
destroy my Mara's Defeat?

253
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,030
If you weren't arrogant

254
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,790
and claimed Mara would break out of the mural,

255
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,630
Chang'an's people

256
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,020
wouldn't be in panic.

257
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,780
If you don't move,

258
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,600
I'll kill you

259
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,360
with my spear.

260
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,110
I, Qin Xiaobai,

261
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,080
haven't made the finishing touch.

262
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,940
It's agonizing.

263
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,030
I just want to die.

264
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,150
Come on.

265
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
You're from the Lu family of Fanyang

266
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,150
and the former general of the Imperial Guards.

267
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,830
For Chang'an black tea and Sky-scraping Tower,

268
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,320
you were involved.

269
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,740
You can be considered a big shot.

270
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,050
I can make do with you being

271
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,430
my executioner.

272
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,440
Come on.

273
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,670
It’s my destiny

274
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,950
to die in front of the mural.

275
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,750
Fine.

276
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,790
In that case,

277
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,590
I'll grant your wish.

278
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,910
Stop!

279
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,920
Lu Lingfeng.

280
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,260
Don't you know

281
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,720
murder is a capital crime?

282
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,570
If I can destroy the mural,

283
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,770
what's with a death?

284
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,880
Lu Lingfeng.

285
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,710
Great.

286
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,670
You're back.

287
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,550
Are you hurt badly?

288
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,830
What are you doing?

289
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,870
Qin Xiaobai was hired by me.

290
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,770
Why do you want to kill him?

291
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,070
There is law in Tang.

292
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,810
If you stab him,

293
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,660
even I can't save you.

294
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,230
He's timid.

295
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,960
Lu Lingfeng.

296
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,850
Is your valiant body a decoration?

297
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,490
Come on.

298
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,310
With your spear,

299
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,280
stab my throat

300
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,240
and let my blood

301
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,590
splash on this mural,

302
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,990
and I'll be remembered forever.

303
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,720
Qin Xiaobai.

304
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,230
You’re famous.

305
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,390
How dare you drink so much?

306
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,520
How inappropriate!

307
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,360
Guards!

308
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,070
Take him out!

309
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,870
Princess.

310
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,680
Princess!

311
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,610
Princess!

312
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,400
Please let Lu Lingfeng kill me!

313
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,870
Shut his mouth.

314
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,020
I don't want to listen to his nonsense.

315
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,480
Lu Lingfeng.

316
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,810
Pay your respects.

317
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,710
I'm Lu Lingfeng, Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

318
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

319
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,990
I’ll wait outside.

320
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,310
Tell me where you are hurt.

321
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,050
I was so worried these days.

322
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:40,870
I thought

323
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,330
I'd never see my son again.

324
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,810
Your Highness.

325
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,190
I...

326
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,190
am injured,

327
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,850
but I've been treated.

328
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,710
I'm fine.

329
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,360
The walls have ears.

330
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,630
You're so thoughtful.

331
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,310
I must destroy this mural.

332
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,770
Please move out of the hall

333
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,110
in case you get hurt.

334
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,170
Destroy the mural?

335
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,190
Why?

336
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,070
Qin Xiaobai is a drunkard.

337
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,780
Although he is unrestrained,

338
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,400
his painting skills are unparalleled.

339
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,900
Mara's Defeat is missing its finishing touch,

340
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,190
but it's already

341
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,430
reminiscent of a legendary masterpiece.

342
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,290
Since Qin Xiaobai drew the mural,

343
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,450
it's my first time here.

344
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,310
Look.

345
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,990
The painted demon

346
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,730
is so lifelike.

347
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,630
That's why

348
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,490
I must destroy this mural.

349
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,610
This is just a painting.

350
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,140
Do you really believe

351
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,010
Mara will break out of the mural?

352
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,750
I don't believe it.

353
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,110
Do you believe

354
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,690
someone used this mural

355
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,490
to kill people

356
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,910
and disrupt the capital?

357
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,780
Apart from Imperial College's professor Kong Mao,

358
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,310
Hot Springs Overseer He Chi,

359
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,790
Chief Musician Sun Wang,

360
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,170
and my subordinate Guo Zhuang

361
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,089
were also killed by him

362
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,750
and their livers were dug out.

363
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,849
Is there really a demon

364
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,630
using this painting to kill people?

365
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,829
Do you have evidence?

366
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,630
I...

367
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,950
I saw it in Ghost Market that day.

368
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,670
Mara looks just like the demon

369
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,470
in this mural.

370
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,589
What does that prove?

371
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,270
Lu Lingfeng.

372
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,550
As the deputy president of the Supreme Court,

373
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,550
I won't punish you

374
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,869
for failing to catch Mara.

375
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,230
Why pick trouble with this mural?

376
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,510
The demons in the dark

377
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,490
are misleading people.

378
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,550
Removing the mural

379
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,720
will quell the demons' ill intentions

380
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,860
to pacify the people.

381
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,270
Do you know

382
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,120
I ordered for this mural to pray for

383
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,870
Heavenly Empress' blessings?

384
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,150
I know.

385
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,370
Heavenly Empress is my birth mother.

386
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,670
Who is she to you?

387
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,400
On the first day of October, Mingyin Festival,

388
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,530
I wanted to bring you

389
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,070
to chant sutras with me

390
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,630
and consecrate the mural.

391
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,680
Do you know what I mean?

392
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,590
But you want to destroy it.

393
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,130
Lu Lingfeng.

394
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,360
Is someone

395
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,830
scared to death

396
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,580
by the meaning of this mural?

397
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,430
What you did today

398
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,070
must be the Crown Prince's order

399
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,670
to use it to their advantage.

400
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,880
It's unrelated with Crown Prince.

401
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,550
I just don't want the murderer

402
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,080
to use this painting again.

403
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,770
After I destroy the mural,

404
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,630
I'll turn myself in to you.

405
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,720
I have no regrets even if I die.

406
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,680
The Eastern Palace is so clever.

407
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,200
He's using you to deal with me.

408
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,610
Your Highness.

409
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,840
You misunderstood.

410
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,870
I don't want to hear you

411
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,330
explain for Crown Prince.

412
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,390
My heart aches.

413
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,320
Ji'er.

414
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,150
I've wronged you before.

415
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,490
Today,

416
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,720
even if you stab me here.

417
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,950
I won't blame you.

418
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,710
Lest the Eastern Palace plot

419
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,950
to initiate war

420
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,170
and destroy Chang'an

421
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,530
with blades and swords.

422
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,130
Do it.

423
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,130
Today is a rare opportunity.

424
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,070
Killing me would

425
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,610
earn you great merit with them.

426
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,430
Please stop.

427
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,230
You have my blood.

428
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,190
You can't do it.

429
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,460
In that case,

430
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,400
let Su Wuming

431
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,180
handle this case.

432
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,550
My son needs to recuperate.

433
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,000
Don't make me

434
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,800
worry about you.

435
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,780
Lu Lingfeng!

436
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,640
Ms. Xijun.

437
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,720
It's been a few months.

438
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,350
Why do you cry so much now?

439
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,050
He's badly injured

440
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,470
but doesn't want to be treated.

441
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,360
What's the use of pounding these medicines?

442
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,340
Just do as I say.

443
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,030
I'm sure it'll be of use later.

444
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,230
I'm sure.

445
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,510
Destroying the mural,

446
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,040
the demon will have nothing to rely on.

447
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,780
Then he will show his true form.

448
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,750
Mr. Lu's move

449
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,600
seems reckless,

450
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,420
but it's a good idea.

451
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,680
Unfortunately,

452
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,670
I failed.

453
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,290
No.

454
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,310
Doesn't the princess protecting the mural

455
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,310
further confirm

456
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,770
your previous deduction?

457
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,140
My deduction?

458
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,090
How do you know about that?

459
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,030
Although Kong Mao and He Chi

460
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,150
are not high-ranking officials,

461
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,110
they were all promoted by the Crown Prince recently.

462
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,850
They died one after another.

463
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,250
It was not a coincidence.

464
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,130
They should be sacrifices

465
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,530
in the court disputes.

466
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,350
This was indeed what I used to think.

467
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,850
But Sun Wang wasn't promoted by Crown Prince

468
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,540
but Princess.

469
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,910
Have you found out

470
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,470
that Sun Wang drank at Cloud Tower

471
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,690
before he died?

472
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,350
Of course.

473
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,610
Sun Wang even

474
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,810
had an argument with Qin Xiaobai.

475
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,590
Qin Xiaobai outrageously said

476
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,180
that Mara could break out of the mural.

477
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,550
So you followed

478
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,470
along this clue.

479
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,990
Isn't that right?

480
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,630
Yes.

481
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,790
But did you notice that

482
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,920
on that day,

483
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,150
among his colleagues from the Court of Imperial Sacrifices

484
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,130
that Sun Wang drank with,

485
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,490
there's a man

486
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,600
named Xu Zhiyun.

487
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,420
He was recently promoted by His Highness,

488
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,790
just like Kong Mao and He Chi.

489
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,790
Ridiculous!

490
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,950
Chief Musician.

491
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,090
[Xu Zhiyun, Minister of Rites, Court of Imperial Sacrifices]

492
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,830
You once paid a visit to Chengfo Temple

493
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,190
to see the murals too, didn't you?

494
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,590
We've got the Master here today.

495
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,990
Come and propose a toast.

496
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,390
So the one Mara wanted to kill

497
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,630
in the first place was Xu Zhiyun,

498
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,710
not Sun Wang.

499
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,200
This is just one of the possibilities.

500
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,670
Killing these three minor officials

501
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,730
has been enough to intimidate those

502
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,660
who want to lean on His Highness.

503
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,210
I'll go find Xu Zhiyun

504
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,560
and ask him not to go out.

505
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,910
I've already done that.

506
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,730
I also asked someone to stay there and protect him.

507
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,550
I feel so woozy.

508
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,550
Fed.

509
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,590
What kind of incense is this?

510
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,310
Of course it's good stuff.

511
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,420
This incense wasn't for you.

512
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,100
You should thank him.

513
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,840
Me?

514
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,070
I feel dizzy too.

515
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,360
This incense...

516
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,790
Master.

517
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,410
Are you going to sleep?

518
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,920
Do you think I can sleep?

519
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,830
Think about it. I, Xu Zhiyun,

520
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,120
am valued by the reigning Crown Prince

521
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,830
and got transferred to the Court of Imperial Sacrifices as the Minister of Rites.

522
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,470
I was riding high.

523
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,140
Given how great my life is,

524
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,590
I should be having drinks

525
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,120
and enjoying shindigs now.

526
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,610
But that Su Wuming, he...

527
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,870
Recently, there have been many killings

528
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,190
of officials in the capital.

529
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,830
Mr. Xu.

530
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,960
I heard about it.

531
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,330
I'm not afraid.

532
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,900
It's brave of you, Mr. Xu.

533
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,310
But if you trust my predictions,

534
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,270
I’m afraid

535
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,310
it's your turn next.

536
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,350
You...

537
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,330
What kind of nonsense was that?

538
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,110
I can't even get out of my house.

539
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,280
What an anticlimax.

540
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,630
This pot of treasure

541
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,950
has been boiled to the final stage.

542
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,390
Why haven't you brought me

543
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,270
what I want?

544
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,470
Please spare my life, My Lord.

545
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,320
It's just Xu Zhiyun

546
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,310
seemed to be on guard

547
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,350
and didn't dare to go out at all.

548
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,010
Are you looking for an excuse?

549
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,910
I dare not.

550
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,440
I'm incompetent, My Lord.

551
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,190
But it's actually

552
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,430
not that difficult to get a liver.

553
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,870
The prisoners in the Ministry of Justice Prison,

554
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,040
the beggars on the streets,

555
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,550
and the dying men in the Ghost Market...

556
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,190
Bastard!

557
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,600
Why don't you just go find a tomb robber

558
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,870
and buy a dead man's liver?

559
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,950
I dare not, My Lord.

560
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,490
The treasure I'm making

561
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,110
will still shine in a thousand years.

562
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,800
Or, it's safe to say that

563
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,960
only by using my treasure

564
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,670
can I leave

565
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,430
an indelible masterpiece for this world.

566
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,680
How can we

567
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,740
cut corners on the paint

568
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,470
and tolerate shoddy material?

569
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,730
I understand, My Lord.

570
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,080
You must get it within two days.

571
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,790
Otherwise,

572
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,420
you may want to worry about your life.

573
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:57,960
Yes.

574
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,590
The finishing touch

575
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,310
Mara's Defeat of Chengfo Temple is waiting for

576
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,070
is this treasure.

577
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,310
What took you so long, loser?

578
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,660
Pour me some wine.

579
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,950
Yes.

580
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,000
Yes, Senior.

581
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,520
Please enjoy, Senior.

582
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,030
Go away.

583
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,510
Leave me alone.

584
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,000
Se... Senior.

585
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,070
The moonlight is bright tonight.

586
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,950
Why don't you do the finishing touch

587
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,410
under this moonlight?

588
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,580
Three days ago,

589
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,670
when Her Highness came to Chengfo Temple,

590
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,870
she made a threat that

591
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,190
if you couldn't get the job done

592
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,850
before Mingyin Festival, she...

593
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,710
She'd kill me?

594
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,400
She didn't say it that way.

595
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,080
I, Qin Xiaobai,

596
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,790
have drawn all the murals,

597
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,710
loved all the women,

598
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,710
and had all the wine

599
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,790
that I wanted.

600
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,230
I have no regrets.

601
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,760
Anyone can

602
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,790
take my life anytime.

603
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,150
But... But the criticism of you

604
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,350
from the art world of Chang'an

605
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,590
will be passed down to future generations.

606
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,230
How many decent painters are there in Chang'an?

607
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,870
How are they qualified to talk about me?

608
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,090
To... Tonight,

609
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,480
Dan Zhu who paints murals at Guangde Temple

610
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,950
invited a few fellows

611
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,590
to have a drink at Dong's Restaurant.

612
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,070
They said at dinner that

613
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,790
you've not only lost your touch, Senior,

614
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,190
but...

615
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,430
But also exhausted your talent.

616
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,510
Senior, you can hit me if you want.

617
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,910
It wasn't me who said that.

618
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,950
I just heard it.

619
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,720
If I knew how to use a knife,

620
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,670
I would have rushed in

621
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,330
and killed those jerks

622
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,190
who were slandering you, Senior.

623
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,550
Let them

624
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,550
say whatever they want.

625
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,430
Senior.

626
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,820
You've been delaying the finishing touch.

627
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,480
You must have no inspiration.

628
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,080
I actually have an idea.

629
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,110
What, Senior?

630
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,840
You've also heard of Flying Light?

631
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,000
This thing appeared in Dongdu a few years ago.

632
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,790
I heard

633
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,670
the murals that use this as the finishing touch

634
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,230
are the most attractive to pilgrims.

635
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,350
Its eyes shine extraordinarily brightly,

636
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,080
and they even

637
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,720
move as

638
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,030
the viewers move.

639
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:25,790
Now,

640
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,830
just over a month ago,

641
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,670
the best Flying Light appeared in Chang'an.

642
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,270
Many people only have average painting skills,

643
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,400
but with this Flying Light,

644
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,380
they received lots of offers of mural painting

645
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,710
and made loads of money.

646
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,210
Although I haven't bought it yet,

647
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,880
I believe

648
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,680
nothing is impossible for a willing heart.

649
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
I will definitely

650
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,750
buy the Flying Light for you, Senior.

651
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,510
A few years ago,

652
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,830
in Dongdu?

653
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,590
You are so ignorant.

654
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,240
That demon has been around

655
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,710
for hundreds of years.

656
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,030
Hundreds of years?

657
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,510
Zu.

658
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,070
You lowly slave.

659
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,150
The reason why I redeemed you

660
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,470
is that I wanted you to stay by my side

661
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,590
and learn the Way of Danqing.

662
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,590
Not only do you rest on your laurels,

663
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,670
you also came up with such an idea.

664
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,590
Would I, Qin Xiaobai, go this low?

665
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,310
Get out!

666
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,910
Qin Xiaobai spent every day

667
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,510
thinking about the finishing touch for the mural.

668
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,810
I peeped from outside the window

669
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,190
and saw him crying a lot.

670
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,590
To be honest,

671
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,650
even I wish he could start soon

672
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,470
and stop torturing himself.

673
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,470
In that case,

674
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,650
there's nothing suspicious.

675
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:38,890
Indeed.

676
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,230
But

677
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,060
his junior, Zu,

678
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,710
has been wandering around.

679
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,870
He has been to

680
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,020
almost every painting shop in both West Market and East Market.

681
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,210
So a painter went to some painting shops.

682
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,340
What's the big deal?

683
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,510
If he was just buying some ordinary paints,

684
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,150
it wouldn't have been a big deal.

685
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:52,990
But he went to

686
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,190
Shenzhu Painting Shop in East Market alone

687
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,310
three times a day,

688
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,350
and got kicked out in the end.

[Shenzhu Painting Shop]

690
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,140
It seems that he broke

691
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,950
their rules.

692
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,190

Shenzhu Painting Shop?

696
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,800
What a coincidence.

697
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,890
Bi Chengye also went there every day.

698
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,270

699
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,220

700
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,210
That's right.

701
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,960
I asked around.

702
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,630
Shenzhu Painting Shop's owner

703
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,430
is Bi Chengye.

is actually just a accountant.

That's quite

707
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,780
interesting.

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,300
bring this to me?

767
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,380
What an eyesore!

768
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,800
Don't do that.

769
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,350
It wasn't easy to get.

770
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,489
If you don't want to see it,

771
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,780
I... I'll put it away.

772
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,510
But Mr. Qin.

773
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,190
Why do you hate

774
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,050
this Flying Light so much?

775
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,450
Rumor has it that

776
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,220
after the Mara escaped the wall and did evil,

777
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,990
this mysterious paint suddenly appeared.

778
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,870
I suspect there are connections between the two events.

779
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,830
Please tell me everything you know, Mr. Qin.

780
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,950
The Flying Light

781
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,150
is the Mara.

782
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,370
This thing came into being

783
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,430
before late Wei.

784
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,510
It was originally named Flying Light

785
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,830
because it was no ordinary paint.

786
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,140
Its main ingredients are

787
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,700
Azurite and Silverfish.

788
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,670
In addition,

789
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,670
there are many other mixed ingredients in it.

790
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,730
There are different rumors about it.

791
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,750
But this evil being

792
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,270
has long been judged

793
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,250
as a taboo item.

794
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,150
You are a government official.

795
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,410
How could you not know?

796
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,430
I... I really didn’t know that.

797
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,100
It is said that

798
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,580
the painting finished by Flying Light

799
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,860
can be incredibly lifelike.

800
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,750
Now,

801
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,600
various temples are competing in murals.

802
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,060
Many painters

803
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,650
spend a lot of money

804
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,790
on this taboo item

805
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,310
to boost their status.

806
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,050
Shameless.

807
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,790
Do you know

808
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,870
why I, Qin Xiaobai,

809
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,310
still haven't done the finishing touch?

810
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,940
It's because I want to do my finishing touch

811
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,430
better than Flying Light with ordinary paints.

812
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,200
Only in this way

813
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,030
can I live up to

814
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,090
the title of the Best Painter of Tang.

815
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,660
Thank you, Mr. Qin, for enlightening us.

816
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,300
After hearing what you said,

817
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,640
I sincerely admire you.

818
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,420
I believe

819
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,860
you can successfully add the finishing touch

820
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,540
and complete this great work.

821
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,140
At that time,

822
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,550
if you don't mind,

823
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,110
I, Pei Xijun,

824
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,150
would like

825
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,870
to be your apprentice.

826
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,590
Should we confiscate

827
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,070
Shenzhu Painting Shop right away?

828
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,420
Don't alert them.

829
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,510
We should start by investigating the raw materials.

830
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,550
Although Azurite is rare,

831
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:14,340
[Great Buddha Hall]

832
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,470
Chang'an is such a big city.

833
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,330
I believe we can buy it somewhere.

834
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,960
What is this Silverfish?

835
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,670
A Silverfish is a bookworm.

836
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:17,890
It's the silver white shiny thing

837
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,730
in the powder.

838
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,190
I, Su Wuming,

839
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,550
have been studying for most of my life, but I didn't think of that.

840
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,550
Bookworms?

841
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,640
They're so hard to find.

842
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,630
It takes a lot of bookworms to make Flying Light.

843
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,030
Where can we get them?

844
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,060
Bookstores.

845
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,830
There are only limited number of books

846
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,160
in bookstores.

847
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,550
Besides, most of them are new books.

Brother.

849
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,500
The Palace Library.

850
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,930
Right.

851
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,700
There are more than tens of thousands of books there.

852
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,960
Besides, they're mainly ancient books.

853
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,750
They must have the most bookworms.

854
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,770
[Palace Library]

855
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,360
Su Wuming.

856
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,390
Do you know the skill of divination?

857
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,640
I'm not that capable, Directorate.

858
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,870
Then how do you know that someone in the Palace Library

859
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,070
has been secretly catching bookworms?

860
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,910
Liang Zhi.

861
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,550
What are you doing?

862
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,130
[Liang Zhi from Palace Library]

863
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,420
I was looking for the works of Wei

864
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,960
when I found that

865
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,480
the books are too old.

866
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,270
They're full of bookworms.

867
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,770
I was worried that the books might be damaged,

868
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,030
so I came to catch them.

869
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,960
All the books here are ancient books,

870
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,450
so there are many bookworms in them. What's the big deal?

871
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,750
Do you think you can catch them all?

872
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,150
Go back to proofreading.

873
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:49,750
Yes.

874
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,740
After that,

875
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,830
I saw him catching bookworms

876
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,730
more than once.

877
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,390
What?

878
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,690
Is it related to your case?

879
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,750
Directorate.

880
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,270
Can you take me to see him?

881
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,290
Where is Liang Zhi?

882
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,510
Directorate.

883
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,830
He isn't here yet.

884
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,570
It's already this hour.

885
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,900
Why is he still not here?

886
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,470
Where does he live?

887
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,510
He doesn't have a house in Chang'an.

888
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,260
He usually stays

889
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,840
at the Xuandu Temple.

890
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,160
But

891
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,440
he's been going to

892
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,030
Cloud Tower in Pingkang Fang a lot lately.

893
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,430

894
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,500
Come on, have a drink.

895
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,070
Come on, have another one.

There's such a beautiful courtesan here,

905
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,390
but didn't tell me.

[The Supreme Court]

907
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,230
I only caught

908
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,390
some bookworms.

00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,440
How many people in the Palace Library

912
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,660
are there who catch bookworms

913
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,460
like you do?

Including the Collators and Proofreaders,

915
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,510
there are more than 10.

916
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,870
So who initiated it?

917
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,870
I did.

918
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,230
I'd also collect

919
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,350
all the bookworms they caught.

920
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,910

00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,830
Commander Hu

956
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,940
really paid me a lot of money.

957
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,120
So you instigated your colleagues

958
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,060
to catch bookworms with you?

959
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,540
You collect them at a low price,

960
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,990
and then sell at a high price?

961
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,230
I... I just wanted to make more money.

962
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,230
Where do you

963
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,140
trade every time?

964
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,750
At Cloud Tower.

965
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,540
Look. I have it with me.

966
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,590
That's why

967
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,910
I didn't go to the Palace Library today.

968
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,510
But instead of Commander Hu,

969
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,850
that woman was the one who showed up.

970
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,390
Oh no.
