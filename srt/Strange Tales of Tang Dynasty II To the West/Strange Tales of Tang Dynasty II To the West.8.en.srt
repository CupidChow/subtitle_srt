[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty II To the West]

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,009
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,270
Cao has been mentally ill for years.

5
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,509
The postmortem she performed

6
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,509
shouldn't count.

7
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,570
But I think that female coroner

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,650
is highly skilled and experienced.

9
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,470
You...

10
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,560
The exact time of death

11
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,650
should be between a quarter past 12 and 3 quarters past 12 in the midnight.

12
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,750
How can you tell?

13
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,680
The shape of the wound

14
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,490
and the color of blood after coagulation

15
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,590
can both be the bases for inference.

16
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,790
The old lady said that

17
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,010
my brother Dugu Yang

18
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,610
was stabbed in an instant,

19
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,940
and he was defenseless.

20
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,740
When people are about to get stabbed,

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,750
they'll subconsciously

22
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,620
cover their body by their hands.

23
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,150
So

24
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,290
their hands usually get injured.

25
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,350
But either of Dugu Yang's hands

26
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,190
was injured.

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,630
Here.

28
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,550
Look at the wound.

29
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,750
It's irregular in shape, and blood splattered radially.

30
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,829
This means he was stabbed while he was still alive.

31
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,590
If he was stabbed after death,

32
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,390
then

33
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,420
the would on the skin should be neatly shaped.

34
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,750
I see.

35
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,270
After a person dies,

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,390
the blood circulation will be blocked.

37
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,560
There're curls and bulges on the skin.

38
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,580
It's caused by the murderer stabbing the flesh

39
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,710
and then stirring it vigorously.

40
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,780
This actually rules out

41
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,740
the possibility that the clay figurines killed him.

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,660
Who is this person?

43
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,850
Please tell us, Magistrate Dugu.

44
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,120
Who's he?

45
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,710
A liar.

46
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,090
He only learned something from the books

47
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,150
and managed to fool

48
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,350
the nerd magistrate.

49
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,290
Ignore him.

50
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,230
How dare you!

51
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,430
You can say whatever you want about me,

52
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,150
but you shouldn't

53
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,390
have called Magistrate a nerd.

54
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,790
Do you want to be flogged?

55
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,710
I...

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,040
I'll get flogged just because I called him a nerd?

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,079
How condescending!

58
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,060
Any objection?

59
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,020
Yes.

60
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,360
Investigating cases and apprehending criminals

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,750
are supposed to the sheriff's responsibility.

62
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,000
But the position of sheriff has been vacant for many years in Shiyang County.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,590
Whenever a murder case happened,

64
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,150
I was the one to solve it.

65
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,470
But

66
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,810
he came here today.

67
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,070
He knows nothing

68
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,950
and keeps getting in our way.

69
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,800
I, Su Daming, told him off.

70
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,860
So what?

71
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,520
Isn't your name Niu Daming?

72
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,700
When did you change your last name to Su?

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,630
What do you know?

74
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,830
Whenever I investigate a case,

75
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,310
I take my mother's last name.

76
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,950
What?

77
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,250
Is there a problem?

78
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,779
Among all those who're dead,

79
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,590
I admire Detective Di the most.

80
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,950
Among all those who're alive,

81
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,470
I believe Su Wuming is the greatest detective.

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,070
After he solved the Sky-scraping Tower case,

83
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,290
I specially went

84
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,190
to learn detective skills from him.

85
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,470
He, Su Wuming,

86
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,140
and I, Su Daming,

87
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,110
will solve the unsolved cases together

88
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,170
and become famous overnight in Tang.

89
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,110
You're talking nonsense.

90
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,080
Are you questioning me?

91
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,830
Since you learned detective skills

92
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,630
from Su Wuming,

93
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,280
you must have seen him in person.

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,950
Of course.

95
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,470
We spent every day together

96
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,850
for 3 months.

97
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,630
The Sky-scraping Tower case

98
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,370
happened on the Mid-Autumn Festival this year.

99
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,230
It's only been less than 3 months.

100
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,430
Besides,

101
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,470
I've never taught anyone

102
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,670
named Su Daming or Niu Daming.

103
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,780
But I did see

104
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,170
Braggart Daming today.

105
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,190
You...

106
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,470
Let go!

107
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,170
Let go!

108
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,130
Su Wuming is right in front of you.

109
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,660
How dare you be so reckless!

110
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,470
Magistrate Dugu.

111
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,790
Is this really Detective Di's disciple,

112
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,740
Su Wuming?

113
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,670
Of course.

114
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,150
Mr. Su and I

115
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,010
are old friends from Nanzhou.

116
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,030
I heard that

117
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,880
you're a high-ranking official in the imperial court.

118
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,810
Are you here for a private visit?

119
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,390
Does why I came to Shiyang

120
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,340
have anything to do with this case?

121
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,020
Officer Niu.

122
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,870
Didn't you say

123
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,790
you're the one who solved all the cases and apprehended the criminals?

124
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,909
So what should we do next?

125
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,290
Well...

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,170
Move the body to the government office first.

127
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,750
Guards!

128
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,260
Drag away the killing clay figurines.

129
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,660
Take it.

130
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,870
Watch out!

131
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,990
Hurry up.

132
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,560
Find a doctor to treat him.

133
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

134
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:17,950
Come on.

135
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,910
Niu Daming.

136
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,290
This is a burial goods store.

137
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,110
The clay figurines are for keeping tomb robbers away.

138
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,520
You are so careless.

139
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,600
How did you solve the previous cases?

140
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,950
I...

141
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,070
Aren't clay figurines

142
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,750
for keeping tomb robbers away?

143
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,370
Why did they

144
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,870
stab Coroner Dugu

145
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,590
to death?

146
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:43,830
Exactly.

147
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,820
Those things he tinkered with

148
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,280
have always looked scary.

149
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,350
It might actually be

150
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,080
the clay figurines that did it.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,990
Mr. Ma, you're here too.

152
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,240
The naans stuffed with lamb in your restaurant

153
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,970
are amazing.

154
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,430
Why're you talking to him?

155
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,030
No matter how delicious his naans are,

156
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,910
you can't buy them.

157
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,430
Why?

158
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,510
He's Ma Laoshi's son.

159
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,950
The one who was beheaded?

160
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,670
Yes.

161
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,910
His parents were both tomb robbers.

162
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,220
[Lingdu Burial Goods Store]

163
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,750
Magistrate Dugu.

164
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,480
Sometimes, solving cases

165
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,270
with traditional methods actually works.

166
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,670
For example, bounties.

167
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,310
Take this case as an example.

168
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,360
You can offer a bounty of 300 or 500 taels.

169
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,850
Maybe someone

170
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,510
will provide clues for us.

171
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,970
I'll do as you say, Sir.

172
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,170
I'll put an announcement up right away.

173
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,820
Coroner Dugu!

174
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,310
How could you die just like that?

175
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,030
After my father passed away,

176
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,750
I bought clay figurines from you.

177
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,230
They really kept the tomb robbers away.

178
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,100
Our family is indebted to you.

179
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,020
Coroner Dugu!

180
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,550
My savior!

181
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,500
My savior!

182
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,950
My savior!

183
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,530
My savior!

184
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,590
Get up.

185
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,720
It's rare to see someone so grateful.

186
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,140
What's your last name?

187
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,020
Lu.

188
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,980
My condolences.

189
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,910
Make way.

190

Let's go.

191
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,060
It's so bold of you

192
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,750
to come into town in broad daylight.

193
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,070
Boss Dong.

194
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,240
It's you.

195
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,910
You scared the hell out of me.

196
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,790
What good stuff have you dug up

197
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,710
recently?

198
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,870
Why haven't you sent them to Treasure Pavilion?

199
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,030
Don't even get me started.

200
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,760
We didn't dig up any good stuff,

201
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,560
but we lost three of our men.

202
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,280
They weren't killed by

203
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,980
the coroner's clay figurines, were they?

204
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,110
They actually were.

205
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,230
My younger brother came here to get even with Dugu Yang,

206
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,360
and he disappeared.

207
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,230
I'm here to look for him.

208
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,990
Could it be Lu Er

209
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,210
who killed Dugu Yang?

210
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,290
This...

211
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,710
No...

212
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,140
No way.

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,960
Assistant Xu.

214
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,710
How many households surnamed Lu are there in Shiyang?

215
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,990
Lu?

216
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,800
There's none, I think.

217
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,310
Go

218
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,290
bring him back.

219
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

220
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,310
Shiyang is an ancient county.

221
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,860
On Shiyang Mountain,

222
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,140
there're many ancient tombs from the six dynasties of Han and Wei,

223
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
causing rampant tomb robbery.

224
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,850
You implemented a new policy as soon as you took office

225
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,710
to punish tomb robbers severely.

226
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,480
It won the people's hearts.

227
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,080
I heard the name of Magistrate Dugu

228
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,830
from even a hundred miles away.

229
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,290
I knew it was you.

230
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,000
So I took a detour to Shiyang

231
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,310
to see you.

232
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:48,930
Mr. Su.

233
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,230
Are we actually meeting in real life,

234
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,460
not in a dream?

235
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,550
Of course not.

236
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,070
Since Physician Fei started treating me,

237
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,730
I stopped having nightmares.

238
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,390
But today,

239
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,870
I saw Qinghong.

240
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,550
Who?

241
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,900
Look.

242
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,830
Look.

243
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,530
This...

244
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,930
This is Qinghong's portrait

245
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,750
I asked Miss Xijun to draw for me.

246
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,550
I saw her again today.

247
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,670
In this vast world,

248
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,400
there must be people

249
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,550
who look alike.

250
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,280
Qinghong is dead.

251
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,150
I did the postmortem.

252
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,910
You've identified the body too.

253
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,030
No.

254
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:35,970
Do you think

255
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,880
there's a possibility that

256
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,640
the one who died that day

257
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,070
wasn't Qinghong?

258
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,850
The real Qinghong ran away out of anger

259
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,980
and came to Shiyang?

260
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,570
This sounds like

261
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,240
a script for an opera.

262
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,660
Mr. Su, trust me.

263
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,150
If this woman wasn't Qinghong,

264
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,110
why would she have married

265
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,370
Dugu Yang, who had the same surname as me?

266
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,070
You mean

267
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,870
Dugu Yang's wife

268
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,830
looks like Qinghong?

269
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,750
That's right.

270
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,870
Since I saw her this morning,

271
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,150
it's like my soul has been

272
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,380
taken away from my body.

273
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,500
When I was at the burial goods store,

274
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,990
I was barely hanging in.

275
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,120
Thank goodness you're here.

276
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,600
Magistrate Dugu.

277
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,930
We've brought him back.

278
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,020
Put your personal business aside.

279
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,240
Go interrogate the tomb robber first.

280
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,350
Who are you?

281
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,630
Tell me your name.

282
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,200
Last name Lu, first name Da.

283
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,550
Lu Da, right?

284
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,050
Tell me

285
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,350
everything about your tomb robbery.

286
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,360
Are you judging me as a tomb robber

287
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
just for these things?

288
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,390
The calluses on your hands

289
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,890
aren't something ordinary people have.

290
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,250
The purple mud under your fingernails

291
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,320
is unique

292
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,540
in Shiyang Mountain, which has many ancient tombs.

293
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,390
I'm sure

294
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,210
it's recorded in Shiyang County Chronicle.

295
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,510
So what?

296
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,020
It's nothing.

297
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,550
But the excuse you used

298
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,410
to mourn Coroner Dugu

299
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,170
was too fake.

300
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,660
Coroner Dugu.

301
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,230
How could you die just like that?

302
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,090
After my father passed away,

303
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,860
I bought clay figurines from you.

304
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,430
They really kept tomb robbers away.

305
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,710
There's no household in Shiyang surnamed Lu.

306
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,160
People from other counties

307
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,040
won't come to Shiyang to buy burial goods.

308
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,590
So how did you know that

309
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,230
the clay figurines kept the tomb robbers away?

310
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,050
Did you dig up

311
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,010
your own family's ancestral grave

312
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,150
and checked?

313
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,440
I...

314
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,070
You pretended to mourn Coroner Dugu.

315
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,740
But actually,

316
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,750
you were looking for someone, weren't you?

317
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,190
You...

318
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,190
You...

319
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,110
What?

320
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,960
If you don't tell the truth,

321
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,950
you'll be severely punished.

322
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,870
I confess.

323
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,350
I'll confess everything.

324
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,380
My men and I

325
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,870
have always been making a living by robbing tombs.

326
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,010
It's been half a month

327
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,520
since we came to Shiyang this time.

328
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,720
We investigated multiple times

329
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,650
before we finally found a big tomb.

330
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,420
However,

331
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,580
my brother and I

332
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,340
almost got scared to death.

333
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,100
We fled Shiyang City and ran dozens of miles.

334
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,710
But deep down,

335
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,740
I'm not convinced.

336
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,570
It's the first time

337
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,790
something like this ever happened since I started robbing tombs.

338
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,990
After asking around,

339
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,850
I got to know that the clay figurines were made by Dugu Yang.

340
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,680
My younger brother said

341
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,800
he wanted to teach him a lesson.

342
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,150
But he never came back after he left.

343
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,590
I came into town this time

344
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,030
to look for Lu Er.

345
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,950
Impressive.

346
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,780
I've long heard that

347
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,510
Su Wuming is the greatest detective of our time.

348
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,110
I finally got to see it today.

349
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,670
Lu Da, let me ask you.

350
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,140
When did Lu Er come into town?

351
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,370
Yesterday afternoon.

352
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,340
Yesterday afternoon?

353
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,070
Magistrate Dugu.

354
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,310
I have no more questions.

355
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,820
Let him sign the confession

356
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,880
and put him in jail.

357
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,750
Take him down!

358
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,430
-Yes!
-Yes!

359
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,590
Go!

360
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,310
Go!

361
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,590
Mr. Su.

362
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,350
What's next?

363
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,150
How is

364
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,470
Dugu Yang's aged mother doing?

365
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,270
She's awake.

366
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,110
A doctor prescribed some medicine for her.

367
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,750
She's taken it.

368
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,630
She should be fine.

369
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,070
Who else is in his family?

370
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,190
He has a wife named Chuntiao.

371
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,420
Take her here for interrogation.

372
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,350
You can interrogate her now.

373
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,750
Who are you?

374
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,750
We met this morning.

375
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,240
And you said

376
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,730
a lot of embarrassing things to me.

377
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,590
Now you pretend you don't know me?

378
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,330
This...

379
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,560
Don't take this down.

380
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,380
Stop talking nonsense.

381
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,470
Answer the question Magistrate Dugu asked.

382
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,270
Yes.

383
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,690
My name is Chuntiao.

384
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,140
I'm Dugu Yang's wife.

385
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,590
I'm a widow now.

386
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,960
Anything else you want to ask?

387
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,430
Chuntiao.

388
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,750
Your real name is Qinghong,

389
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,280
and you came from Nanzhou.

390
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,990
My coroner husband told me

391
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,079
the new magistrate

392
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,270
is a great man in every way.

393
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,200
I didn't expect you to be a lunatic.

394
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,790
Are you really not Qinghong?

395
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,510
Chuntiao.

396
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,730
Where were you born?

397
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,680
Shiyang.

398
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,589
When did you marry Dugu Yang?

399
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,850
Seven years ago.

400
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,370
You all know Dugu Yang.

401
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,110
Is what Chuntiao said true?

402
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,680
Magistrate.

403
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,630
You can continue.

404
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,490
So there really are people

405
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,360
who look so alike in this vast world.

406
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,990
What are you talking about?

407
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,330
Say it louder.

408
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,950
Chuntiao!

409
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,410
Listen carefully.

410
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,060
Now I'm going to interrogate you.

411
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,950
Think before you answer,

412
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,550
because everything you say

413
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,680
will be documented.

414
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,920
First question.

415
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,200
Your husband died a violent death.

416
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,540
You knew it all along.

417
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,790
Why didn't you go to the burial goods store?

418
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,030
Why should I?

419
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,120
I hate seeing dead people.

420
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,070
But he was your husband.

421
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,150
So what?

422
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,470
I asked Mother to go, didn't I?

423
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,600
Your husband is dead,

424
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,690
yet you are so calm.

425
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,940
It doesn't make sense.

426
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,030
What sense?

427
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,230
Given what he did,

428
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,470
someone will kill him sooner or later.

429
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,910
That makes sense.

430
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,990
Why should I be surprised?

431
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,420
What he did?

432
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,210
You mean...

433
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,370
He got in the way of tomb robbers.

434
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,390
How could they possibly spare him?

435
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,750
Shiyang has nothing

436
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,530
but tomb robbers.

437
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,580
How can you be so sure

438
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,190
that Dugu Yang was killed by a tomb robber?

439
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,000
If not a tomb robber,

440
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,150
could it be you?

441
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,670
By the way,

442
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,250
didn't you two

443
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,130
have a drink together last night?

444
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:08,710
No...

445
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,940
Don't talk nonsense.

446
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,320
Continue.

447
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,660
Let me ask you.

448
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,720
Dugu Yang didn't come home last night.

449
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,170
Did you go out to look for him?

450
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:21,990
No.

451
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,260
It's common for him

452
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,750
to sleep at the burial goods store.

453
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,030
Once he started tinkering with the clay figurines,

454
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,670
it would go on for a whole night.

455
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,560
So,

456
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,910
you know

457
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,540
what being a grass widow is like, right?

458
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,910
Let me ask you.

459
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,830
Did Dugu Yang hold a grudge against anyone?

460
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,470
What a coincidence.

461
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,670
That's me.

462
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,870
In the past few years,

463
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,410
I've always given him the long face.

464
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,190
Why?

465
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,310
I despise him as a coroner.

466
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,170
We had no money,

467
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,900
and we were always looked down upon.

468
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I didn't even dare to have children.

469
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,310
Even if we had children, they wouldn't be able to take the imperial test.

470
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,370
He'd only be looked down upon like us.

471
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,300
Since you despise

472
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,290
his identity as a coroner,

473
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,490
why did you marry him in the first place?

474
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,270
It was because of his mother.

475
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,270
Back when my father was murdered,

476
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,940
it was his mother who did the postmortem

477
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,100
and found a nail stabbed on his head.

478
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,830
That's how we found the murderer.

479
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,330
I married him to repay her kindness.

480
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,310
I didn't expect him to become a coroner too.

481
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:17,790
But...

482
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,330
Coroners are coroners from generation to generation.

483
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,230
You didn't know that before you married him?

484
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,250
He had the option to quit.

485
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,850
He insisted on carrying on his mother's cause.

486
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,590
He did

487
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,300
whatever his mother told him to do,

488
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,150
but he'd quibble over every detail with me.

489
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,650
I just went out for tea,

490
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,350
and he kept grumbling.

491
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,190
Fine.

492
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,670
I could stay home.

493
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,870
But at least he should make it fun.

494
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,390
He spent all day with the clay figurines.

495
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,590
I feel like he'd rather sleep with them.

496
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,430
I was so unlucky

497
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,970
to have married him.

498
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,190
It was like living in a grave.

499
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,650
You can't say that.

500
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,430
Although Coroner's family is heavy with Yin energy,

501
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,680
he did make contributions

502
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,140
to the government office.

503
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,950
That's right.

504
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,870
What if

505
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,870
something happens to you one day, Chuntiao?

506
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,590
You'll need coroners too, won't you?

507
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,310
Nonsense!

508
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,510
Niu.

509
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,180
You're deliberately disgusting me.

510
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,600
Magistrate Dugu.

511
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,070
Discipline Niu Daming.

512
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,660
He's bullying me.

513
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,600
Officer Niu, don't interrupt.

514
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,720
Magistrate, you're the best.

515
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,410
Mr. Su.

516
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,000
I really don't know

517
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,110
what else to ask.

518
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,630
Assistant Xu.

519
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,140
Do you have any questions?

520
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,030
Did Dugu Yang owe any gambling debts?

521
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,630
He never gambled.

522
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,970
Why do you ask?

523
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,170
I was just asking.

524
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,070
Chuntiao.

525
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,870
What's your plan

526
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,390
for the future?

527
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,270
Do you want to

528
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,900
take care of me?

529
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,160
Look.

530
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,470
I said I was just asking.

531
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,750
Let her go back first.

532
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,590
Chuntiao.

533
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,260
You can go back first.

534
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,880
If anything comes up,

535
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,680
you may be summoned at any time.

536
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,910
See how good

537
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,590
Magistrate is at interrogation.

538
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,910
It's just there are so many people here today.

539
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,870
How about

540
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,120
you interrogate me in private next time?

541
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,670
Watch your mouth.

542
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,830
Fine.

543
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,670
I'll be serious then.

544
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,410
When can I claim

545
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,500
my husband's body?

546
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,270
We'll let you know

547
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,350
when you can claim it.

548
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,000
Now, just...

549
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,830
Where did Fei go?

550
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,250
The noodles are soggy.

551
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,070
I heard there's a Treasure Competition.

552
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,840
Chicken Fed

553
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,660
must have gone to join in the fun.

554
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,910
Why don't we eat first?

555
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,060
We can order another bowl for him when he comes back.

556
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,590
He's not young anymore,

557
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,150
but he still acts like a child.

558
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,550
It'll delay our journey.

559
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,310
[Gold Cups, Jade Plates]

560
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,790
Mr. Zhao's treasure is

561
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,490
a gold and silver-inlay bronze mirror

562
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,960
with the pattern of 4 mythical birds holding ribbons in their beaks.

563
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,510
Please take a look, everyone.

564
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,240
The mirror has a clear surface.

565
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,310
On the back, the outer edge is a circle of truelove knots made of gold yarn.

566
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,180
Inside the circle is

567
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,500
4 mythical birds inlayed by gold foil

568
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,030
with ribbon in their beaks,

569
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,820
flying with their wings wide open.

570
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,610
It's such a delicate mirror.

571
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,990
What a wonderful treasure.

572
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,560
It's just the skill of inlay. What's the big deal?

573
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,120
It's nothing just luxury.

574
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,510
Fold.

575
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,030
Call.

576
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,030
Check out mine.

577
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,910
A gold bowl with the pattern of Mandarin ducks sitting on lotus petals.

578
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,630
Mr. Qian.

579
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,470
Your stuff

580
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,300
is not even as good as his.

581
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,030
Although the pattern on this bowl is complicated,

582
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,710
it's still just a gold bowl.

583
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,230
It's been quite a long time.

584
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,950
Why are you still so vulgar?

585
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,070
If my gold bowl

586
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,050
can't beat that mirror,

587
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,040
then I've been part of the treasure competition

588
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,440
for decades for nothing.

589
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,280
Do I hear a call

590
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,570
from anyone here?

591
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,220
Anyone here has a share.

592
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,670
I'll raise 100 taels.

593
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,720
200 for me.

594
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,980
I'll raise 500.

595
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,830
I like this gold bowl.

596
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:55,930
I'll raise big.

597
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,390
Me too.

598
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,530
Old drunkard.

599
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
Do you have money?

600
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,470
If you want to join,

601
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,870
you have to show us money.

602
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,120
That's right. Take out your money.

603
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,190
I have this.

604
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,930
What treasure is this?

605
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,700
You may not be ready for this.

606
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,640
This is the weapon that God of War, Wang Jian, used

607
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,520
when he destroyed the six states.

608
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,980
It's called

609
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,750
Three-section Gold-plated Silver Spear.

610
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,470
What gold?

611
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,870
What silver?

612
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,990
It's indeed a nice spear,

613
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,070
but it's not that old.

614
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,710
I've never heard of

615
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,910
three-section spears before.

616
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,300
That's because you're out of touch.

617
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,190
Forget it.

618
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,540
I won't gamble with you vulgar people.

619
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,310
Stop!

620
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,490
Treasure competition is no child's play.

621
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,290
Those who regret will have their arms chopped off.

622
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,160
Chicken Fed, you're back.

623
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,070
Excuse me.

624
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,180
Noodles, please.

625
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,270
No need.

626
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,670
I have no appetite.

627
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,430
Let's hurry up and get on our way.

628
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,270
Qingchuan Town is not fun at all.

629
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,350
Fortunately, Xijun is thoughtful.

630
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,110
She's wrapped two catties of beef for you.

631
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,980
Otherwise, if you get hungry,

632
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,790
you'll steal chickens from other people's yards again.

633
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,510
Again?

634
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,190
What do you mean again?

635
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,650
I saved your life.

636
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,730
You owe me

637
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,890
a chicken every day to begin with.

638
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,260
Later on,

639
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,690
I did you many more favors.

640
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,760
The quota should have been raised to

641
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,780
two chickens per day.

642
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,140
If you had given me enough chicken

643
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,680
every day as agreed,

644
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,050
I wouldn't have...

645
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,710
Where is my spear?

646
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,410
Your spear?

647
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,700
Who saw it?

648
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,480
Chicken Fed.

649
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,660
I remember

650
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,870
you were carrying it with you.

651
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,260
Did you leave it somewhere?

652
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,240
No.

653
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,360
It's so heavy.

654
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,990
Why whould I carry it with me?

655
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,690
That's not right.

656
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,180
I remember you had it with you

657
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,100
when you were watching the competition.

658
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,360
Where did you leave it?

659
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,780
Qingchuan Town is so not fun.

660
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,790
There are so many swindlers.

661
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,040
What did you say?

662
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,950
3 versus 2.

663
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,990
The gold and silver-inlay bronze mirror

664
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,770
with the pattern of 4 mythical birds holding ribbons in their beaks wins.

665
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,630
How is that possible?

666
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,490
Are you

667
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,430
blind?

668
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,780
You collude with each other to cheat me on my money?

669
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,710
These are all well-known

670
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,750
antique experts.

671
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,350
Just admit defeat.

672
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,390
I...

673
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,400
Bro.

674
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,490
Go away.

675
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,110
That's how

676
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,630
your spear...

677
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,270
Say it again!

678
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,510
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

679
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,510
That's because

680
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,030
the wine I had this morning was horrible.

681
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,640
If you

682
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,230
had given me good wine every day,

683
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,950
I wouldn't have been confused.

684
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,680
Lead the way.

685
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,870
A grape, floral and bird-patterned silver sachet.

686
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,070
This is quite an item.

687
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,640
An item?

688
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,800
Guo.

689
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:43,790
I know you're

690
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,270
from Shiyang Treasure Pavilion.

691
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,780
But even if your boss,

692
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,110
Dong Haogu, was here,

693
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,200
he wouldn't be so arrogant.

694
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,070
That's right.

695
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,070
Mr. Sun.

696
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,100
How about we compete with him?

697
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,360
You bet on the silver sachet,

698
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,430
and I'll bet on

699
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,550
the mirror and the gold bowl.

700
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,430
Let's compete with him.

701
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,070
Okay.

702
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,590
Guo.

703
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,750
Show us what you've got.

704
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:10,970
Mr. Guo.

705
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,430
Look.

706
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,000
Is this

707
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,980
Dugu Xin Jet Tumbled Stone Multifaceted Seal?

708
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,540
Can this beat

709
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,400
your sachet, mirror,

710
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,530
and gold bowl or not?

711
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,470
Where did you get this multifaceted seal?

712
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,150
Don't.

713
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,710
According to the rules of the circle,

714
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,110
we don't ask where the treasures come from.

715
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,070
Don't bother.

716
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,230
We

717
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,190
admit defeat.

718
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,350
Wait.

719
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,800
This Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal

720
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,200
isn't real, right?

721
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,190
Where did you come from, little brat?

722
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,830
How can you say something like that without proof?

723
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,030
I came from Chang'an.

724
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,190
I just expressed

725
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,070
my suspicion.

726
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,820
You're a butler,

727
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,260
but you're so arrogant.

728
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,330
Could it be

729
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,030
this is a trap you set up

730
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,080
with Mr. Guo?

731
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,740
You...

732
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,480
Can I have a look?

733
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,790
Dugu Xin had 7 sons and 7 daughters.

734
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,830
He loved his children very much,

735
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,990
especially

736
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,470
his fourth daughter,

737
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,780
who's the birth mother

738
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,110
of Emperor Gaozu of Tang,

739
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,170
Empress Yuanzhen.

740
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,130
It is said that Empress Yuanzhen was naughty when she was little,

741
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,030
and she accidentally broke

742
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,150
her father's Jet Tumbled Stone Multifaceted Seal.

743
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,010
Therefore, one of the facets of the seal is damaged.

744
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,290
But all 26 facets

745
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,630
of this seal

746
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,640
are intact.

747
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,150
As expected from the people of Chang'an.

748
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,880
You are indeed knowledgeable.

749
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,290
Mr. Sun.

750
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,750
Is it because you can't afford to lose?

751
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,590
I...

752
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,240
Little brat.

753
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,310
As you said,

754
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,680
it's just a legend.

755
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,830
How can you really believe it?

756
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,230
If it isn't intact,

757
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,150
how can it be called

758
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,190
the ultimate treasure in the world?

759
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,630
"I hereby inform."

760
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,940
"I hereby report."

761
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,110
"Highest Military Officer's Seal."

762
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,840
"Military Commander's Seal."

763
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,150
Military Commander?

764
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,310
That's not right.

765
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,150
In the twelfth year of the reign of Western Wei,

766
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,580
the prefectural governor of Liangzhou, Yuwen Zhonghe rebelled.

767
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,470
Dugu Xin was ordered to conquer him

768
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,680
and attacked Liangzhou at night.

769
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,130
He captured Yuwen Zhonghe alive

770
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,390
and won a complete victory.

771
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,250
He was conferred the title of Commander-in-Chief.

772
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,550
Commander and Commander-in-Chief

773
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,240
are not the same thing, right?

774
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,880
I'm afraid the craftsman that made this fake

775
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,200
was too careless.

776
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,950
Really?

777
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,030
Look.

778
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,350
Look.

779
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,070
It's fake.

780
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,270
I knew

781
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,800
the real thing wouldn't be in your hands.

782
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,000
You jerk, Guo.

783
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,120
How dare you compete with a fake?

784
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,260
Beat him!

785
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,530
Beat him! Beat him!

786
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,190
Beat him! Beat him!

787
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,060
Beat him! Beat him!

788
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,070
Beat him!

789
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,210
Thief!

790
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,570
Are you trying to fish in troubled waters?

791
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,910
I, Chunshan,

792
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,130
am a man of integrity and pirde.

793
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,190
How can I be a thief?

794
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,200
The silver ingots are mine in the first place.

795
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,750
Ask them if you don't believe me.

796
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,560
Stop it!

797
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,750
He may die!

798
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
Stop fighting!

799
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,010
Deputy President of the Supreme Court,

800
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,270
Lu Lingfeng!

801
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,950
Beat him!

802
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,570
The former, I mean.

803
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,080
He asked you to stop fighting.

804
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,710
Why are you still fighting?

805
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,270
He...

806
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,240
He's a high-ranking official from the capital.

807
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,340
We didn't know you're a high-ranking official from the capital.

808
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,030
We are ignorant.

809
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,320
It's okay.

810
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,110
Since it's a fake,

811
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,110
what should we do about the fake

812
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,710
according to the treasure competition rules?

813
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,640
This...

814
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,990
This has never happened.

815
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,230
How about we do

816
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,790
whatever you say, Your Honor?

817
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,910
Although you call it treasure competition,

818
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,110
it's actually gambling.

819
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,040
It's a bad habit.

820
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,520
It should be banned.

821
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,350
In my opinion,

822
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,910
all the treasures and money

823
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,570
on the table

824
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,070
should be returned to their owners.

825
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,000
Okay.

826
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,370
They've all been returned.

827
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,610
That's great.

828
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,240
I don't mean to flatter you,

829
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,250
but the Lu family of Fanyang

830
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,350
is really knowledgeable.

831
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,940
How did you know that multifaceted seal's a fake

832
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,970
at a glance?

833
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,700
That Mr. Guo had a fake,

834
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,060
yet he was so arrogant.

835
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,680
I almost believed him.

836
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,110
It's all thanks to you, Lu Lingfeng.

837
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,550
I've never studied antiques, calligraphy or painting.

838
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,080
I was just

839
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,310
gyping him

840
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,780
If he wasn't guilty,

841
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,590
he'd argue.

842
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,110
But since he felt guilty,

843
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,940
he got caught.

844
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,590
Lu Lingfeng.

845
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,380
You also gyp people now.

846
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,739
Ever since you met Su Wuming,

847
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,150
you've gone bad.

848
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,350
What's wrong?

849
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,110
Look at those 3 people

850
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,840
and 3 horses.

851
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,050
They must have something urgent.

852
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,510
We should get on our way too, don't you think?

853
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,910
You go back first.

854
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,220
Magistrate has something important to do.

855
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,280
He has no time to mess around with you.

856
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,260
I don't understand.

857
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,750
Go get Lou Qingtai.

858
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:10,940
Qingniao.

859
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,240
Come here.

860
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,850
What now?

861
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,710
Your brother

862
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,510
has only been missing for a day.

863
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,430
He's not considered missing.

864
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,760
Go back and wait at home.

865
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,470
What's wrong?

866
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,600
Magistrate.

867
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,660
This is Lou Lide's daughter, Qingniao.

868
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,650
Her case isn't serious.

869
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,850
Don't worry about it.

870
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,630
Young lady.

871
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,740
Take your time.

872
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,750
Tell me what happened?

873
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,910
She's a mute.

874
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,940
I can understand a little bit of what she wants to say.

875
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,740
I'll convey what she says to you.

876
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,550
She said

877
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,880
her older brother,

878
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,030
Lou Qingtai,

879
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,200
went out yesterday afternoon

880
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,600
and hasn't come back yet.

881
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,510
She said that, after the rain stopped yesterday,

882
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,800
she even went to

883
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,500
Dugu Yang's burial goods store,

884
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,750
but she couldn't find him.

885
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,530
She's worried that

886
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,530
something happened to her brother.

887
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,600
Young lady.

888
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,590
You can hear what we say,

889
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,180
right?

890
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,180
You went to Lingdu Burial Goods Store?

891
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,900
Why did you go there

892
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,300
to look for your brother?

893
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,350
Here's the thing.

894
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,610
Lou Lide died a sudden death few days ago.

895
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,390
Her brother Lou Qingtai

896
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,430
suspected his father was poisoned by Ma Huai.

897
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,910
Who is Ma Huai?

898
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,710
A businessman who sells naans.

899
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,550
His father is Ma Laoshi.

900
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,550
His parents were both tomb robbers.

901
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,310
His parents

902
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,350
were arrested one after another.

903
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,350
They were both sentenced to death

904
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,270
and have been executed.

905
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,150
It was Lou Lide who executed them.

906
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,860
Lou Lide!

907
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,050
You killed both my parents.

908
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,570
I'll kill you sooner or later.

909
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,490
Coincidentally,

910
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,720
before Lou Lide died,

911
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,750
he had a naan.

912
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,480
So Lou Qingtai accused Ma Huai

913
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,660
of poisoning his father.

914
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,050
Dugu Yang performed postmortem

915
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,000
and concluded that Lou Lide

916
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
died of angina.

917
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,410
Lou Qingtai didn't buy it,

918
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,390
saying that Dugu Yang must have taken money from Ma Huai.

919
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,300
So he put the body

920
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,520
in the government office

921
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,970
and wouldn't stop making trouble.

922
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,160
He didn't respect

923
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,390
the authority of the government office at all.

924
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,320
That's why I said

925
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,830
you don't have to worry about it, Magistrate.

926
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,230
Why is it so complicated?

927
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,160
Although it's a bit complex,

928
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,950
I think I understand it now.

929
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,770
You want to ask Coroner Dugu for your brother?

930
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,390
He's already dead.

931
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,280
So if

932
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,590
what you just said is true,

933
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,660
it's very likely

934
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,020
that Dugu Yang was killed by your brother.

935
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,710
You...

936
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,950
She said

937
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,290
Lou Qingtai

938
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,350
must have been running other errands.

939
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,750
He didn't go get even with

940
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,700
Dugu Yang at all.

941
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,130
Their whole family

942
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,990
is a bit crazy.

943
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,160
You frightened her.

944
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,990
How would she dare to tell the truth?

945
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,230
Assistant Xu.

946
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,760
This is related to Dugu Yang's case.

947
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,130
This is an important clue.

948
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,980
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

949
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,770
I didn't think of this.

950
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,830
Then go check on the Lou family

951
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,350
and see

952
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,750
if Lou Qingtai will come back today.

953
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,750
Yes.

954
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,120
Keep an eye on Chuntiao too.

955
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,210
Given what she said

956
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,400
in the government office,

957
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,730
she's very suspicious.

958
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,140
I'll keep an eye on her myself.

959
00:38:59,230 --> 00:38:59,790
Mr. Su.

960
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,170
Sorry for that.

961
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,070
But since you came,

962
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,510
everyone in the government office has been doing their job.

963
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,110
Everyone has worked harder.

964
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,400
Thanks a lot.

965
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,180
It's necessary that we go to Coroner Dugu's house.

966
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,320
As the magistrate,

967
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,990
you should visit and comfort

968
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,040
his old mother.

969
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,510
Also,

970
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,550
maybe we can find

971
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,630
some new clues.

972
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,530
I understand

973
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,870
what you mean, Mr. Su.

974
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,810
We're here.

975
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,490
We're here already?

976
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,180
I didn't expect it to be so close to the government office.

977
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,620
Don't be afraid, Mr. Su.

978
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,990
She was a coroner before,

979
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,390
so naturally, she carries some Yin energy.

980
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,230
Greetings, Madam. I'm Su Wuming.

981
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,730
I'm the new magistrate, Dugu Xiashu.

982
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,980
Greetings, Madam.

983
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,910
Magistrate?

984
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,920
Have you seen my son?

985
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,630
His name is Dugu Yang.

986
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,820
He didn't come home all night.

987
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,820
I was going to look for him.

988
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,510
Madam.

989
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,050
Dugu Yang

990
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,950
is dead.

991
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,990
My son is dead?

992
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,030
I'll do postmortem for him.

993
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,190
You've done that.

994
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,670
Right, I have.

995
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,180
The postmortem records

996
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,190
should be submitted to the magistrate.

997
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,450
Then we can find

998
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,710
the murderer...

999
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,320
Madam.

1000
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,570
What were you thinking,

1001
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,010
taking a fake to the treasure competition?

1002
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:07,790
The mirror,

1003
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,670
the gold bowl,

1004
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,830
and especially the silver sachet

1005
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,070
were all good stuff.

1006
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,990
I was worried that they wouldn't give them to us

1007
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,270
if we didn't offer enough money.

1008
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,610
That's why you used a fake to trick them?

1009
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,000
You said that

1010
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,830
a treasure

1011
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,980
like Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal

1012
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,300
may just be a legend?

1013
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,950
Since no one has seen it,

1014
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,870
so what if I tricked them?

1015
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:31,980
Come here.

1016
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,100
Boss.

1017
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,110
I did this for you.

1018
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,630
All these years,

1019
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,340
you've spent a lot of money.

1020
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,090
I feel bad for you.

1021
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,790
You don't feel bad for me.

1022
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,470
You're trying to ruin

1023
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,390
the reputation of Treasure Pavilion.

1024
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,600
I dare you to trick people with fakes ever again!

1025
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,360
You ruined Treasure Pavilion's reputation.

1026
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,330
How dare you lie!

1027
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,890
[Treasure Pavilion]

1028
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,670
How dare you lie!

1029
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,600
How dare you lie!

1030
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,760
What's going on, Boss Dong?

1031
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,790
Guo here

1032
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,760
used a fake in the treasure competition

1033
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,230
for his own benefit,

1034
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,490
and tried to swindle real antiques from our fellows.

1035
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,490
He's gone too far.

1036
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,590
I've expelled

1037
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,090
this despicable man from Treasure Pavilion.

1038
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:10,750
Everyone.

1039
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,640
If anyone

1040
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,870
bought anything fake from him,

1041
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,350
please come to me.

1042
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,590
I, Dong,

1043
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,960
will compensate according to the cost

1044
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,390
even if I go broke.

1045
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,710
Good! Good!

1046
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,920
Thank you.

1047
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,540
Thank you.

1048
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,430
Get lost.

1049
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,640
Go out and greet

1050
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,490
Lady Dugu.

1051
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,270
Remember.

1052
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,500
Invite her in

1053
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,910
after everyone leaves.

1054
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,820
Clean up upstairs

1055
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,680
and take out the best tea.

1056
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,230
Okay.

1057
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,350
Witnessing one's child die before oneself

1058
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,870
is the hardest torture in the world.

1059
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,400
But

1060
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,670
at this point,

1061
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,710
please don't be too sad.

1062
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,790
I'm Cao Hui, a female coroner in Shiyang.

1063
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,350
I've done postmortem for more than 20 years,

1064
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,730
and I always reveal the truth of murder cases.

1065
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,360
My son

1066
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,610
wasn't stabbed by his clay figurines.

1067
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,150
Why are you here

1068
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,800
instead of tracking down the murderer, Magistrate?

1069
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,190
She gains

1070
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,460
sanity

1071
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,750
from time to time.

1072
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:48,870
Madam.

1073
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,660
Is your daughter-in-law, Chuntiao,

1074
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,720
still not back yet?

1075
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,010
She?

1076
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,340
Since my son died,

1077
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,820
she's become even crazier.
