4
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,550
Well, Song Ami.

5
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,080
How dare you cheat on me with someone else behind my back!

6
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,590
It wasn't me!

7
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,830
It was him!

8
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,510
Who are you?

9
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,280
Do you have a death wish?

10
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,020
Sir, please don't misunderstand.

11
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,030
This woman, she...

12
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,030
You have no rights

13
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,320
to point fingers at my woman.

14
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,210
Let me tell you.

15
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,910
Judicial Adjutant Ma Meng

16
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,030
is my old friend.

17
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,270
Do you want to end up in prison?

18
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,870
No, no, please don't.

19
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,050
Refund me my money.

20
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,860
It was even said that the assassin

21
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,990
was from Taiyin Sect

22
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,470
and had powerful backers behind him,

23
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,530
so he charged more.

24
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,070
He ended up dying in our well.

25
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,190
If you guys hadn't gone in to stay,

26
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,250
his body would've rotted away without anyone knowing.

27
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,350
Back then, I also had the chance

28
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,470
to marry a scholar,

29
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,010
but I was tempted by Long Fa's wealth.

30
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,410
I was afraid of living a hard life,

31
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,630
but in the end,

32
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,870
I suffered even more.

33
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,960
Yingtao, you...

34
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,800
Yingtao!

35
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,510
What is it?

36
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,329
She isn't your attendant?

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,790
Is she your wife or concubine then?

38
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,060
Neither.

39
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,710
You're lying too.

[Long's Residence]

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,310
I had no choice

42
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,910
but to disguise myself like this

43
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,370
Otherwise, with my bruised face,

44
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,460
I look scary.

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,530
I've wanted to kill him for a long time.

46
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,190
That day, he said he would leave at dusk.

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,630
I went to the Liaoshi Hall early in the morning.

[Liaoshi Hall]

49
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,640
Why are you showing me this?

50
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,770
This is the emblem of Taiyin Sect.

51
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,250
You can't even join the sect

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,900
if your martial arts skills is only average.

53
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,750
In that case,

54
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,670
he must be very skilled.

55
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,300
Of course.

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,920
He has never failed.

57
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,030
So,

58
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,830
you'll have to pay 30% more.

59
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,530
Fine, I'll pay extra.

60
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,540
You must do a good job for me.

61
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,230
Don't worry, I guarantee it.

62
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,330
He'll disappear without a trace.

63
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,670
When you came to me

64
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,870
saying that a body was found,

65
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,620
I even thought he had succeeded.

66
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,110
Brother.

67
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,380
The case seems to be clear now.

68
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,990
Long Fa is a gambling addict.

69
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,030
Every time he loses money,

70
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,290
he would beat his wife.

71
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,310
Ami had endured it for many years.

72
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,520
Unable to bear anymore suffering,

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,670
she hired an assassin to get rid of her husband.

74
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,230
However,

75
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,830
that assassin killed by Long Fa instead.

76
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,870
Now, we just need to find Long Fa.

77
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,460
Up until this point, I think the investigation

78
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,470
is almost done.

79
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,230
After all, the deceased was not a good person.

80
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,550
In a homicide investigation,

81
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,190
the deceased's identity should not be in consideration

82
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,050
when determining right or wrong.

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,520
Well said.

84
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,590
Is this also what your respected teacher,

85
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,920
Detective Di, had said?

86
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,110
This was just said by the future Master Lu

87
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,210
a moment ago.

88
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,670
Ami.

89
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,800
Long Fa's cruelty is certainly detestable,

90
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,580
but you really shouldn't have hired an assassin.

91
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,060
You're caught up in the sins of the wicked,

92
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,750
and in the end, you'll fall into hell yourself.

93
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,510
Do you want to be destroyed

94
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,860
together with him?

95
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,920
But what else

96
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,430
can I do?

97
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,970
Why don't you divorce him?

98
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,830
Divorce?

99
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,300
If you trust me,

100
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,470
I can help you draft the letter of divorce.

101
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,110
But...

102
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,500
isn't it too late now?

103
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,910
I hired an assassin.

104
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,290
Isn't that a capital offence?

105
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,510
These are two separate matters.

106
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,590
When the case comes to light,

107
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,700
you will receive fair judgment.

108
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,760
However,

109
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,210
this doesn't stop you

110
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,010
from dissolving your marriage.

111
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,750
Ami.

112
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,159
Although I asked you to go back,

113
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,310
you cannot leave Hanzhou without permission.

114
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,430
Can I really

115
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,780
divorce him?

116
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,670
Of course you can.

117
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,620
Didn't my sworn sister just say

118
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,750
she would help you prepare the documents?

119
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,880
After I divorce him,

120
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,950
can I still get married to someone else?

121
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,950
Of course you can.

122
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,150
I want to marry...

123
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,270
a scholar like you.

124
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,710
Song Ami.

125
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,430
You've no shame, don't you?

126
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,510
He said

127
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,190
you are neither his wife

128
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,190
nor his concubine.

129
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,350
What does my nonsense

130
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,070
have to do with you?

131
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,750
You...

132
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,430
Ami.

133
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,790
You should flee now.

134
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,870
Otherwise, they will really arrest you.

135
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,690
Let go of my hand.

136
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,350
Ami.

137
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,870
I just don't want you to go to jail.

138
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,310
Let go!

139
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,670
I've already promised Su Wuming.

140
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,130
How can I go back on my word?

141
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,330
You should go.

142
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm not leaving.

143
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,550
At a time like this,

144
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,350
I should stay with you even more.

145
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,750
Let me be frank.

146
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,030
After I divorce Long Fa,

147
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,230
I can't be with you either.

148
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:32,990
You...

149
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,150
Why?

150
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,770
Just because I'm Long Fa's younger brother?

151
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,030
If you truly see Long Fa as an elder brother,

152
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,170
how could you have taken a fancy on me?

153
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,110
It's because Ami, you...

154
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,830
are too lovable.

155
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:52,950
Ami.

156
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,360
Marry me!

157
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,230
I will protect you for life

158
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,290
and never let anyone bully you again.

159
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,630
Although Long Fa is my elder brother,

160
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,160
but with how he treated you,

161
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,510
if he dares to come back,

162
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,190
I will definitely kill him.

163
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,230
Who is this?

164
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,150
Long Fa.

165
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,550
Only he knocks like this.

166
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,110
Didn't you say he went out

167
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,990
to hide from debt collectors?

168
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,990
Why is he back now?

169
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,710
What should we do?

170
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
What should we do?

171
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,800
Hurry and get a knife.

172
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Why do we need a knife?

173
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,200
What else can we be doing?

174
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,890
Go wait by the door.

175
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
As soon as he comes in,

176
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,710
stab him from behind.

177
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Are you crazy?

178
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,350
You have to kill him for me.

179
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,920
That's what you said just now.

180
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,750
Ami!

181
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,590
If you're going to open the door for him,

182
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,930
what... what about me?

183
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,160
If I don't open the door, he will beat me to death.

184
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,310
As for you,

185
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,830
whatever happens, it's between both of you as men.

186
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,560
I don't care.

187
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,320
No good!

188
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,470
Long Fa!

189
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,070
Long Fa is at the dye shop.

190
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,190
Go catch him quickly!

191

right at the start of the 11th hour.

then this person

225

won't be easy to deal with either.

Is this appropriate?

382
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,190
If we were to spar

383
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,230
and you were empty-handed,

384
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,230
I would certainly put down my spear.

385
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,920
But when dealing with rebels like you,

386
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,670
how can I go easy?

387
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,160
Are you alright?

388
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,530
Thank you, Sheriff Lu.

389
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,470
You are indeed a man of your word.

390
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,210
That line from you,

391
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,270
"I am a blacksmith of the Tang Dynasty."

392
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,990
Hearing that makes my blood boil with excitement.

393
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,850
I have the utmost respect for you.

394
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,360
It's just a pity that

395
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,430
I can forge

396
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,670
the best Heng sword in the Tang Dynasty,

397
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,330
but I don't have martial arts skills like you do.

398
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,700
Stop right there, traitor!

399
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,380
I have to go.

400
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,680
Wu Ping.

401
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,640
You also went to the smithy.

402
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,420
Yes.

403
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,410
I want to make amends for my crimes

404
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,810
by secretly supporting you, Major Linghu.

405
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,670
Then why didn't you lend a hand?

406
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,720
What?

407
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,710
You were there to mock me.

408
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,830
Major, please spare my life.

409
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,830
I, Wu Ping, wouldn't dare to mock you

410
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,270
No, no, don't.

411
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,150
I...

412
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,530
I know the guy wielding the spear.

413
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,920
It's such a trivial matter,

414
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,590
but Linghu Shuo actually failed.

415
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,230
Exactly.

416
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,120
I suspect Major Linghu

417
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,150
did it on purpose.

418
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,900
If he wanted to capture a blacksmith,

419
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,230
why didn't he take action three days ago?

420
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,910
He even revealed

421
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,370
the time he would go today.

422
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,910
Wasn't that waiting for the government

423
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,970
to set up an ambush?

424
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,630
Lieutenant Yuan,

425
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,870
think about it.

426
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,870
Think carefully.

427
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,850
[Taiyin Sect's Lieutenant Yuan]

428
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,560
Linghu Shuo greets you, Lieutenant Yuan.

429
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,190
Linghu Shuo.

430
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,540
The sect leader suspects your disloyalty.

431
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,910
It was Captain Luo who filed a complaint against me

432
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,470
in front of Lieutenant Yuan, wasn't it?

433
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,590
So what if I did?

434
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,590
I reported truthfully.

435
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,510
You mobilized such a huge force

436
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,120
just to capture one blacksmith.

437
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,270
You pretended to let our brothers

438
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,590
lure away the officials and soldiers for you,

439
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,350
but in fact,

440
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,130
you just wanted to harm us.

441
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,930
If our brothers were imprisoned,

442
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,000
wouldn't Taiyin Sect suffer?

443
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,620
Arresting a blacksmith

444
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,710
indeed does not require mobilizing such a huge force.

445
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,150
See,

446
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,380
he has admitted it!

447
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:37,750
But,

448
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,300
if we want to lure out the culprit

449
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,470
who destroyed our Qianchong Dock sub-division,

450
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,330
isn't it worth taking some risks?

451
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,880
Captain Luo.

452
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,950
In our Taiyin Sect, it has always been

453
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,550
those with merits who get promoted.

454
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,950
If you want to bring me down

455
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,880
and climb to the position of major,

456
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,950
you'll need to work your brain more.

457
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,340
You!

458
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,000
Come on.

459
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,390
Come.

460
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,950
Let's drink.

461
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,000
Although that, well...

462
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,230
we didn't capture

463
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,200
the leader of Taiyin Sect,

464
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,030
but at least we met him face to face.

465
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,060
Tell Xijun

466
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,500
to draw his portrait out tomorrow,

467
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,990
and then give it to the prefectural governor.

468
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,120
Wouldn't that be a great achievement?

469
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,000
That man is quite young.

470
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,000
He can't be the sect leader.

471
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,590
But his qinggong is very good.

472
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,200
He don't need swords or spears.

473
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,030
He's extremely skilled just with his fists and palms,

474
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,490
especially his left hand.

475
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,150
Left hand?

476
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,390
Long Fa!

477
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,390
Long Fa!

478
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,270
What happened to him?

479
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:55,910
Long Fa...

480
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,400
Long Fa took Cao Shuangli away.

481
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,230
Ami.

482
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,590
I've thought it through.

483
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,910
I still want to marry you.

484
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,750
Why don't we elope?

485
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,830
Let's leave Hanzhou.

486
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,330
Through these years,

487
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,010
I've made some money at the Property Agency.

488
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,430
With my business skills,

489
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,070
even if we go to Chang'an or Luoyang,

490
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,400
I can still support you.

491
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,990
This is the first time

492
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,910
you've been so resolute.

493
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,500
So you're the adulterer.

494
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,510
Cao Shuangli!

495
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:29,970
Brother!

496
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,120
Who's your brother?

497
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,670
Bro...

498
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,450
Brother, please spare my life!

499
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,270
Long Fa...

500
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,900
gagged Cao Shuangli's mouth,

501
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,130
so he couldn't make a sound.

502
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,800
He also tied up his hands and feet,

503
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,260
and said he would skin him,

504
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,910
scrape off all the flesh from his body,

505
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,840
and extract the oil from his bones.

506
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,310
That's terrifying.

507
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,670
What kind of killing method is this?

508
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,120
This is how hunters

509
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,550
handle wild beasts after killing them.

510
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,190
Ami.

511
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,510
I remember you mentioned

512
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,350
that Long Fa has a Animal Bone Yard.

513
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:06,750
Yes.

514
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,760
Quickly take us there.

515
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,540
[Animal Bone Yard]

516
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,460
Nothing.

517
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,790
In this Animal Bone Yard,

518
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,190
not even a single animal's bone can be seen.

519
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,910
That's not right.

520
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,190
I was just here a few days ago.

521
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,870
Piles of animal bones were

522
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,530
scattered all over the place.

523
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,590
I get it now.

524
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,450
Long Fa must have sold this place.

525
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,640
He lost money again.

526
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,240
That's why he wanted the land deed.

527
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,230
He wanted to sell this Animal Bone Yard,

528
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,160
so that he has money to gamble with.

529
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,910
It seems that all the animal bones have been transported away.

530
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,810
Who's there?

531
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,590
Why didn't you bring your spear tonight?

532
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,750
Lu Lingfeng of Fanyang.

533
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,700
The new sheriff of Yunding County.

534
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,090
It's you, isn't it?

535
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,250
That's him.

536
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,470
Major.

537
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,760
Let me avenge my brothers

538
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,990
from Qianchong Dock!

539
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,150
If you avenge a mob

540
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,270
but lose the chance to seize the world,

541
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,430
then the leader of Taiyin Sect

542
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,630
must also be useless!

543
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,330
Stop!

544
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,070
Major Linghu,

545
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,410
don't be deceived.

546
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,490
Kill him quickly and let's go.

547
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,510
On the account that he slandered our sect leader,

548
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,970
we must kill him of course.

549
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,550
I just want to know

550
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,570
about this so-called chance to seize the world.

551
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,470
What is it?

552
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,310
After leaving Chang'an, I headed west all the way,

553
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,910
and I came because I admired Hanzhou's Taiyin Sect

554
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,770
and the sect leader's great name.

555
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,230
If you take me to see him,

556
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,430
then you'll know everything.

557
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,470
The sect leader meets whoever he wants to meet.

558
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,670
Hurry up and kill him.

559
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,550
Don't cause trouble.

560
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,110
Luo Qian!

561
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,550
As a captain,

562
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,280
giving orders in front of the major

563
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,820
is insubordination.

564
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,830
What should be the punishment?

565
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,830
So you're afraid of death too.

566
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,140
I'm not afraid.

567
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,560
I'm just feeling aggrieved.

568
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,590
Since you already know my identity,

569
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,320
it shouldn't be hard to find out

570
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,990
how I left Chang'an.

571
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,160
If you don't believe me,

572
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,900
then just kill me.

573
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,020
Anyway, after leaving Chang'an,

574
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,110
every day I'm alive

575
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,710
is already a bonus.

576
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,030
Major.

577
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,520
Don't be deceived.

578
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,880
Let me take revenge.

579
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,910
Lu Lingfeng, let me ask you

580
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,310
about this so-called chance to seize the world.

581
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,950
What is it?

582
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,230
If you don't share,

583
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,710
then you'll die.

584
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,520
Unless you are

585
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,030
the leader of Taiyin Sect,

586
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,590
where otherwise, I'll die either way,

587
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,190
regardless if I share or not.

588
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,200
Wu Ping.

589
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,800
It was you who recognized Lu Lingfeng,

590
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,950
and if you personally

591
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,810
avenge Old Boat Officer and our brothers

592
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,130
at Qianchong Dock,

593
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,170
you will have made a great contribution.

594
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,470
In Taiyin Sect,

595
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,130
those with merit have always been promoted.

596
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,300
After tonight,

597
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,550
you will also become a captain.

598
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,020
Thank you, Major.

599
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,950
Lu Lingfeng.

600
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,490
What's wrong, Fed?

601
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,760
I had a dream.

602
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,320
I dreamt about Lu Lingfeng.

603
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,030
He...

604
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,630
What happened to him?

605
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,360
Impossible.

606
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,470
Impossible.

607
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,920
Lu Lingfeng's martial arts skills are superb.

608
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,000
He has no match in Hanzhou.

609
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,920
Impossible.

610
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,310
Impossible.

611
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,750
It seems that Animal Bone Yard

612
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,390
is a trap.

613
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,510
And the target

614
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,480
is none other than Lu Lingfeng.

615
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,060
But we just arrived in Hanzhou,

616
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,380
and haven't made any enemies yet.

617
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,240
Could it be that

618
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,630
the mastermind is still from Chang'an?

619
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,060
Cao Shuangli

620
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,640
was just like the corpse found in the well.

621
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,300
The back of the skull has caved in,

622
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,120
and he died from a heavy blow to the head.

623
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,910
I think

624
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,320
the murderer should be the same person.

625
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,800
And the autopsy this time can determine that

626
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,150
the murder weapon was not a hammer.

627
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,270
Why?

628
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,650
The back of the skull has caved in,

629
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,240
leaving a deep depression,

630
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,710
but the scalp around it was not damaged.

631
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,469
What kind of weapon could cause this?

632
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,670
I, Su Wuming, have never seen it before.

633
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,870
So there are masters in Hanzhou.

634
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,150
Then isn't Lu Lingfeng doomed?

635
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,860
Don't sprout nonsense!

636
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,710
I'm sorry, Chicken Fed.

637
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:28,710
I...

638
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,690
It's... it's okay.

639
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,270
I was talking nonsense.

640
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,670
I am sprouting nonsense.

641
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,510
Xijun.

642
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,110
You haven't slept all night.

643
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,469
Go rest early.

644
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,400
Lu Lingfeng has been through hundreds of battles.

645
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,679
This time in Hanzhou,

646
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,630
I'm sure he will definitely be able to avert disaster.

647
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,719
If he doesn't come back,

648
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,830
I dare not sleep.

649
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,810
Map of the Border's Troop Locations.

650
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,970
Where is the map?

651
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,510
Linghu Shuo.

652
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,750
He actually is that skilled at martial arts?

653
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,550
Indeed.

654
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,080
I was so scared at that time.

655
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,870
Who knows what else he is hiding?

656
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,970
He's too scary.

657
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,880
If such a person

658
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,210
is ever disloyal to you,

659
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,070
that won't be good.

660
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,560
I've warned you before.

661
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,270
This Linghu Shuo is arrogant about his achievements.

662
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,270
He has always wanted to replace you.

663
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,910
It's just that we are need of manpower.

664
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,360
Our Chief Commander

665
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,360
has a special appreciation for him.

666
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,100
If you had known it would come to this, why did you...

667
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,540
You...

668
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,150
You...

669
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,790
shouldn't have introduced him to our Chief Commander.

670
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,120
What's the use of saying these things now?

671
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,150
I know you want to climb up the ranks,

672
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,880
but you musn't overestimate your abilities.

673
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,680
Lieutenant!

674
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,230
I'm just worried about

675
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,140
your position.

676
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,870
Go pass my order.

677
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,910
Tell him to execute Lu Lingfeng immediately.

678
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,350
Yes!

679
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,550
Execute him?

680
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,540
But I have already found out

681
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,630
that the man surnamed Lu,

682
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,160
was indeed demoted and exiled from Chang'an.

683
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,440
He previously served as

684
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,110
General of the Imperial Guards,

685
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,520
and held important positions such as the Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

686
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,190
Moreover, he had close ties with

687
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,920
the newly enthroned Emperor,

688
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,680
and also

689
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,640
shares extremely close relations

690
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,890
with the princess who controls the court.

691
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,800
So what?

692
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,190
After we start the uprising,

693
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,630
we'll definitely use Hanzhou as our center,

694
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,350
and launch conquests in all directions.

695
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,080
At that time,

696
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,320
the court of Tang's Map of the Border's Troop Locations

697
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,950
will be an invaluable treasure.

698
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,690
If he really brought this map with him

699
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,290
to Hanzhou to seek refuge with our sect leader,

700
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,790
no amount of lives can replace his value

701
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,950
if we kill him now.

702
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,840
But what Lieutenant thinks is that

703
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,470
many things can happen overnight.

704
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,920
Don't let one Lu Lingfeng

705
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,390
bring big trouble

706
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,070
to Taiyin Sect.

707
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,510
Since it's not with him,

708
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,460
then it should probably be at this lodging.

709
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,310
You shall go.

710
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,040
Arrest all his accomplices

711
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,880
and search thoroughly.

712
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,030
Find that map for me.

713
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:33,790
But...

714
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,710
But Hanzhou is so big.

715
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,430
Who knows where he has been staying?

716
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,270
Searching all the inns

717
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,410
will expose us too easily.

718
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,690
Do you really think those people

719
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,550
who came from Chang'an are fools?

720
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,030
They didn't stay at any inn at all.

721
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:52,710
Here.

722
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,750
This is the address.

723
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,190
It's not here.

724
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,630
Nothing.

725
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,160
Nothing.

726
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,010
Nothing.

727
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:24,920
Retreat!

728
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,110
They're gone.

729
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,670
Come up.

730
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,910
Slowly.

731
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,400
Were there really assassins?

732
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,600
Five of them,

733
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,390
looking extremely vicious.

734
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,870
Su Wuming.

735
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,890
This time you saved my life.

736
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,110
We're even now.

737
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,350
By now,

738
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,740
it's probably not safe here either.

739
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,700
Don't be so dramatic.

740
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,310
Can you let me sleep for a while?

741
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,270
I'm talking about this very moment.

742
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:18,750
Fed.

743
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,100
If you want to drink for a few more decades

744
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,830
and eat a few thousand more chickens,

745
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,030
then follow me first.

746
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,800
We need to find a place to hide.

747
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,360
I'll go with you.

748
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,520
Lu Lingfeng!

749
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,940
You tricked us!

750
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,100
I caought

751
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,500
your other accomplices.

752
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,990
That guy named Su Wuming

753
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,790
has already confessed

754
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,190
after a round of torture.

755
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,670
You don't have the

756
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,570
Map of the Border's Troop Locations.

757
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,990
You just happened to know that know Taiyin Sect

758
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,740
will need this map

759
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,690
after the uprising,

760
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,890
so you made it up.

761
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,930
You tortured Su Wuming,

762
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,920
and then he just confessed?

763
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,740
That's right.

764
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,770
You overestimated this accomplice, didn't you?

765
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,470
What are you laughing at?

766
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,710
What I meant is...

767
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,910
You didn't even had to

768
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,020
torture him at all.

769
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,740
He will be so scared that he will kneel and beg for mercy,

770
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,140
and confess everything.

771
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,800
So, you must be lying to me.

772
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,620
You...

773
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,840
Major Linghu.

774
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,630
This subordinate of yours

775
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,910
is really useless.

776
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,610
Actually, what I just said

777
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,130
was to deceive him.

778
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,960
Although Su Wuming might be a scholar,

779
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,590
he has a strong will.

780
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,690
You can't even handle me.

781
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,530
So what can you do to him?

782
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,110
Drag him out

783
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,920
and bury him.

784
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,440
Don't you have anything to say?

785
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,590
I do not fear death,

786
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,430
but it would be a pity to leave with regrets.

787
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,750
I, Lu Lingfeng,

788
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,670
once devoted myself to serving the country.

789
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,390
From Chang'an to Luoyang,

790
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,500
who doesn't know my name?

791
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Yet I was framed by the treacherous,

792
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,920
and forced to head west,

793
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,350
I intended to bring the map of stationed troops

794
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,990
in order to seek refuge with an enlightened ruler.

795
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,390
But I never thought I would end up like this.

796
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,980
With my death today,

797
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,750
this map will no longer exist in the world.

798
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,790
That's fine too.

799
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,040
Bury him.

800
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,550
Stop!

801
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,680
Leave us.

802
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,090
Do you really have the map of the troop's locations?

803
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,180
It's said to be the Map of the Border's Troop Locations,

804
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,150
but in fact,

805
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,890
it only maps the Western Regions.

806
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,350
That's great.

807
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,950
Who drew it?

808
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,110
My cousin,

809
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,890
General Mingwei,

810
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,840
Xiao Bozhao.

811
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,670
Xiao Bozhao?

812
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,990
I think I know him.

813
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,040
He's in the Anxi Army, right?

814
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,010
You remembered wrong.

815
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,380
General Xiao is dead.

816
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,710
I remember now.

817
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,150
Isn't he some palace supervisor,

818
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,750
Xiao something?

819
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,860
You're mistaken again.

820
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,910
Xiao Bozhao was the former Minister of War,

821
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,150
son of Xiao Gao.

822
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,940
He's from the Qi Liang branch of the Xiao clan of Lanling.

823
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,470
Then where is the map?

824
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,700
In my heart.

825
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,070
In your heart?

826
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,870
I have had a photographic memory since I was a child.

827
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,830
In order not to arouse suspicion in Chang'an,

828
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,430
I memorized the map long ago.

829
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,960
I see.

830
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,070
Why don't you draw it for me?

831
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,670
I'll reward you with a hundred jin of gold coins.

832
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,000
Aren't you being ostracized by the court?

833
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,460
Why not take this gold

834
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:12,410
and live freely around the country from now on?

835
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:14,590
No.

836
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,950
What do you take us, the Lu family of Fanyang,

837
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,590
for?

838
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,780
Then what will it take for you to draw it?

839
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,950
Only those who collectively share a great cause

840
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,080
can obtain this map.

841
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,610
But the likes of you

842
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,310
are unworthy.

843
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,360
Major Linghu, stop wasting your breath on him.

844
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,870
Hurry and bury this madman alive.

845
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,600
How dare you!

846
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,270
Your superior says you're out of line.

847
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,400
Do you know why?

848
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,210
Taiyin Sect

849
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,850
was founded by the descendants of Duan Gui.

850
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,780
It aimed to be a big establishment.

851
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,670
Whoever obtains the map of the troop's locations,

852
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,030
is equivalent to controlling

853
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,590
half of the Western Regions.

854
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,430
How could a small punk like you

855
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,250
possibly comprehend that?

856
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:57,790
You...

857
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,730
What about him?

858
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,190
You're embarrassing us.

859
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,070
Don't let General Lu laugh at us.

860
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:02,630
Leave us.

861
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,490
My apologies, General Lu.

862
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,350
Let me pull you up.

863
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:07,750
Wait.

864
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,640
When can I meet the Sect Leader?

865
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,760
If it cannot be arranged quickly,

866
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,700
then you might as well bury me alive.

867
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,750
I, Lu Lingfeng,

868
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,750
have suffered great humiliation in Chang'an,

869
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,310
and have decided to rebel against the Tang.

870
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,440
If I cannot succeed,

871
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,830
I would rather die here.

872
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,710
General Lu, don't be impatient.

873
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,660
I, Linghu, will arrange it as soon as possible.
