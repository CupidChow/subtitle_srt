[Episode 6]

4
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,560
Come out together.

5
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,710
Immortal,

6
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,300
give me the treasure.

7
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,680
Immortal?

8
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,110
Why do you call me that?

9
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,360
You don't know the greeting rules.

10
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,910
Go away.

11
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,870
Don't make it so that

12
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,750
no one gets the treasure.

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,810
I asked a question.

14
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,550
Speak!

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,710
You can fly?

16
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,270
What else can you be?

17
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,040
We've come many times already.

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,260
We have enough gold and silver today.

19
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,110
I'll take as many treasures as you have.

20
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,270
Treasures are rare.

21
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,950
I will only sell to one person.

22
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,829
It will go to

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,390
the highest bidder.

24
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,670
Close your eyes.

25
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,090
If I take yours away,

26
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,470
you will get the treasure.

27
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,640
You want to

28
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,350
act mysteriously with these lowly tricks?

29
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,920
Let's go.

30
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,780
Remove his mask.

31
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,950
Bring Liang Zhi here.

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,430
Commander Hu.

33
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,160
It's him!

34
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,150
Take him away.

35
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,510
Commander Hu,

36
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,070
raise your head.

37
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,000
Let me show you something.

38
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,790
Look.

39
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,670
This is your portrait.

40
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,730
It was drawn by my sworn sister, Pei Xijun.

41
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,670
But she could tell immediately

42
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,380
that even though your hair was down

43
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,490
and you had a fake beard,

44
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,290
you looked like the owner of Cloud Tower,

45
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,630
Bi Chengye.

46
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,950
Under my sworn brother's orders,

47
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,050
I drew another portrait

48
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,220
without a beard.

49
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,070
Look.

50
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,560
Is this you?

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,510
Rip off his beard.

52
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,030
Su Wuming,

53
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,870
how did you know it was me?

54
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,520
I'll pay for his drinks.

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,760
Your clothing was so strange.

56
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,550
Can the Cloud Tower

57
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,070
be entered by anyone?

58
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,560
Many officials

59
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,270
frequent the place,

60
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,910
but only Liang Zhi

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,200
has seen Commander Hu.

62
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,610
Isn't that strange?

63
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,870
Furthermore,

64
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,790
every time you show up,

65
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,350
you laugh wildly.

66
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,590
Isn't it to

67
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,430
disguise your voice?

68
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,990
Unfortunately, you didn't know

69
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,350
my sworn brother has the sharpest hearing.

70
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,390
Yuan Lai, the mastermind of the Chang'an black tea case,

71
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,420
wore a mask,

72
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,430
but he only said one thing

73
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,100
before my sworn brother recognized his voice.

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,540
So when I saw you here last time,

75
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,580
I guessed who you were.

76
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,390
You pretended to be the Military Commander of Zhexi.

77
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,990
Did you go astray

78
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,480
for the sake of politics?

79
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,790
I came to Chang'an to be an official.

80
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,020
You failed as an official,

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,870
so you're making a fortune selling Flying Light.

82
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,820
The Shenzhu Painting Shop you opened

83
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,830
must have costed a lot of money.

84
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,580
I didn't pay for that.

85
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,430
My Lord is resourceful.

86
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,730
He will reorganize the court.

87
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,730
You'd better release me.

88
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,950
By then,

89
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,030
I can spare your lives.

90
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,750
Who is "My Lord"?

91
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,750
You don't deserve to know.

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,790
Search his body for the Flying Light.

93
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,150
No need to search.

94
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,200
I don't have it.

95
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,480
You didn't even produce the Flying Light.

96
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,990
You're here to cheat people of their money.

97
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,450
How is that possible?

98
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,510
Xu Zhiyun, Minister of Rites from the Court of Imperial Sacrifices,

99
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,150
produced a batch of quality Flying Light.

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,280
The craftsmanship is excellent.

101
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,060
Although it's a small supply,

102
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,120
it can be used for the finishing touch

103
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,630
of the Mara's Defeat of Chengfo Temple.

104
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,750
Mara's Defeat!

105
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,750
Mara's Defeat?

106
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,470
Nobody inquiries after one falls.

107
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,010
What do you know of destruction?

108
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,060
The value of one's life

109
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,470
can change in an instant.

110
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,350
You drugged my wine.

111
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,760
What are you going to do?

112
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
What else can I do?

113
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,840
I've worked under you for 13 years.

114
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,909
I've already mastered the skill of Danqing.

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,270
Tomorrow,

116
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,130
I'll stun the world.

117
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,590
What nonsense are you spouting?

118
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,110
Release me!

119
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,150
This is the treasure,

120
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,460
Flying Light.

121
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,470
You finally got this evil thing.

122
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,550
What are you doing?

123
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,590
To add the finishing touch, of course.

124
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,270
If I do anything wrong,

125
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,290
Senior,

126
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,570
you can teach me.

127
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,140
No, no, no.

128
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,670
You want to use this evil thing

129
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,430
to taint my Mara's Defeat.

130
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,990
Zu, how dare you?

131
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,180
My name is not Zu.

132
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,430
My surname is Yu.

133
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,550
I'm a descendant of a noble family of the six dynasties.

134
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,080
If my grandfather hadn't offended Wu Zetian,

135
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,170
would I have become a slave

136
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,190
and need you to save me?

137
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,470
I used to truly like

138
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,659
the name Zu.

139
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,670
It made me dare not insult my ancestors.

140
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,750
You gave me freedom

141
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,750
and let me call you Senior.

142
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,110
I wanted to learn to paint from you forever.

143
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,960
I would've gone to the ends of the earth without hesitation.

144
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,310
But you never saw

145
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,060
my respect for you!

146
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,750
You treated me, your junior,

147
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,150
as a lowly slave!

148
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,710
Have you gone mad?

149
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,600
Release me!

150
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,830
You don't treat me as a human,

151
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,080
but others will respect me.

152
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,900
Do you really think Mara

153
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,830
can escape from the wall?

154
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,539
No.

155
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,789
I drew it all,

156
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,710
stroke by stroke.

157
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,470
He parties

158
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,870
in Cloud Tower every day,

159
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,310
while you live so shabbily.

160
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,110
You...

161
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,320
Who are you?

162
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,090
The descendant of Yingchuan's Wei family

163
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,160
became a master of Danqing.

164
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,870
Congratulations.

165
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,890
How do you know my surname?

166
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,060
That person

167
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,900
was a friend of my father.

168
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,760
He had looked for me

169
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,840
since my family's crisis.

170
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,440
He wanted to help me.

171
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,750
He asked me to paint Mara for him.

172
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,070
He gave me huge golden cakes.

173
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Not only did I draw on masks

174
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,870
and armor,

175
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,480
but I also drew on people's faces.

176
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,890
Although that general was asleep,

177
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,470
he looked so powerful,

178
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,030
like the King of Hell.

179
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,560
You were the one

180
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,050
who painted the killer Mara.

181
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,150
Zu,

182
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,160
I taught you the Way of Danqing.

183
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,360
How dare you side with evil?

184
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,580
Do you want to lie down and watch me add the finishing touch?

185
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,470
Sure.

186
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,910
Stop.

187
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,710
Stop!

188
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,470
The crown prince and princess

189
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,030
will arrive at daybreak.

190
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,110
Someone has already cleared away

191
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,070
the monks here.

192
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,240
No one can hear you

193
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,990
no matter how you scream.

194
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,980
Don't bother.

195
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,410
The rope is tied tightly.

196
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,070
You can't break free.

197
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,140
The Flying Light was hard to produce.

198
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,550
It's the best type of paint.

199
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,040
You are the greatest painter in the world.

200
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,830
Don't you want to know

201
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,030
how I created it?

202
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,090
Before, I frequented painting shops

203
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,950
and pretended to buy Flying Light

204
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,000
just to

205
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,430
let everyone know

206
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,470
you've run out of talent.

207
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,630
Zu!

208
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,340
Zu, don't do it!

209
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,270
I beg you!

210
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,020
Zu!

211
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,500
You deserve this.

212
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,130
The time for the Mingyin Festival is up.

213
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,430
I've finished

214
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,270
what you couldn't.

215
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,270
After I add the finishing touch,

216
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,320
this will be my painting.

217
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,750
That old princess

218
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,710
won't trust you anymore.

219
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,310
The world

220
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,800
will come to support me

221
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,630
like they once did to you.

222
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,330
I will bring glory to my family

223
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,910
in another way.

224
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,480
I will carve my name

225
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,770
onto all the paintings

226
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,890
I've completed with you.

227
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,230
[Great Buddha Hall]

228
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,270
Wei Zhong.

229
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:04,830
Yes.

230
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,510
Arrange defenses first.

231
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,150
Yes.

232
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,090
Aunt,

233
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,870
I'm late.

234
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,590
No.

235
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,570
The timing is perfect.

236
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,760
Princess,

237
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,230
Crown Prince,

238
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,070
please.

239
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,790
Aunt, please.

240
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,480
Crown Prince, please.

241
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,750
Amitabha,

242
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,110
the time has come.

243
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,670
Your Highnesses,

244
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,460
please unveil the Mara's Defeat

245
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,320
for Chengfo Temple.

246
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,950
The demons are dancing

247
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,630
as if they're about to break out of the wall.

248
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,530
It's quite terrifying.

249
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,270
Qin Xiaobai!

250
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,430
How dare you trick the princess?

251
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,980
Your Highness, please look at the Buddha.

252
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,380
The finishing touch hasn't been added yet.

253
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,670
Amitabha.

254
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,620
Where is Qin Xiaobai?

255
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,710
Here.

256
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,930
Zu.

257
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,750
Zu.

258
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,360
Flying Light?

259
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:09,950
Guards!

260
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,480
Arrest Qin Xiaobai.

261
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,240
Why?

262
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,390
He didn't add the finishing touch.

263
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,849
You disobeyed the princess's order

264
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,119
and helped this rascal procrastinate.

265
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,150
You committed the same crime.

266
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,010
Take them down.

267
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,270
I have studied painting since young.

268
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,510
In my humble opinion,

269
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,470
although Mara's Defeat

270
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,920
seems to be incomplete,

271
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,650
it’s Qin Xiaobai’s

272
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,520
most genuine masterpiece.

273
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,150
Ms. Pei...

274
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,030
You know me well.

275
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,170
I delayed adding the finishing touch

276
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,060
because I had never

277
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,150
stepped onto an evil path.

278
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,180
I didn't understand a demon's craze

279
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,990
until...

280
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,070
That time,

281
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,170
my heart was in chaos

282
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,830
and I finally realized

283
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,810
there was no such thing as the way of the finishing touch.

284
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,080
The demons were myself.

285
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,960
All I needed to do is apply the ink.

286
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,540
However,

287
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,330
I've fallen into a demonic state.

288
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,790
I, Qin Xiaobai,

289
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,630
can't add the finishing touch for the Buddha anymore.

290
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,940
But I won't allow

291
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,430
others

292
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,680
to use their brush on this mural,

293
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,030
because

294
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,680
demons and monsters

295
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,520
can't enter the Buddha's eyes.

296
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,600
The Buddha has no demon in his sight

297
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,280
and there is definitely no demon in his heart.

298
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,270
There's no need to add the finishing touch.

299
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,270
I think

300
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,790
Qin Xiaobai is right.

301
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,590
Aunt,

302
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,120
we were shocked

303
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,310
when the mural was revealed.

304
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,330
We didn't even notice

305
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,630
whether the finishing touch was added or not.

306
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,270
It means it's well painted.

307
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,650
May I

308
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,170
say one more thing?

309
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,560
I think the Buddha without eyes

310
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,750
is what makes this mural

311
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,710
a masterpiece.

312
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,430
This may be Qin Xiaobai's greatest work

313
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,590
of his life.

314
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,830
And the last work

315
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,900
of my life.

316
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,680
Assassin!

317
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,290
Protect the Crown Prince!

318
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,870
Amitabha.

319
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,550
Master!

320
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,440
Qin Xiaobai,

321
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,670
why must you do this?

322
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,600
This mural was taken advantage of,

323
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,310
killing many people.

324
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,030
It’s my fault.

325
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,590
I can’t escape punishment.

326
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,550
Today, I destroyed my eyes

327
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,750
and will never draw again.

328
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,620
Princess, please

329
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,380
allow me

330
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,830
to bury

331
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,510
Zu.

332
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,800
There's a dead man lying there.

333
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,270
Amitabha.

334
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,750
What's going on?

335
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,710
Su Wuming,

336
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,750
how could you allow this?

337
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,110
The consecration ceremony today

338
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,100
is so inauspicious.

339
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,710
It's indeed my negligence.

340
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,030
Your Highnesses,

341
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,200
since the unveiling ceremony of the mural

342
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,510
has been completed,

343
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,430
please

344
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,230
exit.

345
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,110
Okay.

346
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,110
Princess,

347
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,220
the Crown Prince has something else to do.

348
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,160
He'll return to the Eastern Palace.

349
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,830
Your Highness,

350
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,360
this way.

351
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,510
Aunt,

352
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,670
I will take my leave.

353
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,350
With me here,

354
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,750
no one can leave.

355
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,940
I am here.

356
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,460
How dare you rebel?

357
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,750
Lu Tong, I know you're powerful.

358
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,750
I'm not needed to deal with you.

359
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,170
Protect the Crown Prince!

360
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,110
Cen Zhi!

361
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,660
Princess, don't panic.

362
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,680
Everything is under control.

363
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,920
Greetings, Godfather.

364
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,870
Today

365
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,050
is the time for my son to make contributions.

366
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,670
Don't worry, Godfather.

367
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,270
No one will be able to leave.

368
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,750
Who is he?

369
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,310
I...

370
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,160
I don't know either.

371
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,850
Where are your men?

372
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:39,790
I—

373
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,110
His men?

374
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,100
The thousands of my Mara Army will arrive immediately.

375
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,750
Starting with Chengfo Temple,

376
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,680
they will massacre Chang'an City.

377
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,390
Cen Zhi,

378
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,910
what is happening?

379
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,550
Your Highness,

380
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,490
let me speak for him.

381
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,990
After Cen Zhi arrived in the capital

382
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,010
as the regimental commander of the Princess' Palace,

383
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,430
many people appeared

384
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,440
in Chengfo Temple,

385
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,020
impersonating as monks

386
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,590
and behaving inappropriately

387
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,520
to the extent of

388
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,630
having conflicts with the people.

389
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,150
Abbot Guangxiao expelled them.

390
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,790
In one night,

391
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,990
they disappeared.

392
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,680
At the same time,

393
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,100
the Ghost Market became more flourishing

394
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,720
with bustling crowds

395
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,880
and teeming masses.

396
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,070
Even the courtesans

397
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,910
grew much younger.

398
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,370
Commander Cen,

399
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,750
you used

400
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,300
Bi Chengye, owner of Cloud Tower,

401
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,150
and hid all the people you recruited

402
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,150
into the Ghost Market.

403
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,990
Right?

404
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,950
This...

405
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,590
Unfortunately,

406
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,190
you didn't know

407
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,160
that Bi Chengye was already controlled

408
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,390
by the so-called My Lord.

409
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,400
Your men

410
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,810
all became

411
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,150
the Mara Army he mentioned.

412
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,350
Cen Zhi.

413
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,230
Princess.

414
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,870
I was foolish

415
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,070
and was cheated

416
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,190
by the profiteer Bi Chengye.

417
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:24,830
Wei Zhong,

418
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,650
why do you regard this enchanter as your Godfather?

419
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,710
Godfather arranged for me

420
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,470
to work in the Princess' Palace for years.

421
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,110
Importance wasn't placed upon me

422
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,800
until Commander Cen came.

423
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,340
Thank you.

424
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,250
Godfather,

425
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,800
I'll take the first credit.

426
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,860
Princess.

427
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,870
I will

428
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,340
die to atone my sins.

429
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,930
A great enemy is here.

430
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,530
Protect the princess first.

431
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,510
Kill!

432
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,750
Mara.

433
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,880
Your Highness, run!

434
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,800
Mr. Lu!

435
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,010
Your Highness,

436
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,440
I am here to fight the demon.

437
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,240
Leave!

438
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,750
Your Highness,

439
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,970
go through the window.

440
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,350
As the Crown Prince of Tang,

441
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,150
how can I escape from the window?

442
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,400
Bai Shan,

443
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,310
fight this demon with me and Mr. Lu.

444
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,400
No, Your Highness.

445
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,510
Mr. Lu!

446
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,620
Kill those two with the surname Li first.

447
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,470
Move!

448
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,240
Take this!

449
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,150
You better...

450
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,330
One, two, three.

451
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,230
My old bones almost

452
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,110
fell apart.

453
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,240
Luckily, I've consumed enough of

454
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,300
the most powerful knockout incense.

455
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,780
I can even knock Mara out,

456
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,440
let alone

457
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,400
a Qiongqi beast.

458
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,230
Come on.

459
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,300
Let me hug you.

460
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,030
Do you remember

461
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,690
the pepper I fed you last time?

462
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,590
Don't worry, General Ma.

463
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,630
This horse is fine.

464
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,980
It's just asleep.

465
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,190
We know

466
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,390
this horse was bestowed by the late emperor.

467
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,590
We won't hurt it.

468
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,930
General Ma has served the border for many years.

469
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,200
He bravely led the Anxi Army and killed countless enemies.

470
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,130
Unfortunately,

471
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,110
those flatterers stole the credit

472
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,070
for many of his military achievements.

473
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,270
He's had difficulty getting promoted.

474
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,220
Your Highness,

475
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,550
according to Bi Chengye's confession,

476
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,370
three months ago,

477
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,750
Ma Xiong was ambushed

478
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,430
when escorting the provisions.

479
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,400
Due to the disparity in strength, he could only retreat

480
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,790
and was sentenced to death.

481
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,320
He escaped late at night

482
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,190
to return to the capital

483
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,100
to seek justice.

484
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,980
I think

485
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,890
he was incited to rebel

486
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,110
on the way by this person

487
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,880
and controlled by evil poison.

488
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,660
You were ordered to act as Mara

489
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,070
and cause trouble to Chang'an,

490
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,710
right?

491
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,480
Don't listen to him.

492
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,830
Kill the enemy

493
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,830
and achieve the great cause.

494
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,790
Since the journey is far,

495
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,370
the documents from the Imperial Inspector

496
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,670
arrived only yesterday.

497
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,470
General Ma was indeed wronged.

498
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,710
Your Highness, please investigate it.

499
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
We must investigate the injustice.

500
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,280
Ma Xiong,

501
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,740
I will first pardon you for leaving Anxi without permission

502
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,340
and sneaking into Chang'an.

503
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,710
General Ma also returned to Chang'an

504
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,990
because he missed his wife.

505
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,620
The Black Balm produced with yuelin fragrance

506
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,820
must be from the Western Region.

507
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,150
Unfortunately,

508
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,230
General Ma could only

509
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,120
send it home secretly.

510
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,210
He didn't dare to reunite with his wife.

511
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:38,580
Su—

512
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,590
Don't mention that adulteress.

513
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,700
Adulterer.

514
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,430
General Ma!

515
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,670
Sun Wang deserved to be killed.

516
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,150
Mr. Lu went to investigate the case.

517
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,280
It's a misunderstanding.

518
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,480
A misunderstanding!

519
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,230
Ma Xiong,

520
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,990
this man has a glib tongue.

521
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,360
Don't listen to him.

522
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,270
Kill everyone here

523
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,690
and you'll be the Great General of the army!

524
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,400
Die!

525
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,060
Lu Lingfeng,

526
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,800
stop!

527
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,639
I want to avenge Guo Zhuang!

528
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,320
I understand how you feel.

529
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,630
Ma Xiong killed many people.

530
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,570
He's committed a capital crime,

531
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,980
but you can't kill him.

532
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,670
He must be imprisoned and testify

533
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,870
to leave no stone unturned in this case.

534
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,989
Open your mouth.

535
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,460
Kill!

536
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,750
Take off your mask

537
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,840
and surrender.

538
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,650
My Mara Army

539
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,830
will be here soon.

540
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,430
What are you being so arrogant about?

541
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,750
Those masses

542
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,810
are not worth mentioning.

543
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,420
Last night, I sneaked into

544
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,360
the Ghost Market

545
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,430
and found out

546
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,870
all of your hidden details.

547
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,530
Otherwise,

548
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,590
how could I disguise as a monster

549
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,950
and follow you here?

550
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,400
The first person who discovered

551
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,710
that there was something fishy in this hall

552
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,040
was the Director of the Ministry of Rites,

553
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,270
Mr. Li.

554
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,430
The monks are not monks.

555
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,360
The wall is not a wall.

556
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,350
The ears are not silent.

557
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,000
The heart is not calm.

558
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,580
Mr. Li must have figured out

559
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,390
some secrets of Chengfo Temple.

560
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,770
The villain was afraid of being exposed,

561
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,110
so they killed him.

562
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,750
When Qin Xiaobai focused on the finishing touch,

563
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,810
he often heard something strange in the stone wall

564
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,630
behind the Reclining Buddha,

565
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,430
which made him unable to focus.

566
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,080
My guess is that this hall

567
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,230
has long been connected

568
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,190
to the Ghost Market via a tunnel.

569
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,730
You planned all this, didn't you?

570
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,350
You wanted to rebel during the Mingyin Festival.

571
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,070
Last night,

572
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,570
Administrator Du Ming of Yongzhou

573
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,390
led an elite army

574
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,980
guided by Lu Lingfeng and Chicken Fed.

575
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,260
They set up

576
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,870
inescapable traps in the tunnel.

577
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,830
The Mara Army you mentioned

578
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,660
won't be coming.

579
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,460
Rebels,

580
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,190
there's no escaping!

581
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,310
Arrest

582
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,650
all these rebels.

583
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,910
Feng Han,

584
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,950
take off your mask.

585
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,110
Feng Han?

586
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,960
Chamberlain Feng?

587
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,110
Did His Majesty

588
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,660
arrange all of this?

589
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,420
Does he want me and his son

590
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,830
to die here?

591
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,470
Princess,

592
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,670
you misunderstood His Majesty.

593
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,880
His Majesty is benevolent.

594
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,450
He was instigated by Feng Han

595
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,430
during the Sky-scraping Tower case,

596
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,390
but His Majesty still refused to kill him

597
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,100
and released him from the palace,

598
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,010
sparing his life.

599
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,650
But His Majesty didn't know

600
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,940
that this evil eunuch has already entered

601
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,460
Anle Sect.

602
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,900
Anle Sect.

603
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,150
The evil organization

604
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,470
formed by eunuchs of the previous Sui Dynasty?

605
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,880
Emperor Yang of Sui killed his father and usurped power

606
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,680
after being instigated by them.

607
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,670
The Tang Dynasty has been established for nearly a century.

608
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,640
This evil sect

609
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,040
actually resurrected.

610
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,000
All disciples of the Anle Sect refer to their leader

611
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,230
as My Lord.

612
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,240
In addition,

613
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,560
Buddhism became popular during Emperor Wen of Sui's reign.

614
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,870
All temples competed in painting murals.

615
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,290
In order to profit,

616
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,520
the Anle Sect used human liver to make Flying Light.

617
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,510
Now this strange thing reappeared in Chang'an.

618
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,630
I have to suspect

619
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,620
the Anle Sect.

620
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,550
But Feng Han,

621
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,670
why do you only kill officials?

622
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,760
Those disgusting minor officials

623
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,900
either support the crown prince

624
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,140
or the princess.

625
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,230
None of them are loyal to the emperor.

626
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,510
Their livers are only worthy

627
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,480
of making Flying Light!

628
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,300
Illuminate the great Tang Dynasty

629
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,420
for centuries.

630
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,620
Cui,

631
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,790
next time,

632
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,070
I'll extract your liver to produce Flying Light.

633
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,110
It must be more valuable.

634
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,190
Su Wuming,

635
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,470
you made a conclusion

636
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,340
based on your speculations.

637
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,480
You didn't learn anything

638
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,670
from Di Renjie.

639
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,230
I admit

640
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,940
the aforementioned were just speculations.

641
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,150
But when Lu Lingfeng went to Leyou Plain

642
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,330
to look for Mr. Li's body,

643
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,590
he was attacked by a mupu.

644
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,550
Thus, I was sure

645
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,430
the person behind this conspiracy

646
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,180
must be from the Anle Sect.

647
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,190
Mupu?

648
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,310
What is that?

649
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,500
This beast has a snake head and turtle tail.

650
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,540
The giant ones can eat a human.

651
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,210
This strange beast was raised

652
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,350
by Anle Sect during the Sui Dynasty.

653
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,210
They often killed maids

654
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,230
to entertain Emperor Yang,

655
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,830
or suddenly appeared at banquets

656
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,230
to kill officials

657
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,710
to intimidate the others.

658
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:10,970
Feng Han,

659
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,270
you've been favored by Tang for many years,

660
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,220
but you secretly started performing

661
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,150
heresy from the previous dynasty.

662
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,100
What is your intention?

663
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,230
Feng Han,

664
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,750
how dare you!

665
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,070
How despicable!

666
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,910
I was

667
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,910
His Majesty's loyal servant.

668
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,320
Unfortunately,

669
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,320
His Majesty is useless.

670
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,730
The court is under your control.

671
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,330
If I succeed today,

672
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,310
the Anle Sect will reestablish Sui

673
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,060
and change the dynasty of the world!

674
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,630
Ji'er, save me!

675
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,130
Mother!

676
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,540
What did I do?

677
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,590
What did I do?

678
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,840
He said he wanted to clear my name,

679
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,310
but he actually harmed me.

680
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,280
Although he was controlled by evil medicine,

681
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,440
I could've cured him

682
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,940
with time.

683
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,390
[Chengfo Temple]

684
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:03,560
♫Thinking back, it's just like yesterday♫

685
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:10,330
♫It suddenly feels empty♫

686
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:17,010
♫How many lives are there♫

687
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:25,370
♫Year after year, there is constant unease♫

688
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:34,190
♫Thinking back, it's just like yesterday♫

689
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,450
♫It suddenly feels empty♫

690
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,400
The most depressing matter

691
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:47,020
♫How many lives are there♫

692
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,750
is farewells.

693
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,260
Sadness and melancholy are at the bend of the distant mountains,

694
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,300
♫Year after year, there is constant unease♫

695
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:53,780
walking farther and farther away beside the long river.

696
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,630
After leaving Chengfo Temple that day,

697
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,690
the princess went directly

698
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,490
to the palace to see His Majesty.

699
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,610
The Eastern Palace

700
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,530
also reported the entirety of the Chengfo Temple case

701
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,170
to His Majesty.

702
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,460
I said it.

703
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,010
What did you say?

704
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,790
Ji'er, save me!

705
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,420
Mother!

706
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,580
Are you sure you called her mother?

707
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,340
Yes.

708
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,180
Who heard it?

709
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,010
I don't know.

710
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,440
So you admitted the princess

711
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,880
is your birth mother?

712
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,790
I...

713
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,590
didn't admit it.

714
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,230
I was just in panic.

715
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,150
The princess called Ji'er.

716
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,400
There was chaos. No one would've noticed.

717
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,230
But I...

718
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:52,370
What situation

719
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:56,070
have I put the princess in?

720
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,790
At this point,

721
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,870
you still care about

722
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,250
the princess's situation,

723
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,770
instead of your own?

724
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:03,870
I...

725
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,090
Have you ever thought

726
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,540
about how

727
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,290
you will face the Crown Prince in the future?
