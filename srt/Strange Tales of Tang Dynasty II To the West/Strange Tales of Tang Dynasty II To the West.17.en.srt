[Episode 17]

4
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,590
During the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, floods were rampant.

5
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,550
The river surface was at least three times wider

6
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,590
than during the Six Dynasties period.

7
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,990
The depth was immeasurable.

8
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,590
Especially that whirlpool in the center of the river.

9
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,390
Fishing boats from nearby villages

10
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,420
or those privately owned boats

11
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,420

16
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,550
May I ask

17
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,350
about the whirlpool?

18
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,360
The whirlpool is right in the middle of the river.

19
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,350
Some say it's caused by the rapid currents and high winds,

20
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,470
while others say

21
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,360
it's because there are ferocious beasts lurking below.

22
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,390
Regardless of whether it's due to rapid currents and high winds

23
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,390
or ferocious beasts,

24
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,230
let me ask you.

25
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,840
Why are the official boats

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,510
safer then?

27
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,590
This...

28
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,950
I don't know

29
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,010
The ferocious beasts you mentioned.

30
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,870
Has anyone actually seen them?

31
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,000
I haven't seen them.

32
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,000
Just take it as my nonsense.

33
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,680
If you don't believe it,

34
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,230
then go ahead

35
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,390
and find a private boat to cross the river.

36
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,520
If you wait here for the official boat,

37
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,480
you'll need to sell your horses

38
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,010
and livestock.

39
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,340
Why is that?

40
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,860
Yeah.

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,750
why?

42
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,820
Official boats ferry people, not horses.

43
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,320
As for other livestock,

44
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,320
they are banned.

45
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,560

47
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,910

And it was even gifted by the magistrate of Shen County.

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,640
How can you

50
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,790
look down on it?

51
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,000
If ferrying people,

52
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,130
the ferocious beasts may not attack.

53
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,630
But if there are horses

54
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,410
or livestock on board,

55
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,110
then there's no escape.

56
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,750
Ferocious beasts love to eat livestock.

57
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,790
So according to what you're saying,

58
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,890
incidents of ferocious beasts attacking ferries

59
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,550
have indeed happened before.

60
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,510

63

Oh right,

64
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,310
just last month,

65
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,670
a border-patrolling censor was in a hurry

66
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,000
and didn't wait for the official boat.

67
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,250
As a result, he caused

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,390
the boatman and himself

69
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,430

Otherwise, the official boat won't wait when it arrives.

It's an old rule.

79

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,710
That's all

192
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,990
Could it be

193
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,110
that you also went to that Mo's Inn?

194
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,780
Exactly.

195
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,510
That remote inn

196
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,730
is very suspicious

197
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,950
I was in a hurry

198
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,750
and had no time to investigate thoroughly.

199
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,210
Waiter.

200
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,450
Bring me some water.

201
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,190
Waiter

202
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,190
Bring me a bowl of water too.

203
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,710
What kind of water is this?

204
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,310
It's bitter and astringent.

205
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,150
The water from the great river tastes just like this.

206
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,650
If you don't like drinking it,

207
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,580
you don't have to

208
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,800
Ridiculous!

209
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,710
There's no use getting angry.

210
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,320
This is the only kind of water we have here.

211
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,480
However,

212
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,550
the taste of the noodle soup

213
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,910
is a bit better.

214
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,560
That's why

215
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,360
we charge extra for more soup.

216
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:31,910
You

217
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,030
This water tastes so bad,

218
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,960
You actually...

219
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,390
I think it's fine.

220
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,180
Come back.

221
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,430
What are you doing

222
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,950
You have wine but you won't sell it?

223
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,070
This is a jar of aged wine.

224
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,000
Aged wine?

225
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,240
The owner keeps it for himself.

226
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,260
He doesn't allow it to be sold.

227
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,750
Well...

228
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,680
Why were you stealing a sip?

229
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,350
-Uncle Fed.
-Give it to me.

230
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,070
No.

231
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,980
Uncle Fed.

232
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,860
You go back and sit down first.

233
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,620
You go back and sit down first.

234
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,800
Brother

235
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,030
You

236
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,350
What did you call me?

237
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,350
Brother.

238
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,680
Since I walked in just now,

239
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,180
I felt that

240
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,230
you looked just like my brother at home.

241
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,130
Are you serious?

242
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,320
Yingtao.

243
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,070
You're really something.

244
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,530
Waiter.

245
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,710
Clean up the table.

246
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,030
Alright.

247
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,570
Waiter,

248
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,990
what's going on here?

249
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,310
This is the only jar of old wine left in our shop,

250
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,550
and it has already been bought

251
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,480
by these guests.

252
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,990
If you want to drink it,

253
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,070
you'll have to get them to invite you.

254
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,110
Didn't you say there was no more wine?

255
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,040
What, are you going to hit me again?

256
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,350
Good wine!

257
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,050
Gentlemen.

258
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,430
Please take a look at

259
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,150
the horsewhip I'm holding.

260
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,870
If you think it can be considered

261
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,840
a treasure,

262
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,910
then share a bowl of wine with me.

263
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,840
Is that alright?

264
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,720
How can a horsewhip be considered a treasure?

265
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,870
That depends on whose horsewhip it is.

266
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,710
My ancestor

267
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,650
once led 80,000 Northern Army soldiers

268
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,110
in the Battle of Fei River,

269
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,470
and annihilated

270
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,960
Fu Jian's army of 900,000.

271
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,980
This horsewhip

272
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,360
was once held by Fu Jian,

273
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,830
but was eventually confiscated by my ancestor.

274
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,150
Is Fu Jian's horsewhip

275
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,850
considered a treasure?

276
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,050
Are you a descendant of General Xie Xuan?

277
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,620
That's right.

278
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,750
I'm Xie Nianzu from Chen County.

279
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,870
Under the orders of the imperial court,

280
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,190
I am patrolling the Western Regions border

281
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,320
and passing by here.

282
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,950
May I take a look at your horsewhip?

283
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,340
Donghai Yonggu?

284
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,810
Fu Jian's courtesy name was Yonggu,

285
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,030
and he was conferred the title of King of Donghai.

286
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,670
The engraved characters do match up.

287
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,680
Just because the characters match,

288
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,540
doesn't mean it's an artifact from the Six Dynasties.

289
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,600
I don't believe it.

290
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,230
You...

291
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,220
You commoner.

292
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,190
You ordinary civilian.

293
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,580
You've provoked me again and again.

294
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,910
What is your intention?

295
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,410
Recalling the spirit of the Six Dynasties scholars

296
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,710
and the magnanimous air of Jiangzuo,

297
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,090
I will not haggle with you.

298
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,710
I will only drink with you at the same table.

299
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,950
I won't argue.

300
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,660
No arguing.

301
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,750
Oh, enough of that.

302
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,230
I do know about

303
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,750
the aristocratic families living in Wuyi Lane,

304
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,270
like the Wang and Xie clans,

305
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,110
but that was during the Six Dynasties.

306
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,910
Nowadays,

307
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,190
who still recognizes

308
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,090
these former noble families?

309
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,590
That's right.

310
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,990
According to current customs,

311
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,190
my men of the Wuyi lane

312
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,710
are not recognized by the public.

313
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:03,990
But,

314
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,780
people of the four surnames, Cui, Lu, Li, and Zheng,

315
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,100
are mostly mediocre.

316
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,680
They enter officialdom relying on their family status,

317
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,030
get promoted without military achievements,

318
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,430
yet they act arrogantly.

319
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,310
They don't intermarry with other surnames,

320
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,980
and even if they occasionally do,

321
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,540
they often demand a high dowry.

322
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,670
How can these people

323
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,510
be considered worthy

324
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,570
in the eyes of us old nobles of the Wei and Jin dynasties?

325
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,860
You can tolerate this?

326
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,550
An Imperial Censor, right?

327
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,670
This bowl of wine

328
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,360
is dedicated to your ancestor,

329
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,720
Xie Xuan, the Cavalry General Xie.

330
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,180
He made his name in the Battle of Fei River.

331
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,900
He turned the tide when all seemed lost.

332
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,810
Otherwise, we would have

333
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,070
all become slaves of the foreign tribes.

334
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,860
A toast to my ancestor.

335
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:55,990
Thank you.

336
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,750
What you have just said

337
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,710
is not entirely without reason.

338
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,300
But among the four noble clans,

339
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,070
there are also pillars of the state

340
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,730
who step up in times of crisis.

341
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,590
It is perhaps inappropriate for you to

342
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,670
generalize them like this.

343
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,660
That's right.

344
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,950
We have one right here.

345
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,070
Are you from one of these four clans?

346
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,480
You look familiar to me.

347
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,120
We must have met in Chang'an before.

348
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,520
You are indeed mistaken.

349
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,680
This bowl of wine of mine

350
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,690
is dedicated to Xie An, the Grand Tutor Xie.

351
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,800
He not only established immortal achievements

352
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,700
but also maintained the demeanor of a celebrated scholar.

353
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,640
A life as perfect as this,

354
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,110
in the entire history of the nation,

355
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,190
he is the only one.

356
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,990
Yes.

357
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,230
A toast to him.

358
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,030
I dedicate this bowl of wine to the Xie clan of Chen County.

359
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,390
Specifically, a toast to the poetry talent,

360
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,200
Xie Daoyun.

361
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,369
Thinking back to the lady in her prime,

362
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,910
her expression was bright and elegant, graceful and unrestrained.

363
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,099
She truly had the air of the Bamboo Grove.

364
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:11,710
Indeed.

365
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,569
Indeed.

366
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,180
So please, Imperial Censor, on behalf of the lady,

367
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,910
drink everything in this bowl.

368
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,319
Well...

369
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,810
You take pride in your ancestors,

370
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,670
which shows that deep down,

371
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,119
you have a strong sense of honor.

372
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,430
Your journey to the Western Regions

373
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,430
has been arduous.

374
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,710
Your attendant unfortunately lost his life,

375
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,710
yet you have been able to press on without stopping.

376
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,470
I believe once you reach the Western Regions,

377
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,710
you will surely forget your fatigue

378
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,870
and diligently

379
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,830
conduct a thorough investigation

380
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,890
of the local officials and generals.

381
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,920
This will demonstrate the divine prestige

382
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,650
of our Tang Dynasty's Imperial Censors and their discerning eyes.

383
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,300
Who would have thought that here at Qianchong Dock,

384
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,960
I would meet a kindred spirit.

385
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,380
Thank you.

386
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,030
Good wine.

387
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,590
It warms the heart,

388
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,910
not because of the sweetness of this aged brew,

389
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,910
but because of the young lady's well wishes.

390
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,370
Waiter!

391
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,930
I'm here.

392
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,910
I will pay

393
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,970
for all these food and drinks.

394
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,500
That wouldn't be appropriate.

395
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,300
Do you look down on me, my friend?

396
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,360
It's just a few bowls of noodles

397
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,670
and a jar of wine, that's all.

398
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,980
It's not worth much money.

399
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,820
Well...

400
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,000
Although the Wang and Xie clans have declined,

401
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,790
their noble character still remains.

402
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,090
Quite impressive.

403
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,770
You really need not treat us.

404
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,870
Waiter!

405
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,620
Here's your payment.

406
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:57,110
[Qianchong Dock]

407
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,790
Although the official boat has returned,

408
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,720
but it's too late

409
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,740
Why don't we leave tomorrow instead?

410
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,380
That won't do. I have an important mission to do.

411
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,180
I can't delay.

412
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,500
The whirlpool in the middle of the river is treacherous.

413
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:09,910
What if...

414
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,070
Since the day I entered officialdom,

415
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,910
I have been ready to put my life on the line.

416
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,030
You old ferryman, say no more.

417
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,470
Alright then.

418
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,670
If you insist on crossing the river at night

419
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,670
don't blame me if anything happens.

420
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,470
Please

421
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,360
What is this for?

422
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,670
Every day, people who board the boat

423
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,910
need to be registered

424
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,270
and kept on file.

425
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,750
You just need to write down your name,

426
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,880
official position,

427
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,260
and occupation.

428
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,600
So troublesome.

429
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,550
Lift it up, lift it up.

430
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,230
Lift it up, lift it up.

431
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,080
Alright.

432
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,150
Come on.

433
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,910
Put it in the lower cabin.

434
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,670
Ladies and gentlemen.

435
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,560
I’m Wu Ping.

436
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,060
[Wu Ping]

437
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,110
I am in charge of this official boat.

438
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,500
The wind is strong at night.

439
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,430
Please go inside the cabin to rest.

440
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,750
We have prepared clean water on the boat.

441
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,690
Unlike the bitter water at the dock,

442
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,280
it's completely different.

443
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,610
There's water to drink?

444
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,690
There is indeed a flying loft.

445
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,490
What are you going up there for?

446
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,080
The bumps and turbulence

447
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,310
might throw you into the river.

448
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,170
I'm not afraid.

449
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,470
I like the cool breeze.

450
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,790
Besides, I have a lot of things

451
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,920
and I'm afraid of disturbing you distinguished guests.

452
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,570
What a coincidence

453
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,190
I also like the cool breeze.

454
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,870
It's truly a great boat.

455
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,910
It's actually similar to the description in the book

456
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,830
to some extent.

457
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:26,990
Book?

458
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,610
Which book are you talking about?

459
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,390
The moon is bright and stars are few tonight.

460
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,720
The weather is nice too.

461
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,390
Look,

462
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,240
how bright the moon is.

463
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,710
The last time I went there

464
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,740
was five hundred years ago.

465
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,490
Where have you been to?

466
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,110
The moon?

467
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,750
That's all in the past now.

468
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,400
Alright,

469
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,870
tell me,

470
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,290
what exactly is on the moon?

471
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,460
Don't tell me

472
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,220
it's Wu Gang chopping the tree.

473
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,270
The moon

474
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,260
is composed of seven treasures.

475
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,870
Some parts are extremely bright,

476
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,700
that's because the sunlight shines on

477
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,960
the protruding parts.

478
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,510
It's just that the moon also needs maintenance.

479
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,590
At least eighty thousand people work there

480
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,510
every year.

481
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,990
You must be talking nonsense.

482
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,680
Sir, just take it

483
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,210
as if I'm talking nonsense.

484
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,590
Alright, alright.

485
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,700
I'd better go down.

486
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,200
Staying with you

487
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,410
gives me the creeps.

488
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,230
Disembark!

489
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,270
Indeed it's sweet.

490
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,440
Though it's not as good as wine,

491
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,140
But it tastes much better

492
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,620
than the water at the dock.

493
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,510
Everyone,

494
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,830
I am an impatient man.

495
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,750
As soon as I get off the boat, I will buy a horse

496
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,870
and head west overnight.

497
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,350
So I bid you all farewell here.

498
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,110
Young lady, you mentioned

499
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,110
the discerning eyes of our Dynasty's Imperial Censors.

500
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,830
As an Investigating Censor,

501
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,430
I will keep it in mind.

502
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,310
Censor Xie, you're too kind.

503
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,840
What a pity there's no wine.

504
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,050
Bidding farewell with a toast

505
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,200
is the way to go.

506
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,910
Why not let water stand in for wine?

507
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,310
To have met on this great river

508
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,650
is also fate.

509
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,350
Come,

510
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,640
let's drink this cup together.

511
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,270
Well said.

512
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,090
Cheers!

513
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,800
Me too, me too!

514
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,510
Come on!

515
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,350
The whirlpool is approaching soon.

516
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,990
Everyone

517
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,960
please sit tight and hold on.

518
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,590
I want to see what this whirlpool

519
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,940
is really like.

520
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,070
This water...

521
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,950
This water should be harmless.

522
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,880
I have tested it with Yong'an Pill.

523
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,310
What's going on?

524
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,720
How come I am also...

525
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,870
The wine!

526
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,310
Xijun didn't drink the wine.

527
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,510
It should be the wine's problem.

528
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Wine

529
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:46,960
Boat Officer.

530
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,430
that poor guy didn't drink

531
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,870
Trap him in a net.

532
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,550
In a net?

533
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,390
Take that Investigating Censor out.

534
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,700
[Junior Boat Officer]

535
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,300
What are you doing?

536
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,390
Don't worry,

537
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,570
we won't kill you for now.

538
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,710
I like this one.

539
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,830
Beauty.

540
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,700
Let me marry you.

541
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,280
I'll be your big brother for life.

542
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,450
Don't be in a hurry.

543
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,600
You just be honest

544
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,870
and have some sleep.

545
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,990
This sober one

546
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,670
will be yours later

547
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,710
-Thank you, Young Boat Officer.
-Thank you, Young Boat Officer.

548
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,710
Looking at his size,

549
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,150
at most, it can produce 30 to 50 catty of good meat.

550
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,730
It's not even enough for my fish

551
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,100
to have a good meal.

552
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,260
Stop it!

553
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,460
What's going on here?

554
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,320
Impossible!

555
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,660
Such a thing has never happened before.

556
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,730
You used the name of the official ship

557
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,970
to do such things as plotting for money and harming lives.

558
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,100
Plotting for money?

559
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,270
I, Young Master Shao, don't care about money

560
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,070
I must slaughter you all today!

561
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,470
Don't blame me, blame him!

562
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,290
It's his luck that he's the Investigating Censor.

563
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,870
But

564
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,830
But why were you

565
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,100
not knocked out by my drug?

566
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,510
Xijun...

567
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,360
Come.

568
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,950
Sobering Pill?

569
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,190
Save

570
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,380
Lu Lingfeng first...

571
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,550
I, Lu,

572
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,010
am the newly appointed sheriff of Yunding County.

573
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,850
Surrender now, or else.

574
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,640
It seems today

575
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,570
we can only slaughter him to feed the fish first.

576
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,740
He's more sturdy

577
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,630
and can produce a few more catties of good meat.

578
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,860
Kill him!

579
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,710
Still not surrendering?

580
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,370
Surrender?

581
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,480
That word

582
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,310
doesn't exist in my dictionary!

583
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,080
The whirlpool is right ahead!

584
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,150
Just wait for your death!

585
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,100
Let's go!

586
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,470
Sheriff Lu.

587
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,100
Hurry, hurry, and let me out!

588
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,350
Bro.

589
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,820
Where...

590
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,850
Are we?

591
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,890
On the great river.

592
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,110
What happened?

593
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,710
Why am I

594
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,590
in such a disheveled state of dress?

595
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,720
I was the one who helped you put them on.

596
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,190
The official tablet is still here.

597
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,610
Tell me what happened.

598
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,990
How did I fall asleep?

599
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,990
Fall asleep?

600
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,230
Someone drugged you!

601
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,190
Everyone be careful!

602
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,990
The whirlpool!

603
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,350
Chen County. Xie Nianzu.

604
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,880
Investigating Censor.

605
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,770
Patrolling the Western Regions.

606
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,210
Jade Emperor. Returning to the Heavenly Palace.

607
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,320
Why is there another...

608
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:48,970
Father!

609
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,260
Son,

610
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,600
what's going on?

611
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,110
A lone boat sails at night, with strong winds and high waves,

612
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,030
and encounters a whirlpool in the middle of the river.

613
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,570
The mortal world is more treacherous

614
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,030
than the Heavenly Palace.

615
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,950
What are you talking about?

616
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,800
The boatmen have all fled.

617
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,070
At this rate

618
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm afraid we'll be buried in this great river!

619
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,100
Tie it up!

620
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,260
You've got some skills!

621
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,040
I used to be a fisherman.

622
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,440
If you all trust me,

623
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,820
follow me to the bottom cabin and row with all your might.

624
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,390
We will surely escape danger!

625
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:21,920
Alright!

626
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,550
All back?

627
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,030
Yes

628
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,020
Father, all here.

629
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,400
Then what's there to be afraid of?

630
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,110
Even if the whirlpool

631
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,640
doesn't get them, they will

632
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,250
become fish food anyway.

633
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,310
Father,

634
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,230
they have some skills.

635
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,150
My drug

636
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,790
failed to knock them out.

637
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,790
In this vast world,

638
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,200
there are quite a few people with some skills.

639
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,590
However,

640
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,070
they all have to die eventually.

641
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,420
When the wind and waves calm down,

642
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,240
we'll find their boat

643
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,700
we'll find a boat and leave

644
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,790
By the way.

645
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,950
There's a madman on that boat

646
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,350
who calls himself the Jade Emperor.

647
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,920
[Jade Emperor. Returns to Heaven]

648
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,520
Brother.

649
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,060
You are still seriously injured.

650
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,750
Why don't you take a rest first?

651
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,340
My wound hurts.

652
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,270
Yingtao,

653
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,150
you have just recovered from your injury too.

654
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,810
Take a break if you can't go on.

655
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,220
I have a thick skin,

656
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,160
I'm fine

657
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,190
Su Wuming.

658
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,420
Don't push yourself.

659
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,470
Go and have a rest.

660
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,320
The boat seems to have stabilized.

661
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,670
Have we

662
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,929
already sailed away from the whirlpool?

663
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,110
The direction is just right now.

664
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,150
The long journey

665
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,190
has already begun.

666
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,030
A long journey?

667
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,910
Since we have already sailed away from the whirlpool,

668
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,830
reaching the opposite shore

669
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,230
shouldn't take more than two hours, right?

670
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,110
What are you still standing here for?

671
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,020
Hurry up and go

672
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,230
adjust the direction of the sail

673
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,980
and get to shore quickly.

674
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,430
I still have a long way to go.

675
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,360
What's the rush?

676
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,910
You and I

677
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,990
were not acquainted before,

678
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,320
but now we are crossing the river together on the same boat,

679
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,180
this scene

680
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,820
feels more and more familiar to me.

681
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,930
Don't you think it's strange

682
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,340
To ask such a question,

683
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,190
how ignorant.

684
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,670
My name is Yu Di.

685
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,470
Yu as in 'depressed',

686
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,160
Di as in 'younger brother'.

687
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,280
I go by this name

688
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,470
just to keep a low profile.

689
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,210
In my previous life,

690
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,830
I was the Jade Emperor,

691
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,430
the ruler of Heaven!

692
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,510
Oh no

693
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,400
He's gone mad, totally mad.

694
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,870
When he first boarded the ship,

695
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,000
he claimed that he had been to the moon.

696
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,040
That year

697
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,360
a white sparrow went missing from Heaven.

698
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,010
It was a divine bird

699
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,120
and an auspicious omen.

700
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,590
Whoever possessed it could accomplish great things.

701
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,590
I ordered a thorough investigation

702
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,910
only to find out that the white sparrow had descended to the mortal world

703
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,910
and had fallen into the hands of Zhang Jian, a commoner from Yuyang.

704
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,570
So I rode my dragon chariot down to the mortal world

705
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,230
to capture the white sparrow.

706
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,630
But unexpectedly, Zhang Jian was full of tricks.

707
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,280
He pretended to be a warm and hospitable host.

708
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,350
Together with the white sparrow, they got me drunk.

709
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,610
They stole my dragon chariot

710
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,070
and flew straight up to Heaven.

711
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,190
He impersonated me

712
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,340
and replaced all the celestial officials.

713
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,620
From then on, that Zhang Jian

714
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,900
became the new Jade Emperor

715
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,590
while I

716
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,650
could only wander the mortal world.

717
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,860
Yu Di,

718
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,550
you...

719
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,470
Well...

720
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,380
He got us out of this predicament.

721
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,970
He couldn't be a madman, could he?

722
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,990
Listen,

723
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,110
Yu Di.

724
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,510
From what you've said,

725
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,430
that white sparrow

726
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,360
seems quite suspicious.

727
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,470
You think so too

728
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,450
The story you just told

729
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,460
has two loopholes.

730
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,990
Firstly,

731
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,240
you lost your dragon chariot

732
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,160
and couldn't return to Heaven.

733
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,930
This shows that you, as the Jade Emperor,

734
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,520
don't have much power.

735
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,830
Secondly,

736
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,500
after Zhang Jian ascended to Heaven,

737
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,600
he easily replaced all the celestial officials.

738
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,330
That suggests the officials

739
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,390
had never seen your true face as the Jade Emperor.

740
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,510
Exactly.

741
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,120
These two loopholes

742
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,430
how do you explain them

743
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,670
Those are all matters of the past.

744
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,730
How could I remember them so clearly?

745
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,390
Stop talking nonsense

746
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,750
Hurry up and think of a way

747
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,090
to get the boat to the other shore as soon as possible,

748
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,650
okay?

749
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,310
You hot-tempered

750
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,600
Investigating Censor

751
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,940
should lose consciousness soon.

752
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,630
I

753
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,670
You guys, too.

754
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,620
This big boat

755
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,160
is finally mine!

756
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,310
I shall ride this boat

757
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,000
and sail downstream

758
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,910
straight into the sea.

759
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,710
Hoist the sails and voyage far

760
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,670
to reach the Heavenly River!

761
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,460
The Milky Way

762
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,730
is connected with the sea.

763
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,020
In recent times, a person was living on a sea islet.

764
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,680
Every August, a floating raft would come and go,

765
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,510
never missing its schedule.

766
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,790
That ambitious person

767
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,190
built a flying loft on the raft.

768
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,700
He brought ample provisions

769
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,030
and set off on the raft.

770
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,310
This is an excerpt from Zhang Hua's

771
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,480
Encyclopedia during the Six Dynasties

772
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,640
It seems you are

773
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,390
also very familiar

774
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,100
with this book.

775
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,030
You

776
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,630
If we weren't pretending

777
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,490
to be knocked out by your incense,

778
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,810
we wouldn't have known

779
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,200
that you were delusionally trying to seize the boat

780
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,930
and sail to the Heavenly River.

781
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,740
You lunatic!

782
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,750
But the incense I used

783
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,280
was taught by my old master.

784
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,320
It's very effective!

785
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,650
That old master of yours

786
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,890
must also be a lunatic

787
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,620
cultivating in the mountains.

788
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,600
Compared to me, this old miracle doctor,

789
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,770
how can he compare?

790
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,800
I used to be a fisherman.

791
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,160
If you all trust me,

792
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,780
follow me to the bottom cabin and row with all your might.

793
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,260
We will surely escape danger!

794
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,870
Alright!

795
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,530
Censor, wait a moment.

796
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,690
This person is somewhat strange.

797
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,320
We must be on guard.

798
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,280
I implore you.

799
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,010
Please help me, Su Wuming,

800
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,430
get to the bottom of this.

801
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,610
You are Su Wuming?

802
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,650
He is Lu Lingfeng?

803
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,830
No wonder when I first met you,

804
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,070
I felt you two looked familiar.

805
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,500
When I was at Sky-scraping Tower,

806
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,480
I saw you two before.

807
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,630
I was standing far away at that time.

808
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,190
Enough!

809
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,470
Stop with the pleasantries!

810
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,190
Okay!

811
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,700
I'll follow your lead.

812
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,010
Fed!

813
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,320
Got it!

814
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,360
You were using knock-out powder, weren't you?

815
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,230
Let me tell you.

816
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,610
I have been hanging around Chang'an Ghost Market

817
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,110
for several decades.

818
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,820
If I didn't have some

819
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,550
ways to counter the drug,

820
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,980
how could I have survived till today?

821
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,520
You led us out of the whirlpool

822
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,900
and saved our lives.

823
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,760
I was originally grateful to you.

824
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,350
But you

825
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,260
You've gone astray.

826
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,090
Do you really think

827
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,830
you can sail the boat into the sea

828
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,090
and go straight into the Heavenly River?

829
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,650
That is my wish.

830
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,470
But the matter of returning to Heaven

831
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,530
has been ruined by you all.

832
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,390
It is indeed recorded in the Encyclopedia

833
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,050
that the sea is connected to the Heavenly River.

834
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,820
But that's just a book of strange tales.

835
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,270
What's recorded is nothing but

836
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,590
myths and legends.

837
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,510
What

838
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,630
You actually believe it?

839
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,250
Of course, it's true!

840
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,720
You haven't tested it,

841
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,310
how do you know it's fake?

842
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,010
Then let me ask you.

843
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,440
Why do you have to board the boat

844
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,390
at Qianchong Dock?

845
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,810
Qianchong Dock?

846
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,230
That name was only changed in the Sui Dynasty.

847
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,710
This dock was originally called the Immortal Dock.

848
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,990
The book says if you want to go out to the sea and straight to the Heavenly River,

849
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,940
you must board the boat here!

850
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,580
Well then,

851
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,590
the books you've read

852
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,410
are even more diverse than mine.

853
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,620
It's just that

854
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,690
How did you know I wanted to seize the boat?

855
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,600
That bloodletting technique of yours

856
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,070
is obviously a wicked art.

857
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,740
But those flat pancakes

858
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,140
were indeed good stuff.

859
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,070
They can last a hundred days without spoiling.

860
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,350
But on this journey,

861
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,950
there are both official stage stations

862
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,390
and private inns.

863
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,870
Why does a traveler like you

864
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,790
need to buy so many flat pancakes?

865
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,470
I have to admit

866
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,800
you do have some skills.

867
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,590
The dock is at least more than 7 miles

868
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,580
away from where we met.

869
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,350
We were on horseback while you ran,

870
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,790
yet you arrived first

871
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,560
and even pre-ordered the flat pancakes

872
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,910
and finished a bowl of soup noodles.

873
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,570
You ran really fast.

874
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,900
What gave you away in the end

875
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,310
was actually

876
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,950
what you said when you boarded the boat.

877
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,410
There is indeed a flying loft.

878
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,500
He built a flying loft on the raft

879
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,590
and brought plenty of food.

880
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,110
This boat happens to have a loft.

881
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,260
You thought

882
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:57,080
it was the will of Heaven helping you seize the ship and sail out to sea.

883
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,740
I don't believe in this legend

884
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,720
but the story of sailing a boat into the clouds

885
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,350
is bizarre and beautiful.

886
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,300
Yes

887
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,430
It's very beautiful.

888
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:11,630
What a pity

889
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,630
that you guys messed it up.

890
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,880
I didn't want to kill anyone originally.

891
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,070
But I won't let my attempt to return to the Heavenly Palace

892
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,190
be in vain!

893
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,240
Mortals who stand in the Jade Emperor's way

894
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,090
must die!
