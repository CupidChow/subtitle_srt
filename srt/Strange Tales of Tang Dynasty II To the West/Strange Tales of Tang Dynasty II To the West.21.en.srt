We can't keep waiting like this.

Fed.

6
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,470
You stay and wait for Lu Lingfeng.

Yingtao.

8
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,310
You go on the streets

9
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,770
to make inquiries

10
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,480
about Taiyin Sect.

11
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,030
Xijun.

12
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,770
You and I will go meet the prefectural governor of Hanzhou,

13
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,350
Liao Xin.

[Prefectural Governor's Residence]

15
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,710
The prefectural governor is busy.

16
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,310
He doesn't have time for you.

17
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,470
My father is Pei Jian,

18
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,710
the former Assistant Minister of Personnel.

19
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,390
Did you tell that to Governor Liao?

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,990
I did.

21
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,910
Go back.

22
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,590
Wait a moment.

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,670
Now what?

24
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,230
The tongue relic of Master Moshi

25
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,670
is the treasure of Hanzhou

26
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,520
and the ultimate treasure of the world.

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,230
Unfortunately, Hui'an Temple in Hanzhou

28
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,310
only has half of it.

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,890
The other half…

30
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,170
Let them in.

31
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,700
Quick.

32
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,750
Wait.

33
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,400
I'll personally welcome them.

34
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,590
Mr. Su.

35
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,820

I'm Su Wuming, from Wugong County.

00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,370
I'm Pei Xijun, from Chang'an.

39
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,870
-Greetings, Governor Liao.
-Greetings, Governor Liao.

40
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,210
Please come in.

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,490
This Investigating Censor

42
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,880
thought so highly of himself.

43
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,930
I can't say

44
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,390
he had no right to do this,

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,630
but…

46
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,190
but it doesn't matter now.

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,190
Tell me about Master Moshi.

48
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,470
Master Moshi once translated sutras in Vajra Temple

49
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,710
between Chang'an and Hanzhou.

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,750
When he was there,

51
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,630
he turned a robber into a Buddha.

52
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,230
Yes.

53
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,020
I've heard of that story.

54
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,690
We started our journey in Chang'an

55
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,270
and headed all the way west.

56
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,190
When we passed Shen County,

57
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,670
we stumbled upon

58
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,150
the site of the Vajra Temple.

59
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,750
Really?

60
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,590
We discovered

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,790
half of Master Moshi's tongue relic there,

62
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,910
or I wouldn't have been sure

63
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,310
that it was Vajra Temple.

64
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,700
When Master Moshi passed away,

65
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,870
his tongue turned into a relic.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,800
It's said that

67
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,490
half of it was left in Hanzhou

68
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,030
and the other half was sent to Vajra Temple.

69
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,290
It turns out to be true.

70
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,390
You have the relic on you?

71
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,890
Take it out now. I want to pay my respects.

72
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,230
There are five of us.

73
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,110
We were attacked in Vajra Temple

74
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,880
and went through a lot

75
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,710
before finally bringing the tongue relic

76
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,870
to Hanzhou.

77
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,720
It's just that

78
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,140
the two of us don't have it.

79
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,470
Then who has it?

80
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,980
Get them here now.

81
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,490
Lu Lingfeng

82
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,240
has the relic.

83
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,909
The guy mentioned here,

84
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,200
the new sheriff of Yunding County?

85
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,670
Yes.

86
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,040
Since he's in Hanzhou,

87
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,200
why didn't he come to visit me?

88
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,659
Lu Lingfeng

89
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,030
has fallen into

90
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,510
the hands of Taiyin Sect.

91
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,190
If you want the tongue relic,

92
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,070
you must send people to save him.

93
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,070
Why is

94
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,800
Taiyin Sect involved in it?

95
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,750
Guards.

96
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,970
Get Tian Chou and Ma Meng here.

97
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,620
If my memory serves me right,

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,440
we've met before.

99
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,550
I indeed had the honor

100
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,750
of meeting you once.

101
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,030
That big guy

102
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,100
is Lu Lingfeng?

103
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,690
Since he's the new sheriff of Yunding County,

104
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,550
why didn't he tell me at that time?

105
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,080
Stop asking questions.

106
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,710
What they said happened

107
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,230
in the smithy last night,

108
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,990
is it true?

109
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,110
Yes.

110
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,990
Lu Lingfeng has probably

111
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,790
been set up by Taiyin Sect.

112
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,300
Find a way to save him!

113
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,070
I, Ma Meng, request permission

114
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,870
to eliminate Taiyin Sect again.

115
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,470
To eliminate them, you need troops.

116
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,710
If you bring the troops away,

117
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,910
who will guard Hui'an Temple?

118
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,710
Who will guard Hanzhou Granary?

119
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,510
Mount Taiyin

120
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,030
is indeed the lair of the rebels.

121
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,710
But Lu Lingfeng disappeared

122
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,450
in Hanzhou.

123
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,890
Find him first.

124
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,670
Remember.

125
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,950
He has

126
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,690
half of Master Moshi's tongue relic.

127
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,970
You must bring it back.

128
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,580
If it can be put back together with the other half

129
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,620
in Hui'an Temple,

130
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,960
that will be

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,740
a great blessing for Hanzhou.

132
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,510
Yes.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,180
Ma Meng had a point.

134
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,100
If Lu Lingfeng

135
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,380
has already been taken into the mountain,

136
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,330
then we…

137
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,560
We must not let the tongue relic

138
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,090
fall into the hands of Taiyin rebels.

139
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,140
Administrator Tian.

140
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,909
Go to the Commander's Mansion to borrow troops.

141
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,570
Tell Mr. Lu I've made up my mind

142
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,560
to eliminate Taiyin Sect.

143
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,170
Yes, sir.

144
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,590
Did Administrator Tian

145
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,370
ever have a beard?

146
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,480
Beard?

147
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,270
Why?

148
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,610
An old friend of mine

149
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,330
looks very similar to Administrator Tian.

150
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,260
But my friend

151
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,150
has a beard.

152
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,870
Lu Lingfeng has actually

153
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,230
fooled Major Linghu

154
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,960
and made me keep watch for him.

155
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,150
Later, after he gets drunk,

156
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,150
I'll butcher him!

157
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,390
One word.

158
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,940
Patience.

159
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,340
I thought I needed to meet

160
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,140
the sect leader in Mount Taiyin.

161
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,170
I didn't expect

162
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
to see him in a restaurant downtown.

163
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,630
No rush.

164
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,260
I can't let you meet him

165
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,409
on an empty stomach.

166
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,070
Yeah.

167
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,630
I do feel hungry.

168
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,870
Sorry for what happened earlier.

169
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,910
Here's to you,

170
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,390
Mr. Lu.

171
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,670
Since Duan Gui took control of Hanzhou,

172
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,480
it's been nearly 100 years.

173
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,830
The fact that you've made it to this day

174
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,950
truly commands respect.

175
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,190
Is it true that you already heard

176
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,190
about Taiyin Sect back in Chang'an?

177
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,470
Yes!

178
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,830
That's why I can't wait

179
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,670
to meet your sect leader.

180
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,420
After we finish the meal,

181
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll take you to him.

182
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,910
Somehow,

183
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,830
I hit it off with you.

184
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,390
You fight well

185
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,690
and are very brave.

186
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,070
I really admire you.

187
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,750
I admire you more.

188
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,070
No matter how well I fight and how brave I am,

189
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,590
I've still been defeated by you.

190
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,030
Here.

191
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,270
To you.

192
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:58,990
Sir.

193
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,390
We found Lu Lingfeng.

194
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,530
Where is he?

195
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,970
He's dining at Jinsha Restaurant

196
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,590
with several guards who appear

197
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,720
to be Taiyin rebels.

198
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,620
So this is how he disappeared.

199
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,030
Gather the men.

200
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,540
Yes.

201
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,040
On the second floor.

202
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,480
Lu Lingfeng!

203
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,590
You've actually colluded with Taiyin rebels.

204
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,050
Are you planning to rebel?

205
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,990
You became

206
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,230
the judicial adjutant

207
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,790
at such a young age.

208
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,390
I made so many achievements

209
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,750
yet was demoted for no reason.

210
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,750
Why can't I rebel?

211
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,520
You admit it?

212
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,320
Mr. Lu.

213
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,910
Where are you going?

214
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,400
Your men downstairs

215
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,430
are under attack.

216
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,530
Let's go save them.

217
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,470
No need.

218
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,390
That captain outside

219
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,730
is called Luo Qian.

220
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,420
He stops at nothing to climb up the ladder.

221
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,430
He even framed me.

222
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,190
He can use a hard lesson.

223
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,390
Let's go.

224
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,190
Is he okay?

225
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:54,840
Look.

226
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,320
Lieutenant.

227
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,870
Wu Ping and three of my men

228
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,860
were killed.

229
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,790
I suspect…

230
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,510
No.

231
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,510
Not suspect.

232
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,270
I'm sure

233
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,240
Linghu Shuo is in cahoots

234
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,360
with the Hanzhou government through Lu Lingfeng.

235
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,230
Otherwise, how could Ma Meng show up

236
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,040
right after we arrived

237
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,430
at Jinsha Restaurant?

238
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,470
Besides, he and Lu Lingfeng

239
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,550
left without a scratch!

240
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,950
Linghu Shuo betrayed the sect leader?

241
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,070
Yes!

242
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,980
Where are they?

243
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,740
I don't know.

244
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,320
I guess Linghu Shuo

245
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,610
will take Lu Lingfeng into the mountain.

246
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,710
Lieutenant Yuan.

247
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,950
At this point,

248
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,900
we have to take precautions.

249
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,870
[Lieutenant Yuan of Taiyin Sect]

250
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,670
It's said that

251
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,990
the Huns

252
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,140
used animal bones to make arrowheads.

253
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,200
They could pierce through throats

254
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,800
and were sharper than metal.

255
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,830
This time, the sect leader thought of

256
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,910
[Master Wu Liang, the chief commander of Taiyin Sect]

257
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,910
using animal bones to make arrows.

258
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,150
What a brilliant idea.

259
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,550
The sect leader is full of brilliant ideas.

260
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,080
He's also wise and valiant.

261
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,420
With these arrows,

262
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,830
we can definitely get what we want.

263
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,050
But recently,

264
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,310
Linghu Shuo has been suspicious.

265
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,550
I suspect

266
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,750
he's betrayed the sect leader.

267
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,430
Who got us all these animal bones?

268
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,430
These bones

269
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,950
can be made into 100,000 arrows.

270
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,990
If Linghu Shuo is disloyal,

271
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,870
tell me who's loyal.

272
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,550
I know

273
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,460
you think highly of Linghu Shuo.

274
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,630
It's just that

275
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,670
ever since Lu Lingfeng arrived in Hanzhou,

276
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,910
everything he did

277
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,140
has been suspicious.

278
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,430
Like this time,

279
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,670
he wants to bring Lu Lingfeng

280
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,390
into the mountain to meet the sect leader.

281
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:09,870
It's…

282
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,790
I've been working hard

283
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,570
for Taiyin Sect for 30 years

284
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,440
yet still haven't met the leader.

285
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,480
We don't know if Lu can be trusted.

286
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,690
If…

287
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,210
If the sect leader is in danger,

288
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,470
Taiyin Sect will be in danger.

289
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,070
Indeed.

290
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,200
Yuan He,

291
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,080
you've worked with me for 30 years.

292
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,900
Back then, you couldn't find the sect leader

293
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,790
and had to become a monk

294
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,250
to escape death.

295
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,790
You've been through a lot.

296
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,710
But the river

297
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,400
never stops flowing forward.

298
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,120
Are you worried that Linghu Shuo will make his mark

299
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,790
and outrank you?

300
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,390
How…

301
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,670
How could you say that?

302
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,910
I'm a lieutenant

303
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,480
and also your direct disciple.

304
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,380
Don't you know me?

305
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,020
Everything I do is for Taiyin Sect,

306
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,310
not for myself.

307
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,840
That's good.

308
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,630
How's the production of arrows

309
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,160
going in Jiufang Pavilion?

310
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,980
50,000 arrows have been made.

311
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,570
Great.

312
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,510
Tell them to speed up.

313
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,830
We'll rise up soon.

314
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,640
No delay is allowed.

315
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,110
We have enough arrows now,

316
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,030
but weapons like Heng swords and long spears

317
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,630
are woefully inadequate.

318
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,600
Don't worry.

319
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,980
Tang's army has them.

320
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,320
Once we seize Hanzhou City,

321
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,230
we'll get our weapons.

322
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,150
What worries me the most now

323
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,830
is whether it's safe

324
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,030
for the sect leader to meet Lu Lingfeng.

325
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,700
Be careful.

326
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,540
What the heck?

327
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,790
Riding so fast.

328
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,480
By the end of this month,

329
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,040
[Hanzhou]

330
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,910
the flag on the gate of Hanzhou City

331
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,240
will have been changed.

332
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,870
Linghu, you sound so confident.

333
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,910
Don't forget

334
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,910
Hanzhou is heavily guarded.

335
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,030
Are you doubting us?

336
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,450
To be honest,

337
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,470
in the counties and villages

338
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,750
around Hanzhou City,

339
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,310
there are countless members of Taiyin Sect.

340
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,510
When called upon,

341
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,990
they can form an army of 100,000.

342
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,710
But the new emperor has issued the Iron Restriction Order,

343
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,890
aiming to create a safe country

344
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,850
where one can

345
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,330
travel miles without carrying any weapons.

346
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,270
Aren't you also looking for blacksmiths

347
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,200
to forge swords?

348
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,850
You have an army of 100,000,

349
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,280
but what about the weapons?

350
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,880
Especially the arrows.

351
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,330
How can you get them?

352
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,190
Don't worry about that, Lu.

353
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,230
Everything

354
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,230
is under the control of the sect leader.

355
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,109
Let's go.

356
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,750
If we speed up,

357
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,119
we can enter the mountain in two hours.

358
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,490
What's that sound?

359
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,579
Mount Taiyin expands

360
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,750
for 300 miles.

361
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,270
All kinds of rare birds and beasts live here.

362
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,730
Horses get scared easily.

363
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,710
Don't worry about the horses.

364
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,440
Someone will take care of them.

365
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,870
How much further?

366
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,080
It's hard to say.

367
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,950
You still don't trust me?

368
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,390
I do.

369
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,400
It's true that I didn't trust you before,

370
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,580
but when you

371
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,710
kicked Ma Meng out of the window,

372
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,190
you won my complete trust.

373
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,470
By "It's hard to say,"

374
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,950
I mean the trip up the mountain

375
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,550
is hard beyond description.

376
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,790
You know…

377
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,330
the imperial army entered the mountain many times,

378
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,500
but they never found

379
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,960
the stronghold of Taiyin.

380
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,920
Let's go.

381
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,480
There's really another world

382
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
in Mount Taiyin.

383
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,930
-Greetings, Major Linghu.
-Greetings, Major Linghu.

384
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,200
Every dynasty has

385
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,030
its own color.

386
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,660
For example, the Qin dynasty

387
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,190
was associated with Water,

388
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,710
so black was favored.

389
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,030
The former Sui Dynasty

390
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,210
was associated with Fire,

391
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,660
so red was favored.

392
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,070
And because Fire generates Earth,

393
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,000
the Tang dynasty

394
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,120
favors yellow.

395
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,340
Why does Taiyin Sect

396
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,590
have flags

397
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,190
of all colors?

398
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,690
Based on the Theory of Five Elements, a dynasty

399
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,070
can choose only one color.

400
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,670
But we believe that

401
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,920
the five elements should fill

402
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,190
the universe to achieve grand unification.

403
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,790
And,

404
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,450
most importantly,

405
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,010
the flags of different colors

406
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,210
represent different

407
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,090
troop numbers.

408
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,760
In the order of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth,

409
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,920
troops of the corresponding color

410
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,050
decrease in number.

411
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,950
The flag of Metal

412
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,850
represents 1,000 men at most.

413
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,430
The leader of Taiyin Sect

414
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,590
is such a genius.

415
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
But I know that

416
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,720
the Sect was greatly weakened before,

417
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,640
completely annihilated by the court of Tang.

418
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,910
When did you regroup and rise again?

419
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,280
Three years ago.

420
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,110
Three years ago?

421
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,850
Such achievements in just three years.

422
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,990
Your sect leader is extraordinary.

423
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,510
He must be a respectful old man

424
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,080
who's a master of strategy.

425
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,590
You may not believe it,

426
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,980
but I've never met

427
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,230
the sect leader in person.

428
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,630
In Taiyin Sect,

429
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
only the chief commander

430
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,490
can see the sect leader.

431
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,670
Does that mean

432
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,940
you haven't gained

433
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,950
the trust of the sect leader?

434
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,080
That's not the case.

435
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,550
Every room and house here

436
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,080
were built under my supervision,

437
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,870
including the sect leader's residence.

438
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,730
I know every

439
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,070
secret room, mechanism,

440
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,830
and even escape route

441
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,520
like the back of my hand.

442
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,160
I can't see the sect leader

443
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,890
simply because

444
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,410
my rank is too low.

445
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,990
But I can wait.

446
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,460
With achievements,

447
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,490
I can be promoted.

448
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,030
I look forward to becoming

449
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,230
the chief commander.

450
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Then I can stay

451
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,380
with the sect leader day and night.

452
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,490
No matter what,

453
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,720
having the ability to rally

454
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,640
so many followers in the mountain,

455
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,710
your sect leader

456
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,420
is really extraordinary.

457
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,690
I truly admire him.

458
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,750
Let's go.

459
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,850
[Taiyin]

460
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,110
[Taiyin]

461
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,760
[Moonlight]

462
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,950
By the way,

463
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,970
after we get in,

464
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,390
you can take a rest first.

465
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,750
I'm not tired.

466
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
I can't wait to meet the sect leader.

467
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,270
Be patient.

468
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,750
You can only meet

469
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,470
the sect leader after the moon

470
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,190
comes out.

471
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,650
I see.

472
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,670
General Lu.

473
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,420
Please.

474
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,800
Aren't you coming with me?

475
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,350
I'm too low-ranking to meet the leader.

476
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,470
He trusts you so much, General Lu.

477
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,270
I'm very envious.

478
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,590
Please don't let him down.

479
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,520
I'm Lu Lingfeng. Greetings, Sect Leader.

480
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,530
You're from the Lu family of Fanyang?

481
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,550
Yes.

482
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,640
Former General of the Imperial Guards

483
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,510
and Deputy President of the Supreme Court?

484
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,510
Yes.

485
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,560
Young as you are,

486
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,710
you've made it to such a high position

487
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,110
in the court of Tang.

488
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,350
You must be very capable.

489
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,610
I had success at a young age,

490
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,590
but my career hasn't been all smooth.

491
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,520
I feel lucky

492
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,390
to have the chance

493
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,710
to talk to Taiyin Sect's leader

494
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,530
about our common goal of seizing the throne.

495
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,330
Well, then,

496
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,950
draw the deployment map.

497
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,630
How can you prove

498
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,940
you're really

499
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,010
the leader of Taiyin Sect?

500
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,310
What kind of beast is that?

501
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,040
How dare you!

502
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,640
It's the Mountain God,

503
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,410
a Tongtian rhino.

504
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,390
Just a rhino.

505
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,370
Why is it the Mountain God?

506
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,790
The Mountain God was originally

507
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,630
an ordinary saw-toothed rhino.

508
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,210
But over the past hundred years,

509
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,460
it's absorbed the essence of moonlight

510
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,420
and gradually grown extremely tall and big.

511
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,110
It's the head of all animals

512
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,770
in the 300-mile Mount Taiyin.

513
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,340
That's why it's called the Mountain God.

514
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,390
If I were not the sect leader,

515
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,750
how could I command the Mountain God?

516
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,150
Can you

517
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,630
draw the deployment map now?

518
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,630
What?

519
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,030
You can't draw it?

520
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,040
Lu Lingfeng.

521
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,360
I knew you had ulterior motives.

522
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,900
Guards!

523
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,790
Wait.

524
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,950
Who are you?

525
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,070
How dare you!

526
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,810
How dare you, a major,

527
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,650
barge into my hall?

528
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,680
You're not the sect leader.

529
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,130
Where is the chief commander?

530
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,090
I want to see the chief commander.

531
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,880
Why would he see you?

532
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,470
The chief commander doesn't believe

533
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,130
Lu Lingfeng has sided with us,

534
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,090
so he's ordered me to test him.

535
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,170
Unexpectedly,

536
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,110
I found out that

537
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,200
you, Linghu Shuo, have ulterior motives too.

538
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,960
Yuan He?

539
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,280
How dare you pretend to be the sect leader?

540
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,010
Take him down.

541
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,990
Luo Qian?

542
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,440
Linghu Shuo,

543
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,870
you've always been bossy just because

544
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,670
the chief commander trusts you.

545
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,670
Today,

546
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,450
you have to get off your high horse.

547
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,400
How dare you?

548
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,610
How dare you betray the sect leader?

549
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,750
Since you're not the sect leader,

550
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,080
I won't waste my breath.

551
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,100
Major Linghu,

552
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,720
don't try to save me.

553
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,430
If I die, so be it.

554
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,070
Take good care of yourself.

555
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,400
Don't let them hurt you.

556
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,700
He asked you to take good care of yourself.

557
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,300
He's worried we may hurt you.

558
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,310
You and Lu Lingfeng

559
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,510
have long been in cahoots.

560
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,130
It's not like that.

561
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,640
Linghu,

562
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,860
I didn't see it coming.

563
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,350
Sorry for getting you involved.

564
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,270
Linghu Shuo.

565
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,410
You betrayed the sect leader!

566
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,010
You've been deceived by Lu Lingfeng.

567
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,030
What an idiot!

568
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,250
You brought this upon yourself.

569
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,930
Lu.

570
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,170
You set me up?

571
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,430
What do you mean?

572
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,240
You and I

573
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,870
are already in the same boat.

574
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,120
Fortunately, the sect leader is a visionary.

575
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,140
Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

576
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
Linghu Shuo,

577
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,230
enjoy being food

578
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,960
with Lu Lingfeng.

579
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,150
Yuan He.

580
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,290
You have no right to do this!

581
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,010
You have no right to do this!

582
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,380
I want to see the sect leader

583
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,610
and the chief commander!

584
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,810
The chief commander will clear my name!

585
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,370
Stop shouting.

586
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,160
No one

587
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,560
will come to your rescue.

588
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,150
Lu Lingfeng.

589
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,270
I didn't expect you to be my death.

590
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,070
You're not dead yet.

591
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,550
That imposter talked about

592
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,670
food just now.

593
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,840
This is not a kitchen.

594
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,880
How can we get any food here?

595
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,870
He meant that

596
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,510
you and I would become food.

597
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,360
Now you understand.

598
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,990
This place is called the Delicacy Cave.

599
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,360
It's where Taiyin Sect

600
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,880
kills prisoners.

601
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,580
Those thrown down here

602
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,120
will become delicacies for the Mountain God.

603
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,390
Wait a minute.

604
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,950
Isn't the Mountain God a Tongtian rhino?

605
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,270
Why is it a tiger?

606
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,390
As food for the Mountain God,

607
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,570
we're too small.

608
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,390
After this tiger eats us,

609
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,000
it'll become food

610
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,370
for the Tongtian rhino.

611
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,150
No wonder it's grown huge.

612
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,070
It feeds on tigers.

613
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,310
Help me!

614
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,240
Your left hook is powerful.

615
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,120
I once fought a tiger.

616
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,880
It was just an illusion.

617
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,710
But the one today

618
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,010
is a real tiger.

619
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,370
If you hadn't knocked it over,

620
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,310
I would've died.

621
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,940
You fought well too.

622
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,330
If you hadn't weakened it,

623
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
no matter how powerful my hooks are,

624
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,710
I couldn't have killed it.

625
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,210
Linghu.

626
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,630
You saved my life.

627
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,590
Thank you.

628
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,430
You framed me on purpose

629
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,590
just to make them

630
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,630
throw me down here

631
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,950
because I told you

632
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,670
every mechanism

633
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,960
and escape route here

634
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,670
was built under my supervision.

635
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,600
Yes.

636
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,880
If I hadn't gotten you down,

637
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,400
I would've died.

638
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,420
I played dirty

639
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,650
just to survive.

640
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,770
Please forgive me, Linghu.

641
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,350
I thought I was very smart,

642
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,430
but you're actually even more…

643
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,850
cunning than me.

644
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,110
Cunning?

645
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,200
It's the first time

646
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,950
someone has called me that.

647
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,550
But you guessed right.

648
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,710
When I built

649
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,310
the Delicacy Cave back then,

650
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,950
I did build a secret escape tunnel.

651
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,830
This seat

652
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,440
is so comfortable.

653
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,370
Congratulations, Lieutenant Yuan.

654
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,340
May you soon become the leader

655
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,840
of Taiyin Sect.

656
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,400
What are you talking about?

657
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,260
I'm just a lieutenant.

658
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,150
Now, except for Linghu Shuo,

659
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,310
no one can be your rival

660
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,830
in Taiyin Sect.

661
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,040
I heard the chief commander

662
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,350
is over 100 years old.

663
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,850
His days are numbered.

664
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,270
After he dies,

665
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,480
you'll be the chief commander,

666
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,850
the second most powerful man

667
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,760
in Taiyin Sect.

668
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,070
Only the chief commander can meet the sect leader.

669
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,440
By then,

670
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,670
if you want to sit on this chair forever,

671
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,739
just give me the word.

672
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,270
That mysterious sect leader will be…

673
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,100
The walls have ears.

674
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,120
Don't worry.

675
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,830
Everyone outside listens to me.

676
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,989
It's too soon to consider that.

677
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,550
We need to topple the government first.

678
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,470
By the way,

679
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,820
have you sent gold coins

680
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,750
to Commander Lu?

681
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,820
Today is the day to send him gold coins.

682
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,790
By now,

683
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,050
he should've received them.

684
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,520
Good.

685
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,850
But

686
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,230
ever since Lu

687
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,060
took office,

688
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,370
we've been sending him

689
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,750
ten gold coins every month.

690
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,390
It's been ten months now.

691
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:19,760
But he

692
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,310
hasn't done anything for us.

693
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,940
You don't understand.

694
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,670
The chief commander said

695
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,070
as long as Lu Si'an does nothing,

696
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,760
he's already helping

697
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,000
Taiyin Sect a great deal.

698
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:42,450
[Commander's Mansion]

699
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,430
Liao Xin

700
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,390
acted like he wanted to help,

701
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,520
but I think

702
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,880
he just wants the relic.

703
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,650
Ma Meng, the judicial adjutant, is awful too.

704
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,300
He actually said Lu Lingfeng

705
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,710
has sided with Taiyin Sect.

706
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,630
Nonsense!

707
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,270
That's bullshit!

708
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,080
So,

709
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,790
we must meet

710
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,620
Grand Commander Lu Si'an today.

711
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,030
Otherwise,

712
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,080
we'll be in prison tomorrow.

713
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,670
What did we do?

714
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,680
Lu Lingfeng

715
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,990
has joined Taiyin Sect.

716
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,510
They'll definitely suspect

717
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,960
that we're his accomplices.

718
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,820
But we've been waiting

719
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
for the whole day.

720
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,950
Grand Commander Lu

721
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,950
just won't see us.

722
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,260
The front gate is locked.

723
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,870
What should we do?

724
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,850
Since we can't go in through the front gate,

725
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,180
why don't we try our luck

726
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,830
at the back door?

727
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,230
Who are you?

728
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,590
Give me your money!

729
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,870
What?

730
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,630
Are you trying to

731
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,320
rob us?

732
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,900
Cut the crap.

733
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,530
Do it if you don't want to die!

734
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,150
We're not shouting to have you arrested

735
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,430
for stealing from the Commander's Mansion,

736
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,550
yet you want to rob us on your way out?

737
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,560
Yes, I'm robbing you.

738
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,430
So what?

739
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,830
Yingtao.

740
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,420
Gold!

741
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,990
He's not an ordinary thief.

742
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,070
He actually stole a gold coin

743
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,640
from the Commander's Mansion.

744
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:54,850
No, no, no.

745
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,750
I'm here to send Lu Si'an

746
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,750
gold coins.

747
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,070
You're lying!

748
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,110
How dare you frame Commander Lu!

749
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,790
I'm telling the truth.

750
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,880
Lu Si'an has been in Hanzhou for ten months.

751
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,070
On this day every month,

752
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,990
I'm ordered to deliver a bag of gold coins to him.

753
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,750
I counted. Ten in each bag.

754
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,640
I took one for myself each time.

755
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:12,920
I don't think Lu Si'an

756
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,850
will tell the sect leader about it.

757
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,100
The sect leader?

758
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,670
You're from Taiyin Sect?

759
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,630
Why don't you have the rhino tattoo?

760
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,110
Who told you everyone in Taiyin Sect

761
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,170
has a rhino tattoo?

762
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,390
I work undercover.

763
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,840
Of course I don't have a tattoo.

764
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,640
Then who do you take orders from?

765
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,750
I…

766
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,830
Luo Qian.

767
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,110
He's a captain,

768
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,990
inferior to Major Linghu Shuo,

769
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,920
who's inferior to the lieutenant.

770
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,030
But I've never met the lieutenant.

771
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,660
Luo Qian?

772
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,350
Linghu Shuo?

773
00:38:51,950 --> 00:39:01,460
[Commander's Mansion]

774
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,850
You guys again.

775
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,290
Why is he tied up?

776
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,950
What on earth do you want?

777
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,990
Give this gold coin

778
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,660
to Lu Si'an.

779
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,940
Tell him that it's not a bribe,

780
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,750
but a piece of evidence!

781
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,150
Hurry up.

782
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,800
[Lu Si'an, the commander of Hanzhou]

783
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,020
Untie him.

784
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,610
Commander Lu.

785
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,150
I don't think

786
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,940
you should untie him now.

787
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,680
Take down these four people!

788
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,410
Thank you, Commander.

789
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,630
You're Detective Di's disciple.

790
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,710
So you shouldn't

791
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,830
be an idiot.

792
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,510
Not necessarily.

793
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,390
You killed my gold goose

794
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,230
and made such a big fuss about it!

795
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,650
You just want the whole world

796
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,850
to know I've been taking bribes, right?

797
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,750
Today,

798
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,500
if I kill you to keep my secret safe,

799
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,380
you have only yourself to blame.

800
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,670
I'm on your turf.

801
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,310
If you want to kill me,

802
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,070
you don't even need a good excuse.

803
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,430
But why have you

804
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,790
invited me in?

805
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:50,850
I heard

806
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,100
you and Lu Lingfeng were coming to Hanzhou,

807
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,960
but it took you so long to get here.

808
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,080
I thought you two

809
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,510
had died halfway.

810
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,510
Thank you for your concern.

811
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,990
Why would I be concerned?

812
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,670
It's not like we're friends or related.

813
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,730
Moreover,

814
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,950
how do you know whether someone in Chang'an

815
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:14,870
has asked me

816
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,950
to kill both of you?

817
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,270
I don't know.

818
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,270
That's why after arriving in Hanzhou,

819
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:27,790
we didn't dare come to see you.

820
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:35,790
Out!

821
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,490
Get out!

822
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,710
-Don't push me.
-Get out!

823
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,270
Move!

824
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,030
Brother?

825
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,070
Brother.

826
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,640
Any news about him?

827
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,070
Are you alright?

828
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,400
What could happen to me?

829
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,420
They didn't give you a hard time, did they?

830
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,030
They…

831
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,990
T-They wouldn't dare.

832
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:03,880
Alright.

833
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,150
Let's go back.

834
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,070
Wait.

835
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,510
What about Lu Lingfeng?

836
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,140
There's nothing we can do now.

837
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,500
We can only go back and wait.
