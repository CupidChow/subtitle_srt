Can I leave now?

Come.

Yes.

Wait.

15
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,320
Why are you flogging me?

16
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,240

in order to get the Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal,

20
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,440
you once bought it from tomb robbers.

21
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,930
How many ancient tombs

near 9 p.m.

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,190
He went to the burial goods store

and ignited the fire starter,

I misspoke.

84
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,460
I've also said those words before,

85
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,110
but what I said just now

86

was what my teacher Detective Di said.

87
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,640
I'll keep that in mind.

Go to the Lingdu Burial Goods Store.

91

The murder happened at night,

92

125

Where'd you get demoted to?

126
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,760

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,550
Their crossbows and swords

196
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,280
belong to the Imperial Guards.

197
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,620
When we left Chang'an,

198
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,430
Lu Tong said he was going to kill my sworn brother.

199
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,570
If he didn't send the assassin,

200
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,350
then who?

201
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,010
The three people who fought with me

202
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,670
were indeed Imperial Guards.

203
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,400
But that vicious hidden weapon

204
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,660
was not used by them.

205
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,630
Were there

206
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,840
two groups of assassins?

207
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,150
That's right.

208
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,230
The soldiers of Tang are upright and honest,

209
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,090
especially the Imperial Guards.

210
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,550
They'll never use poisoned arrows.

211
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,190
Two groups of assassins.

212
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,960
Who is trying to kill my sworn brother?

213
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,670
This government office is really barren.

214
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,830
I searched the kitchen for a long time

215
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,430
before finding everything.

216
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:57,840
Here.

217
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,030
I made you a bowl of soup noodles.

218
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,470
Eat it while it's hot.

219
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,740
Soup noodles?

220
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,670
There is no such food in Nanzhou.

221
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,070
Qinghong,

222
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
shouldn't you make wontons?

223
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,670
You called me by the wrong name again.

224
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,060
My name is Chuntiao.

225
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,870
You don't have a mole.

226
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,790
You are Qinghong.

227
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,470
Anyway, I'm your wife.

228
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,330
You can call me anything.

229
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,790
Here.

230
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,170
Let me feed you.

231
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,680
She is my wife.

232
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,350
She is my Qinghong.

233
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,750
Qinghong.

234
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,360
Qinghong!

235
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,040
[Dugu]

236
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,080
Qinghong.

237
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,360
Don't be afraid.

238
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,670
It's me.

239
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,160
You cried when I cried yesterday.

240
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,080
I thought you were a kind person.

241
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,700
I didn't expect you to be a beast inside.

242
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,350
Why are you scolding me?

243
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,190
Are you crazy?

244
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,390
Why are you in my house

245
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,720
so early in the morning?

246
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,030
You're wrong.

247
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,270
I returned home.

248
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,350
Didn't you

249
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,600
make me a bowl of soup noodles just now?

250
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,390
It was so good.

251
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Where did I put it?

252
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,480
Why are you shouting?

253
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,740
Is there a thief?

254
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,030
No, Mother.

255
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:31,830
I...

256
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,180
I had a dream.

257
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,360
My son came into your dream.

258
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,790
He's still thinking about you.

259
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,780
My son

260
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,590
is really benevolent.

261
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,710
The coroner's family

262
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,490
doesn't close its doors at night.

263
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,230
No thief dares to come either,

264
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,310
but yesterday, the thief Chunshan

265
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,800
committed robbery during the day.

266
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,980
The county magistrate arrested him on the spot.

267
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,380
I forgot to tell you.

268
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,580
Got it,

269
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,830
Mother.

270
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,710
Magistrate?

271
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,380
Who is it?

272
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,710
It's you.

273
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,550
Me?

274
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,870
I'm a magistrate?

275
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,150
That was all a dream.

276
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,230
I don't dare to believe it.

277
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,750
Honey.

278
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,320
You're truly crazy.

279
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,190
Leave now.

280
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,950
Jump out of the window.

281
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,190
If my mother sees you,

282
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,790
I won't be able to explain it.

283
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,450
Jump out of the window?

284
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,440
A scholar can't do that.

285
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,910
You don't know how?

286
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,710
Learn from me.

287
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,950
Where are you going?

288
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,250
Mother.

289
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,750
Were you scared by my son in your dream?

290
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,910
Don't be afraid.

291
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,790
It's still early.

292
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,790
Go back to sleep.

293
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,390
Yes.

294
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,950
Mother,

295
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,150
what are you doing?

296
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,230
It's getting cold.

297
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,510
I found some thick firewood

298
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,150
and some blankets.

299
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,450
I will nail your room's window

300
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,500
shut.

301
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,320
When winter comes,

302
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,170
it'll be warm.

303
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,390
Leave now.

304
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:15,950
Why don't you

305
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,280
explain it to my mother?

306
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,270
Chuntiao,

307
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,020
let me ask you.

308
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,510
My son has passed away.

309
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,490
Have you ever thought of remarrying?

310
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,480
You're not answering.

311
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,420
You must want to remarry.

312
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,110
No, Mother.

313
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,630
I...

314
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,750
I mean

315
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,120
I will follow the custom

316
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,820
and only leave this family.

317
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,990
when I can remarry.

318
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,100
Why do you want to remarry?

319
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,430
Do I treat you badly?

320
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,370
No.

321
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,790
Mother, come here.

322
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,140
There's a thief!

323
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,190
Thief?

324
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,030
It's the magistrate?

325
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,980
I'm the magistrate?

326
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,070
Did he do anything to you?

327
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,790
No.

328
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,590
Leave.

329
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,960
My son just died

330
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,900
and you came to his wife's bedroom.

331
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,930
It won't be good if others find out.

332
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,270
Brother?

333
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,340
Dugu Yang?

334
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,990
Don't blame him.

335
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,270
Look at him.

336
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,830
He's here,

337
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,190
but his soul is not.

338
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,840
This is Shiyang.

339
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,660
This...

340
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,960
This is my brother

341
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Dugu Yang's home.

342
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,910
Yes.

343
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,280
You are my sister-in-law.

344
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,760
Your name is Chuntiao.

345
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,750
What have I done?

346
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,500
What have I done?

347
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,080
It's not Qinghong.

348
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,510
Qinghong died.

349
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,990
She died in Nanzhou.

350
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,430
You're awake?

351
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,570
Are you feeling better?

352
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,850
Physician Fei,

353
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,380
I had a dream again.

354
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,310
It wasn't just a dream.

355
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,430
You were sleepwalking.

356
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,330
Sleepwalking?

357
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
It's all my fault.

358
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,960
I didn't realize you were injured sooner.

359
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,070
The poison used by the assassin

360
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,160
can cause hallucinations.

361
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,380
But it's okay now.

362
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,430
I drugged you again.

363
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,560
You shouldn't sleepwalk anymore.

364
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,920
It's all thanks to Coroner Dugu's wife.

365
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,120
She carried you back.

366
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,470
Who?

367
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,590
The wife of Coroner Dugu.

368
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,470
Xijun also met her.

369
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,630
She said she looked like

370
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,440
Qinghong, your deceased wife.

371
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,480
Yes.

372
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,110
They're too similar.

373
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,740
[Shiyang County Office]

374
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,690
General Lu.

375
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,480
I heard you're leaving.

376
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,840
Let's talk outside.

377
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,110
I searched Shiyang County

378
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,910
this morning,

379
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,360
but I didn't find

380
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,150
where the assassins are hiding.

381
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,210
We're in the light.

382
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,680
They are in the shadows.

383
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,260
We can only publish a notice.

384
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,030
You want the people in the city

385
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,510
to report suspsicious people, right?

386
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,510
I'll draft it now.

387
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:33,950
Wait.

388
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,070
Tell them the mysterious assassin attacked Shiyang at night

389
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,310
and killed Mr. Su and another

390
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,010
from Chang'an.

391
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,590
Ask the people of Shiyang County to provide clues

392
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,790
and help the government office

393
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,990
arrest the assassin.

394
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,400
Killed?

395
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:50,920
But Mr. Su...

396
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,930
For him to live,

397
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,560
this is the only way.

398
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,560
General Lu, you mean

399
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,510
the assassin

400
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,670
was after Mr. Su.

401
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,470
Shiyang is an ancient county.

402
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,720
People should be simple

403
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
and live in peace.

404
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,910
If Su Wuming hadn't

405
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,830
come to see you, the new county magistrate,

406
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,670
for free food,

407
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,690
how could this have happened?

408
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,510
Make him leave after he wakes up.

409
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,710
Don't implicate the people of Shiyang.

410
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,030
I shall leave as well.

411
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,710
Why do you say so, General Lu?

412
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,770
Mr. Su was just passing by.

413
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,070
There was a strange murder in our county

414
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,350
and the position of sheriff has been vacant.

415
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,710
I'm the new magistrate

416
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,510
and new at this field.

417
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,510
I know nothing.

418
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,110
That's why he stayed

419
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,630
to teach me how to investigate cases.

420
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,630
He was busy all day

421
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,950
and didn't even have a decent meal.

422
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,210
How could you say he's here for free food?

423
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,230
A strange murder?

424
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,210
Has it been solved?

425
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,030
No.

426
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,380
When we were attacked last night,

427
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,100
Mr. Su was taking me

428
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,920
to investigate the crime scene.

429
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,810
What kind of strange murder case

430
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,580
can Shiyang have?

431
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,180
[Lingdu Burial Goods Store]

432
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,040
You wrote this down?

433
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,040
Is there anything missing

434
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,440
from what Su Wuming said?

435
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,290
I don't think so.

436
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,160
I wrote down

437
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,520
everything Mr. Su said.

438
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,840
General Lu,

439
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,270
you...

440
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,050
Niu Daming,

441
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,860
Dong Haogu,

442
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,980
and Chunshan's testimonies

443
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,020
all have suspicious points.

444
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,820
How can it be concluded hastily?

445
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,500
Mr. Su did say

446
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,690
one of them lied.

447
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,380
How can we not investigate it?

448
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,730
Where is Chunshan detained?

449
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,530
Take me there.

450
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,670
Lu Lingfeng.

451
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
Aren't you leaving?

452
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,070
Why do you want to see prisoners now?

453
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,030
I wanted to leave

454
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,910
because I didn't want to see Su Wuming.

455
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,510
I'm not leaving

456
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,910
because there's an unsolved murder case in Shiyang County.

457
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,830
Magistrate Dugu

458
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,900
is an old friend of Nanzhou.

459
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,260
I can't let him suffer.

460
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,390
He's in a hurry to solve the case for you.

461
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,590
You don't think he's being nosy, right?

462
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,790
General Lu

463
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,830
is helping me.

464
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,480
That's great.

465
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,710
I was thinking

466
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,910
to stay for a few more days.

467
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,440
I have to see Su Wuming and Yingtao

468
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,150
recover.

469
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,580
But my stomach

470
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,670
is growling.

471
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,610
You're the county magistrate.

472
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,550
Can you ask someone

473
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,990
to get me two chickens?

474
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,750
Please forgive me

475
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,850
Please forgive me.

476
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,720
-It’s you.
-It’s you.

477
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,210
No wonder the name sounded familiar.

478
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,140
Turns out you are

479
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,890
that upright and proud fellow.

480
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,670
Why are you here?

481
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,260
They got the wrong person.

482
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,880
You're an official from the capital.

483
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,570
Tell them

484
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,620
to let me go.

485
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,950
When he was searched,

486
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,480
you only found gambling tools

487
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,410
but not ten taels of silver ingots?

488
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,270
Correct.

489
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,910
Chunshan,

490
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,780
did you steal

491
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
the silver ingots

492
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,550
in Qingchuan Town?

493
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,040
No.

494
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,110
Then why don't you dare

495
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,240
to carry it with you?

496
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,750
Where did you hide it?

497
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,750
I didn't hide it.

498
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:18,630
I...

499
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,650
I just went to the gambling house.

500
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,870
You lost?

501
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,270
I'm afraid

502
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,670
I won't be able to

503
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,070
ever improve my bad luck.

504
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,070
I thought you were from a rich family.

505
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,790
I didn't know until I arrived in Shiyang

506
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,910
that you're idle

507
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,990
and unemployed.

508
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,130
Even officials

509
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,070
in the capital

510
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,870
might not have those silver ingots.

511
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,480
Where did you get them from?

512
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,580
Tell us the truth.

513
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,530
Yang gave them to me.

514
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,760
Gave them to you?

515
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,520
You sneaked into the burial goods store at night,

516
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,590
stole the silver ingots, and was discovered by Dugu Yang.

517
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,950
Out of desperation,

518
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,580
you killed him.

519
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,110
I...

520
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,420
I didn't.

521
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,470
He is cunning.

522
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,270
He should have been tortured yesterday.

523
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:13,730
Guards!

524
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,400
Yes.

525
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,730
Torture him

526
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,190
until he confesses.

527
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,750
Yes.

528
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,150
No, no, no.

529
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,760
I didn't kill Dugu Yang.

530
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
It was Dugu Yang who killed someone.

531
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,710
Nonsense.

532
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,330
I'm going to torture you.

533
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,710
No.

534
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,600
I dare not.

535
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,640
I'll tell you everything this time.

536
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,100
Really.

537
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,430
He deals with these things every day.

538
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,630
They scared me silly.

539
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,750
Your gambling addiction flared

540
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,810
when you saw money.

541
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,830
Not exactly.

542
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,750
I heard some noise in the backyard.

543
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,130
I was afraid someone would see me

544
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,260
and say I was a thief,

545
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,270
so I could only go to the gambling house

546
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,070
to try my luck.

547
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,960
It kept thundering at the time.

548
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,640
It started raining shortly

549
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,350
after I left the burial goods store.

550
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,770
Big.

551
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,290
Place your bets.

552
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,350
Place your bets.

553
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,350
Big. Small.

554
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,710
Big. Small.

555
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,030
Go away.

556
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,960
Place your bets.

557
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,670
Go away.

558
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,830
Go away.

559
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,350
Small.

560
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,710
Small.

561
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,330
Why are you here again?

562
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,240
Do you have money?

563
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,100
Of course.

564
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,200
Use my gambling tools again.

565
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,310
After you lost all your money,

566
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,910
did you return to the burial goods store?

567
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,390
Yes.

568
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,680
I planned to convince Dugu Yang

569
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,190
to sell the seal and split the money

570
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:02,950
with me.

571
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,380
Shameless bastard.

572
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,750
Were you planning on returning

573
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,070
to the gambling house with the money?

574
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,390
I...

575
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,150
When was that?

576
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,010
Around

577
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,660
9 p.m.

578
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,790
Who is it?

579
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,990
An old friend.

580
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,310
Old friend?

581
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,490
It was raining heavily

582
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,410
and Dugu Yang still got a guest.

583
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,090
I had to wait a little longer.

584
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,470
But the more I waited,

585
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,040
the more wrong things felt.

586
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,120
Listen, coroner.

587
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,910
If you don't want to die,

588
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,710
two conditions.

589
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,070
One,

590
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,070
don't make these clay figurines

591
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,240
[Tomb Robber Lu Er]

592
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,390
with hidden weapons anymore.

593
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:58,790
Two,

594
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,550
draw a diagram of the

595
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,350
killer clay figurine.

596
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,190
I'll pick it up tomorrow night.

597
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,030
Why?

598
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,840
This is the skill I use to feed myself.

599
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,050
You have no right

600
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,380
to stop me from doing this.

601
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,910
And you want the diagram?

602
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
You're a tomb robber, right?

603
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,710
Aren't you afraid I'll report you to the officers?

604
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,510
Stubborn.

605
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,190
I'll kill you today.

606
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,510
Yang,

607
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,270
let's capture him together

608
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,430
and send him to the government office.

609
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,550
We can earn 1,000 taels.

610
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,430
It's a rule set by the new county magistrate

611
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,430
You want to die?

612
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,150
Yang,

613
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,390
save me!

614
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,750
Yang,

615
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,310
he's dead.

616
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,110
He's dead.

617
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,960
If he's dead,

618
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,350
can he still be exchanged for 1,000 taels?

619
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,330
He's dead.

620
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,910
Who can prove that he's a tomb robber?

621
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,380
Yang,

622
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,150
you killed him,

623
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,370
not me.

624
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,950
I mean...

625
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,790
What should we do now?

626
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Don't tell anyone

627
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,840
about this.

628
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,090
Well...

629
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,270
I can't control my mouth.

630
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,910
You—

631
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,520
Unless you give me some money

632
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,160
for me to leave this place.

633
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,590
You're blackmailing me?

634
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,830
I did it to save your life.

635
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,550
I have no choice.

636
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,980
I only have one sister

637
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,950
and she married you.

638
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,300
I'm too poor to survive now.

639
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,310
Yang,

640
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,910
I heard you have a seal.

641
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,850
Why don't you give it to me?

642
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,750
Bastard!

643
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,750
What are you doing?

644
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,590
You want to kill me?

645
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,170
Where is the seal?

646
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,970
There is no treasure seal at all.

647
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,720
Take ten taels of silver

648
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,860
and leave Shiyang County.

649
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,510
Never come back.

650
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,270
Then...

651
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,520
Do you have more?

652
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,790
Greedy people

653
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,160
deserve to die.

654
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,550
Actually,

655
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,489
ten taels was not a small amount.

656
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,230
I'd never seen

657
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,560
so much money in my life.

658
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,090
But in Qingchuan Town,

659
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,310
I saw Guo

660
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,800
could get so many treasures

661
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,960
with a fake seal.

662
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,860
I must be able to get

663
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,810
a fortune with the real seal.

664
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,810
Then I thought carefully.

665
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,690
The real treasure seal

666
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,290
must be in Dugu Yang's hands.

667
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,730
Otherwise,

668
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Dong Haogu wouldn't have begged me.

669
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,630
Dugu Yang had the seal,

670
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,659
but he made my sister suffer.

671
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,190
As his brother-in-law,

672
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,699
I hadn't gained anything either.

673
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,050
Now he wanted to use ten taels of silver

674
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,420
for me to cover up for his murder?

675
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,389
No way!

676
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,389
So I went back to Shiyang.

677
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,250
I didn't expect

678
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,429
he was already dead.

679
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,880
Where is the body of the victim?

680
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,550
I don't know.

681
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,670
Dugu Yang told me to leave it alone.

682
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,370
General Lu.

683
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Are you confident

684
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,660
the body can be found in the store?

685
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,310
Great.

686
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,030
You and Mr. Su

687
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,830
think alike.

688
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,030
What?

689
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,140
We'll find something

690
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,500
by investigating the scene tonight.

691
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,380
If things are as expected,

692
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,530
another body

693
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,850
should be hidden in the store.

694
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,800
Dugu Xiashu,

695
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,010
are you going to keep

696
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,270
flattering Su Wuming?

697
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,350
He didn't find out

698
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,410
that Dugu Yang killed someone.

699
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,540
How could he think of finding the body?

700
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,240
I was curious too,

701
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,070
so I asked.

702
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,390
Body?

703
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,180
Whose body

704
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,650
are you talking about?

705
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,670
I'm not sure yet.

706
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,640
But this case is complicated.

707
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,800
I'm afraid Dugu Yang wasn't

708
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,630
the only one

709
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,640
who died at the burial goods store last night.

710
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,510
Did Su Wuming tell you

711
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,000
where to find the body?

712
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,350
No.

713
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,530
Remember.

714
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,670
Murderers usually hide the body

715
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,130
by using their specialty.

716
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,280
General Lu, you mean...

717
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,550
No need to write it down yet.

718
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,650
We'll talk about it when we find it.

719
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,150
Let's go.

720
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,450
In the clay figurine.

721
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,980
The body is in the clay figurine.

722
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,510
What are you mumbling about?

723
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,230
Are you still investigating in your dream?

724
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,230
The body

725
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,390
is in

726
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,530
the clay figurine.

727
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,570
In the clay figurine.

728
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:05,820
Xijun.

729
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,520
Let's go.

730
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,110
Let me take you for a walk.

731
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,350
Where are we going?

732
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,680
To investigate the case with Lu Lingfeng.

733
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,910
Can't you see?

734
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,790
Lu from Fanyang

735
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,280
is competing this time.

736
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,190
He wants to solve this

737
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,690
clay figurine murder case

738
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,270
before Su Wuming

739
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,350
wakes up.

740
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,830
Do you think

741
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,020
we should go help

742
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,670
or to make trouble?

743
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,220
But Yingtao…

744
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,510
Don't worry.

745
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,150
She knows martial arts.

746
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,010
Her body is fit.

747
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,110
She's much better than that scholar.

748
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,370
She will wake up first.

749
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,430
But

750
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,390
it won't be that soon.

751
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,350
Let's go.

752
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,080
[Lingdu Burial Goods Store]

753
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,430
Mr. Su said

754
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,430
these clay figurines

755
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,750
are used against tomb robbers.

756
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,090
They contain hidden weapons.

757
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,420
Be careful, General Lu.

758
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,560
Step back.

759
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,160
Magistrate.

760
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,810
Remove it and break it open.

761
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,060
Have Chunshan identify him.

762
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,230
This...

763
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,810
This isn't the man that Dugu Yang killed.

764
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,590
Lou Qingtai?

765
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,830
General Lu,

766
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,000
it's Lou Qingtai, the son of

767
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,000
the executioner, Lou Lide.

768
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,810
You all, look.

769
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,310
It's Lou Qingtai.

770
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,370
It really is Lou Qingtai.

771
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,850
There really was a body in the clay figurine.

772
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,390
What do you mean?

773
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,110
Su Wuming was talking in his sleep.

774
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,180
He said...

775
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,780
Clay figurine, body.

776
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,290
Clay figurine, body.

777
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,750
As expected,

778
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,360
the body was hidden

779
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,990
in the half-finished clay figurine.

780
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,240
Bring the body out.

781
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,910
Could it be

782
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,190
that Lou Qingtai came to seek revenge

783
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,190
but was killed by Dugu Yang instead?

784
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,880
Don't make such an assumption.

785
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,960
Where is the female coroner Cao Hui

786
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,670
who examined Dugu Yang?

787
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,520
Can you invite her over?

788
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,360
Okay, I'll arrange it.

789
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,040
Can I borrow your sword?

790
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,590
Stay away for now.

791
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,620
Let's go.

792
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,550
Let's go.

793
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,520
General Lu, you're so skilled.

794
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,590
How did he know?

795
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,960
Remove it and break it open.

796
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,420
Yes.

797
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,190
It was him.

798
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,830
I didn't kill him.

799
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,980
It was Dugu Yang.

800
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,370
Bring the tomb robber Lu Da

801
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,070
to identify the body.

802
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:57,950
Yes.

803
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,030
Get out of the way!

804
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:01,470
Move!

805
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,550
I, Cao Hui, the female coroner of Tang's Shiyang County,

806
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,080
am here to examine the body.

807
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,350
Unrelated people,

808
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,280
step back.

809
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,050
Please.

810
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,290
General Lu,

811
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,580
this old woman

812
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,230
has gone crazy for years.

813
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,230
The last postmortem was for her son.

814
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,360
It was a lucky break.

815
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,670
I'm afraid it's inappropriate

816
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,050
for her to be the coroner now.

817
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,870
Assistant Xu.

818
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,830
My mother

819
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,350
sometimes isn't clear-headed,

820
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,510
but she's never uncertain

821
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,770
with her postmortems.

822
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,030
Ignore him.

823
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,110
Postmortems require focus.

824
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,980
Don't listen to the gossip.

825
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,870
Yes.

826
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,560
Chuntiao,

827
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,430
my son is not here.

828
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,790
Record in his place.

829
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,030
Yes.

830
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,920
You can write?

831
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,170
I'm not good at writing.

832
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,290
It's rare to know how to write.

833
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,270
Don't talk to each other.

834
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,030
Record it carefully.

835
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:11,950
Yes.
