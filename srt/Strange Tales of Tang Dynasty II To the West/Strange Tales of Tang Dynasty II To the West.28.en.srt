4
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,870
I say, ladies,

5
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,180
why don't you

6
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,950
tell us about your heroic night trip to Yunding

7
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,940
Immortal Steps

8
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,990
in details?

9
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,430
I think it's alright.

10
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,690
I'll take a look later.

11
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,289
That's Zhao Yu.

12
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,870
I saw him.

13
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,510
That day, at Anyuan Inn,

14
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,770
anyone could tell that

15
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,870
he didn't trust us

16
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,570
and remained on guard.

17
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,190
He's been in Yunding for many days.

18
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,870
Maybe

19
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,550
he has already found some important clues.

20
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,550
Let's follow him.

21
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,570
One more pot of wine.

22
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,500
Sure thing, Fed.

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,090
Who's there?

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,829
It's foul to stalk me in the dark.

25
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,950
Show yourself

26
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,600
and let me see your face.

27
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,750
It's you two.

28
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,190
Where are the two who claim to be

29
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,240
Detective Di's disciples?

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,170
They have important cases at hand.

31
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,100
You alone

32
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,470
are not worthy of those two big shots

33
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,740
to personally take action.

34
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,510
Crazy woman.

35
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,290
Stop following me.

36
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,430
Stop right there.

37
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,430
I don't care about

38
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,190
the names you call me.

39
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,510
I can see that

40
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,000
you're anxious because

41
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,630
your brother is missing.

42
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,120
You've been in Yunding for many days,

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,850
you must have some clues by now.

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,430
Why don't you tell us

45
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,550
so we can help you search together?

46
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,400
The two of you? Help me?

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,920
We've aided

48
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,030
Su Wuming and Lu Lingfeng

49
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,520
in solving a few big cases.

50
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,680
You better show some respect.

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,470
If you want me to respect you,

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,470
you have to ask my Heng sword

53
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,400
for permission.

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,400
Let's fight then.

55
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,000
Actually, you guys

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,730
really don't need to follow me.

57
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,750
I just heard that

58
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,029
there are people selling slaves at Yunding Immortal Steps.

59
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,430
They're mute slaves, too.

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,290
So I decided to find out the truth.

61
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,870
Yunding Immortal Steps?

62
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,070
We've also heard of this place.

63
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,780
What kind of place is it?

64
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,990
It's said to be

65
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,070
a building built on a hillside.

66
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,950
There are taverns,

67
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,590
jewelry stores, spice shops, leather goods stores,

68
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,720
dye shops, and so on.

69
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,260
There are even places for slave trading.

70
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,590
Gathering all sorts of

71
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,830
trades and services

72
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,780
in a single building.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,430
Even Chang'an and Luoyang

74
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,760
don't have such a place.

75
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,110
It's located in Jinyu House in the northwest corner of the city.

76
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,909
It's said that

77
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,270
normal trading is done during the day.

78
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,260
But at nightfall,

79
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,540
from 10 p.m. onward,

80
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,230
a terrifying hunting game

81
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,620
will begin.

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,760
What is a hunting game?

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,940
If I could explain it clearly,

84
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,610
why would I need to take the risk to investigate?

85
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,150
However,

86
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,340
although my brother is a scholar,

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,150
he doesn't only read books of sages and worthies.

88
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,400
He especially loves to read some

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,510
strange tales and miscellaneous stories.

90
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,710
He is extremely curious

91
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,710
about new things.

92
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,710
I think

93
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,590
he might have participated in

94
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,270
that game.

95
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,680
Yunding actually has such a building?

96
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,710
I think these people

97
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,909
are not decent folks.

98
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,990
They do seem like a bunch of reckless ruffians.

99
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,920
I lost the fight.

100
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,200
So I kept my promise

101
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,320
and brought you to Yunding Immortal Steps.

102
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
You can leave now.

103
00:05:59,470 --> 00:05:59,940
Leave?

104
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,150
Where to?

105
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,670
Since we're here,

106
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,050
we must look around

107
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,670
and see

108
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,950
what's so immortal about

109
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,390
this place.

110
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,550
But you can't even get in.

111
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,670
What do you mean?

112
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,910
Yunding Immortal Steps

113
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,390
can be visited freely during the day.

114
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,590
But after nightfall,

115
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,440
you need to wear a mask to enter.

116
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,470
Do you have masks?

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,990
To think there's such a place within the county,

118
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,190
it's indeed strange.

119
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,300
However,

120
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,710
since it belongs to Jinyu House,

121
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,110
we can ask the house director about it.

122
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,020
[Jinyu House]

123
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,790
It was really lively over there just now.

124
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,110
Let's go there again next time.

125
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,590
Okay.

126
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,470
Is the director in?

127
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,810
The Jinyu House doesn't have a director.

128
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,270
Why not?

129
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,190
If there's a director, he must manage the place.

130
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,120
That includes managing the Yunding Immortal Steps.

131
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,490
Who's capable of doing that?

132
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,150
I was just about to ask you

133
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,180
about Yunding Immortal Steps...

134
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,220
You're a woman.

135
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,870
Why are you asking about that place?

136
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,200
Do you have a death wish?

137
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,710
You...

138
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,110
[Chongyan Mask Shop]

139
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,310
A mask shop?

140
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,070
Since we need a mask

141
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,110
to enter Yunding Immortal Steps

142
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,030
after dark,

143
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,590
wouldn't it be perfect for us

144
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,320
to ask the shopkeeper about it?

145
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
That mask shop

146
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,750
originally didn't have much business.

147
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,880
More than a year ago,

148
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,510
since Yunding Immortal Steps started operating,

149
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,170
business suddenly picked up.

150
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,409
We pretended

151
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,230
that our husbands

152
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,670
wanted to participate in the hunting game

153
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,750
and asked us to choose masks for them.

154
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,150
Only then were they willing to

155
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,010
haggle with us.

156
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,850
Otherwise,

157
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,990
they would have directly kicked us out.

158
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,390
Good excuse.

159
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,010
Were the masks expensive?

160
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,890
Extremely expensive.

161
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,950
Wait a minute.

162
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,240
These two shabby things

163
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,620
cost us a silver ingot.

164
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,690
So expensive?

165
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,710
Compared to the reward,

166
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,330
it's not expensive at all.

167
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,390
You...

168
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,870
Boss, please tell me

169
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,230
about the hunting game.

170
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,830
How exactly do you play it?

171
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,270
You're sending your husbands

172
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,730
to their deaths without knowing about that?

173
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,270
Get out!

174
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,500
Both of you, get out.

175
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,070
I'll take the mask.

176
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,190
He only agreed to talk after taking the money.

177
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,909
That game is extremely dangerous.

178
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,830
How exactly is it played?

179
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,190
For example, if you want to participate,

180
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,920
you have to pay a deposit first.

181
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,700
According to the rules, it's at least 10,000 coins.

182
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,510
Then, at 10 p.m.,

183
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,680
before the main gate is locked,

184
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,190
enter the Yunding Immortal Steps.

185
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,850
After that,

186
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,390
find a place to hide.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,740
If you have martial arts skills,

188
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,910
you can defeat all the assassins instead.

189
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,660
By dawn,

190
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,880
as long as you're still alive,

191
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,130
you can get a tenfold reward.

192
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,460
During this period,

193
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,860
if an assassin kills you,

194
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,080
your deposit will belong to Yunding Immortal Steps.

195
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,310
Within Yunding County,

196
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,310
I can't believe someone would set up this kind of game.

197
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,270
Indeed.

198
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,640
I, Su, have also traveled to

199
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,550
quite a few places.

200
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,550
But I've never heard of such a game.

201
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,350
Then I asked the boss

202
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,270
why the county government wasn't regulating such a

203
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,390
deadly and evil game.

204
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:34,790
Yeah.

205
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,970
What did he say?

206
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,310
The boss wasn't sure either.

207
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,070
But I heard that

208
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,600
Yunding Immortal Steps

209
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,710
has to pay a lot of taxes

210
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,170
to the county every month.

211
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:44,910
Moreover,

212
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,430
they have long reached an agreement with the county government.

213
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,360
During the game,

214
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,220
the assassins in the building will not be held accountable.

215
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,270
So,

216
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,030
from Luoyang, Chang'an,

217
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,980
to Ak-Beshim,

218
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,830
and even farther places like Merv

219
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,550
and Balkh,

220
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,620
greedy people would

221
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,610
come to Yunding

222
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,390
to participate in this game.

223
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,030
There are also some Jianghu figures

224
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,390
who come to act as assassins

225
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,590
to earn a commission.

226
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,080
Some do it for the thrills.

227
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,310
Then...

228
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,710
are there many people who make it out

229
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,030
alive and get the money?

230
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,540
He knew nothing about that.

231
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,400
So the two of us

232
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,690
waited until dawn.

233
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,800
Brother.

234
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,370
Congratulations.

235
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,200
You didn't look like a martial artist,

236
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,970
but you've mastered the rat-dodging skill.

237
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,230
You dodged skillfully.

238
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,270
You guessed it right.

239
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,000
I came all the way from Gaochang

240
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,100
just for today.

241
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,310
You're quite a master yourself.

242
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,950
I admire that.

243
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,070
Let's go for a drink.

244
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,600
Let's go.

245
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,860
There were other people

246
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,830
waiting till dawn

247
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,890
like the two of you?

248
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,720
Yes.

249
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,490
And there's even a headcount.

250
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,920
Twenty-eight people entered last night.

251
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,270
Only two came out.

252
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,460
That's less than 10 percent.

253
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,860
As long as they see someone come out alive

254
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,120
with the reward money,

255
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,340
there will be people who venture in again.

256
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,750
Excluding you two,

257
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,390
those waiting and watching outside

258
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,390
probably all harbor the hope of luck

259
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,400
and plan to risk their lives

260
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,910
to gain wealth and rank.

261
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,000
Your analysis makes sense.

262
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,530
I'm worried right now.

263
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,390
I'm afraid that Zhao Yu also went in.

264
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
How could that be?

265
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,200
I clearly saw him leave.

266
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,230
If he returned with a mask,

267
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,000
would you have recognized him?

268
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,590
Zhao Yu is staying at Anyuan Inn.

269
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,840
It's not far.

270
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,620
I'll go check right now

271
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,080
to see if he's still there.

272
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,030
By the way,

273
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,410
why isn't Fed at the table with us?

274
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,980
Did he drink a lot last night?

275
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,100
Yes.

276
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,670
So I didn't wake him up.

277
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,390
Since Yunding Immortal Steps

278
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,590
is open during the day as well,

279
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,430
let's bring Fed along

280
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,530
and go check it out.

281
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,830
Maybe we can help him find that

282
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,330
Eternal Drunkenness.

283
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,410
[Flying clouds and hanging walls]

284
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,100
Fed.

285
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,910
Fed.

286
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,440
Fed...

288
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,930
When you came back this morning,

289
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,990
was Fed in his room?

290
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,830
No.

291
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,660
We thought

292
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,120
he was drunk and sleeping,

293
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,590
so we didn't check on him.

294
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,950
Is Chicken Fed also missing?

295
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,740
We need to go look for him right away.

296
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,540
Fed is a heavy drinker.

297
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,790
He might be sleeping in some tavern.

298
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,910
[Anyuan Inn]

299
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,480
How is it?

300
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,010
He left last afternoon

301
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,680
and hasn't returned since.

302
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,550
Zhao Yu

303
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,550
must have acted on his own.

304
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,910
There's even worse news.

305
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,310
What?

306
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,590
Fed?

307
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,030
Don't be anxious just yet.

308
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,360
This is my speculation.

309
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,480
Fed's situation

310
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,470
is similar to what happened to

311
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,410
Lyu Xianke.

312
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,830
They're old.

313
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,500
Even if they were made into mute slaves,

314
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,550
they wouldn't sell well.

315
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,230
So I think

316
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,200
Fed is probably in some tavern,

317
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,860
drinking himself into a stupor.

318
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,260
Then go find him quickly.

319
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,190
Go.

320
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,070
[Nan's Tavern]

321
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,150
Since the day he heard about the Eternal Drunkenness,

322
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,590
Fed has been obsessing over it.

323
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,790
In Yunding,

324
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,790
the place one is most likely

325
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,390
to find Eternal Drunkenness

326
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,790
is the Yunding Immortal Steps.

327
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,860
Someone saw him between 9 to 11 p.m.,

328
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,990
asking for directions to Jinyu House.

329
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,870
The Yunding Immortal Steps is located in Jinyu House.

330
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,670
Fed was clamoring about drinking the Eternal Drunkenness.

331
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,730
He must have gone to look for the wine.

332
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,960
Sheriff Lu!

333
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,170
Sheriff Lu.

334
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,330
We took the painting made by Miss Xijun

335
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:10,970
and went to every tavern

336
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,710
in the county

337
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,530
to ask for him.

338
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,610
We got nothing.

339
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,690
Someone did see him

340
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,350
asking around about the Eternal Drunkenness.

341
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,980
But lately,

342
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,590
there has been a shortage of Eternal Drunkenness in the county.

343
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,670
Anyone who wants the wine...

344
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,430
Can only visit Yunding Immortal Steps,

345
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:22,900
right?

346
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:23,830
Yes.

347
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,470
Sheriff Lu, you can't go in.

348
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,050
Why?

349
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,840
So many people are going in and out of the place.

350
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,950
Why can't I enter?

351
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,380
It's stipulated in the contract

352
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,160
that the Immortal Steps

353
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
is self-managed.

354
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,030
No one from the government office

355
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,910
is allowed to investigate or interfere with internal matters.

356
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,960
You cannot enter in plain clothes either.

357
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,500
Otherwise, there will be trouble.

358
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,260
Who signed such a contract?

359
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,910
The former county magistrate.

360
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,830
Mr. Song was already in office then.

361
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,830
Sheriff Sima too.

362
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,380
I remember the three of them

363
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,580
were very supportive of this contract.

364
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,740
It's Sima Liang again.

365
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,040
County officials are not allowed to enter.

00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,770
Then tell me,

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,010
as the sheriff,

368
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,750
how did he collect taxes?

369
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,300
On the first day of every month,

370
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,860
right at the entrance of Yunding Immortal Steps.

371
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,630
The tax is quite substantial.

372
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
The sheriff valued it very much.

373
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,970
He personally leads us

374
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,370
to collect it every time.

375
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,300
Then the taxpayer

376
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,030
must be the owner of the Immortal Steps.

377
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,240
Who is he?

378
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,960
It's a man called He Yulang.

on very good terms with

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,540
Mr. Sima.

382
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,850
After Sima Liang left office,

383
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,450
he even treated him to a meal.

384
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,230
I just arrived at Yunding.

385
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,150
I don't know about any agreements.

386
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,880
Since we're in Yunding County,

387
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,870
as the sheriff,

388
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,620
I have every right to enter.

389
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,660
You really can't, Sheriff Lu.

390
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,920
After dark, this place

391
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,070
holds extremely cruel hunting games.

392
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,270
How can this be legal?

393
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,080
I heard that during the day,

394
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,380
they run a market for buying and selling slaves too.

395
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,240
As the sheriff,

396
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,670
I should go investigate if

397
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,540
the slaves being traded

398
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,070
have relevant trade deeds.

399
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,240
You really can't.

400
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,580
Is that the only thing you can say?

401
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,350
Get out of my way!

402
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,030
I'm doing this for your own good!

403
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,110
Magistrate Huangfu may look

404
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,790
drunk and muddle-headed

405
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,550
every day,

406
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,990
but this Yunding Immortal Steps

407
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,700
is his stepping stone

408
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,990
for climbing up the ranks in officialdom.

409
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,870
Moreover, I heard that

410
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,230
the boss behind this business

411
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,710
is a big shot in the imperial court.

412
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,330
Even the nightly hunting games

413
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,230
have been approved by the Commander.

414
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,090
The Commander?

415
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,190
Is it Lu Si'an, Commander Lu?

416
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,030
Exactly.

417
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,190
When Commander Lu

418
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,270
just took office in Hanzhou,

419
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,670
he sent a personal letter

420
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,080
informing the county

421
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,830
that he is aware of

422
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,190
the matter of Yunding Immortal Steps.

423
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,310
He told the county to fulfill the agreement

424
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,770
and not cause any trouble.

425
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,560
In that case,

426
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,350
you really can't go in.

427
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,710
Chicken Fed is my savior.

428
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,790
Even if I have to give up being sheriff,

429
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,900
I must go up the Immortal Steps

430
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,560
to save him.

431
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,190
Right now,

432
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,750
we are not completely sure

433
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,180
that Fed is in there.

434
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,350
Besides,

435
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,020
you are a government official.

436
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,510
But we're not.

437
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,870
How about this?

438
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,770
Let me investigate

439
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,080
the Immortal Steps for you.

440
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,440
Brother.

441
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,599
There is a tavern there.

442
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,150
I've never seen him before.

443
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,030
After nightfall,

444
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,470
those who come to Yunding Immortal Steps

445
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,730
all have to wear masks.

446
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,630
So I can't see their faces either.

447
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,630
This man is quite old.

448
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,680
His clothes are very shabby.

449
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,270
He has a loud voice.

450
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,300
There was indeed someone like that at around 9 p.m.

451
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,840
He was sloppily dressed

452
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,150
and reeking of alcohol.

453
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,710
He was making a fuss, demanding to drink the Eternal Drunkenness.

454
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,440
But I don't have that in my shop.

455
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,100
So he left, cursing and swearing.

456
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,110
Thank you.

457
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,650
[Flying Fairy Body Art Store]

458
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,710
So it's really here.

459
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,060
The owner of this shop

460
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,470
is called Qing Fu.

461
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,510
The Heavenly King art on Wu Cai's back

462
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,440
and the peony on Qing Xi's shoulder

463
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,470
should all be done by him.

464
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,000
Then let's go in and have a look.

465
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,310
Wait.

466
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,020
You can't go.

467
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,030
Why not?

468
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,870
You look like a bookworm

469
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,990
and nothing like someone into body art.

470
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,320
You'll arouse suspicion if you go in there

471
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,610
and alert the enemies.

472
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,830
Xijun

473
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,470
doesn't fit the looks either.

474
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,630
You look too well-behaved.

475
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,090
Why don't you two go ahead?

476
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,360
I'll be right back.

477
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,060
Alright.

478
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,660
Forgive me for intruding

479
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,990
your inner room without

480
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,370
invitation, Mr. Qing.

481
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,540
You know my name?

482
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,810
You're Yunding's best body art artist, Qing Fu.

483
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,270
If I hadn't heard of you,

484
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,130
how could I have found my way here?

485
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,850
You want a body art?

486
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,790
What else?

487
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,520
You'll have to wait a few days.

488
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,070
I've been fully booked recently.

489
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,870
I can come at night to get it done.

490
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,150
At night?

491
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,780
I know the rules of Yunding's Immortal Steps.

492
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,140
But I believe you

493
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,790
can keep me safe.

494
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,550
Well then...

495
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,680
Let's do it tonight.

496
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,170
You're in such a hurry.

497
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,940
I came all the way from Hanzhou.

498
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,310
On the first day of next month,

499
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,830
there will be a grand banquet at the Commander's Mansion.

500
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,820
I'm invited to perform a sword dance there.

501
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,850
This will be a life-changing event

502
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,840
for me.

503
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,680
How can I not be anxious?

504
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,200
Alright,

505
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,230
tonight it is.

506
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,450
You need to wear a mask at night

507
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,420
and come straight to my body art store.

508
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,620
No wandering around.

509
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,550
And

510
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,610
you must arrive before 10 p.m.

511
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,230
It's a deal.

512
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,480
I'm afraid

513
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,590
this man

514
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,550
might be dead.

515
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,660
Why do you say that?

516
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,870
This man came to my inn last night at 9 p.m.

517
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,390
and insisted on drinking the Eternal Drunkenness.

518
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,520
He was already quite drunk at the time,

519
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,610
So I advised him...

520
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,740
Sir,

521
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,260
why don't you come back earlier tomorrow?

522
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,190
No.

523
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,870
I want to drink it now.

524
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,590
In another hour,

525
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,550
Yunding Immortal Steps

526
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,790
will be locking its doors.

527
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,050
So what if it's locked?

528
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,100
After the doors are locked,

529
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,630
the hunting game will begin.

530
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,110
You...

531
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,930
It doesn't matter.

532
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,590
Hurry and bring me

533
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,170
the Eternal Drunkenness.

534
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,310
If he hadn't taken off his mask,

535
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,710
I wouldn't have been so sure

536
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,710
it was him either.

537
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,580
I've seen plenty of people like him.

538
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,830
Most of them have paid a deposit

539
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,150
and were waiting for the hunting game.

540
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,590
So,

541
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,090
I served him the food and wine

542
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,400
before promptly leaving.

543
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,190
This morning,

544
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,120
I even specifically asked around.

545
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,860
No one saw him come out alive.

546
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,340
Doesn't that mean...

547
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,070
Impossible.

548
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,470
Chicken Fed couldn't possibly have

549
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,560
participated in the hunting game.

550
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,490
But the doors close right at 10 p.m.

551
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,350
It doesn't matter if you participate in the game or not.

552
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,010
Brother...

553
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,630
Don't worry, Sister.

554
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,990
Fed has saved countless lives in his lifetime,

555
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,450
accumulating much merit.

556
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,700
He won't easily lose his life here.

557
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,630
Qing Fu has agreed to meet me

558
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,160
after dark for the body art.

559
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,710
He dared to meet you after dark.

560
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,820
Then it's possible that

561
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,470
Qing Xi also came that night.

562
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,560
I thought so too.

563
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,100
Tonight,

564
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,510
we must find out Qing Xi's whereabouts.

565
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,710
How's your progress?

566
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,350
Chicken Fed really came

567
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,480
to a place like this.

568
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,500
The odds are against him.

You may think it's expensive now.

I must have him.

Anyone wants to raise the price further?

728
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,990
I'll count down from five to one.

729
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,080
If no one raises the price,

730
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,260
then it's a deal.

731
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,590
Five.

He bid 100,000 coins.

With this price,

00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,150
it seems we are not meant to be.

742
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,060
It has already reached this price.

You just called out 100,000 coins.

you must be able to pay up.

748
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,830
Otherwise,

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,990
you can't leave.

750
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,030
That's right.

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,360
mute slaves today.

758
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,190
All of them?

759
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,160
This is an auction.

760
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,590
Aren't there 20 more?

761
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,680
Call them all out

762
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,740
so I can inspect the goods.

763
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,510
If you are really here to buy mute slaves,

764
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,510
you have to follow the rules of Yunding Immortal Steps

765
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,790
and do it one by one.

766
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,280
If you are here to cause trouble,

767
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,600
I, He Yulang,

768
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,270
will not go easy on you.

769
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,590
What trouble?

770
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,190
I'm taking

771
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,500
all 30 of them.

772
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,910
30?

773
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,510
Show your money.

774
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:27,910
Sure.

775
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,870
But you must also promise me

776
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,950
to confirm the guarantor after the deal is done,

777
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,070
and then go to the government office together to set up the trade deed.

778
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,350
That way, I can also find out

779
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,630
the true identities of these sellers

780
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,310
and know

781
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,750
if the origins of these mute slaves

782
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,030
comply with the laws of Tang.

783
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,060
Show your money first.

784
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
The trade deed

785
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,740
will be given to you after that,

786
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,840
young master.

787
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,650
That's not acceptable.

788
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,180
According to the Tang Code,

789
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,580
the miscellaneous statutes stipulate that

790
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,040
for those who buy or sell servants,

791
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,030
if the price has been confirmed

792
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,750
but no trade deed is established,

793
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,610
they will be flogged thirty times after three days.

794
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,160
Seeing how ambiguous you are,

795
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,550
do you want these

796
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,110
buyers who came from afar

797
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,220
to be flogged together with you?

798
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,770
Bring the trade deeds here.

799
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,880
For your confirmation.

800
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,020
This is for Yun

801
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,170
slave number 232.

802
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,310
See for yourself.

803
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,790
Strange.

804
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,250
A trade deed needs

805
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,950
both seller and buyer to be present at the government office.

806
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,630
Your mute slaves

807
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,270
haven't even found buyers yet,

808
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:51,990
but

809
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,450
you already have the trade deeds in hand.

810
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,200
You don't need to worry about this.

811
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,830
You just need to fill in

812
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,900
the buyer's name on it.

813
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,830
To prevent free people from being illegally traded,

814
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,150
The Code also stipulates that

815
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,150
the slaves being sold

816
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,390
must personally confirm their slave status

817
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,250
and that they are not free people.

818
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,790
Yun 232,

819
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,150
let me ask you,

820
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,750
where were you born,

821
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,890
who are your parents,

822
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,550
and how did you become a slave?

823
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,510
Keep asking then.

824
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,490
I'm selling mute slaves!

825
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,320
How do you expect him to say it himself?

826
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,790
That's right, yes.

827
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,430
If they can't admit it in person,

828
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,960
then it's illegal trading.

829
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,560
Is the Yunding Immortal Steps

830
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,830
planning to implicate so many people

831
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,570
to break the laws of the Great Tang

832
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,130
together with you?

833
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,500
You sure talk nicely.

834
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,440
You're just here to cause trouble.

835
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,270
Guards.

836
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,270
Help me escort the guests

837
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:22,590
out of Yunding Immortal Steps.

838
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,310
Alright, alright.

839
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,710
Go out.

840
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,580
Get out. Hurry.

841
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,110
Xijun, let’s wait outside.

842
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,170
Yingtao, let's go.

843
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:28,969
Hurry up.

844
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,270
Quickly, quickly.

845
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,500
Hurry up, hurry up.

846
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,389
Go.

847
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,449
Quickly, quickly.

848
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,380
What's going on?

849
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:38,940
Yeah.

850
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,310
Get out!

851
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,460
Hurry, go, hurry up.

852
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,500
Go.

853
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,219
Hurry.

854
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,030
Brother.

855
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,389
Hurry up.

856
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,590
If we stay here,

857
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,710
we can't help him

858
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,469
and will only distract him.

859
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,260
With Lu Lingfeng's martial arts,

860
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,790
what are you worried about?

861
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:55,699
Let's go.

862
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,720
[Yunding Immortal Steps]

863
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,210
If you know what's good for you,

864
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,430
release all the mute slaves immediately.

865
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,610
Otherwise, Yunding Immortal Steps

866
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,660
will be destroyed

867
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,350
today.

868
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,470
You're so arrogant.

869
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,670
Yulang,

870
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,030
take the mute slaves away first.

871
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,860
Don't think I don't know who you are,

872
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,110
Lu Lingfeng, the sheriff of Yunding County.

873
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,440
You violated the agreement

874
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,470
and came to Yunding Immortal Steps to cause trouble.

875
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,910
How dare you!

876
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,750
So you recognized me.

877
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,700
Then I won't wear this

878
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,760
damn mask anymore.

879
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,680
And who are you?

880
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,870
Don't hide in the dark like a coward.

881
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,630
Come out

882
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,710
and let me see your true face!

883
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,430
If you want to see me,

884
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,160
you need to ask

885
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,060
the Thirteen Lethal Guardians of Yunding Immortal Steps

886
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,190
if they agree or not.

887
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,830
Pal,

888
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,980
let's join forces

889
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,970
to capture their leader.

890
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,570
I was just thinking the same.

891
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,950
A sneak attack with an arrow!

892
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,280
Who do you think you are?

893
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,620
The arrow is poisoned.

894
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:56,990
Go,

895
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,140
hurry!

896
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,430
Don't let him get away!

897
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,270
Go!

898
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,790
This poison is so potent.

899
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,410
I'm afraid I can't make it.

900
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,190
Thank you for saving my life, pal.

901
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,730
I, Lu Lingfeng,

902
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,350
won't be able to repay you in this life.

903
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,530
What nonsense are you talking about?

904
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,950
Sima Liang?

905
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,560
Sheriff Lu, Sheriff Lu!

906
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,220
Sheriff Lu!

907
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,410
It's a bit pungent.

908
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,810
Another hour of breathing this in

909
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,130
should detoxify the poison in your body.

910
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,820
You know medicine?

911
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,950
I know a thing or two.

912
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,240
I heard Suo Long mention before

913
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,750
that you have the skills of a coroner.

914
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,360
Twelve years as a sheriff, you pick up a few things.

915
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,770
Why did you save me?

916
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,940
Because you shouldn't die.

917
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,480
You're from the Lu family of Fanyang.

918
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,130
I thought you only got your position through family connections,

919
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,250
without any real talent or knowledge.

920
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,430
I didn't expect you to be skilled in both civil and martial arts.

921
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,070
Why did you save me?

922
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,320
Hasn't the Yunding Immortal Steps

923
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,400
always been

924
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,760
under your protection?

925
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,680
Protection?

926
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,900
I've wanted to destroy it for a long time.
