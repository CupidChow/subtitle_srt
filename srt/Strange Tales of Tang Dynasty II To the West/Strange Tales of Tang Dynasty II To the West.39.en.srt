Guys, as you expected,

6
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,550
after I used some tricks,

7
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,140
the patriarch of the Cao family

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,270
all confessed.

12
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,790
Please tell us the details.

13
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,110
The patriarch

14
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,410
was down and out.

17
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,950
went to him.

18
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,910
Sir,

19
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,520
today,

20
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,170
I'm here to beg you.

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,980
The 60th birthday funeral of Zhongda is approaching.

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,590
If you want to beg me to make an exception,

23
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,950
say no more.

24
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,510
This rule has existed for a few hundred years.

25
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,510
We can't break it.

26
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,010
I didn't come to you because of my father.

27
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,270
Then what is it?

28
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,190
Usually, when you met your elders,

29
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,870
you wouldn't even greet them.

30
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,470
But now, you are here

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,329
to beg me.

32
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,670
As you know,

33
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,990
my family has a lot of properties.

34
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,310
But we are

35
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,050
really short-handed.

36
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,730
We have a prosperous shop in the west of the city.

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,760
It's been rented by an outsider.

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,190
So the money earned naturally

39
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,390
goes to the outsider.

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,750
What a pity.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,829
You are

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,690
in the prime of life.

43
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,600
You are of good character

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,930
and have a wide network.

45
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,550
If you run the shop,

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,100
you can earn a lot of money every day.

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,040
I can't afford the rent.

48
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,000
Who asked you to rent it?

49
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,280
I'll

50
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,460
just...

51
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,040
give the shop to you.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,470
What?

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,380
But you have to give 20%

54
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,680
of the profit you make to the pawnshop.

55
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,710
Your descendants

56
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,579
can inherit this business.

57
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,170
But they also have to give

58
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,370
20% of the profit.

59
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,590
My conditions

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,780
are stringent enough, right?

61
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,150
If so, I'll

62
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,270
take great advantage of your family.

63
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,070
We both have a family name of Cao.

64
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,670
We're one.

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,470
The money I borrowed from the pawnshop

66
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,829
is not due yet.

67
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,590
Xiao,

68
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,710
you're not going to ask me to pay back the money in advance, are you?

69
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,910
Did you borrow money?

70
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,360
I don't think so.

71
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,829
Here's the thing.

72
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,190
A few days ago, the pawnshop caught fire.

73
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,840
The ledger was burnt to ashes.

74
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,970
Without the ledger,

75
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,310
I can't clearly remember

76
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,510
the loans in the past.

77
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,510
The shopkeeper told me

78
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,510
the money you borrowed is about to be due.

79
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,680
But I just couldn't

80
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,570
remember this.

81
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,420
So I came to you to verify it.

82
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,200
Well...

83
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,400
I don't deserve any reward.

84
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,600
You've always taken care of my family.

85
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,800
Last year, the pawnshop didn't do well.

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,270
So we borrowed two gold coins from you.

87
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,230
I'm really sorry

88
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,910
that I didn't pay them back to you earlier.

89
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,110
I invited you here today

90
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,570

91
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,560
to discuss the interest

92
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,600
with you.

93
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,430
When did I lend gold coins to your family?

94
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,830
You're very forgetful.

95
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,190
You've helped us a lot.

96
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,820
Let's just...

97
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,120
forget about the interest, okay?

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,540
Then...

99
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,680

and the three supervisors echoed his suggestion.

131
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,270
They made new rules on the Dragon Boat Festival

Duobao's death

with Cao Zhongda and Cao Xiao.

138
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,990
What is on your mind?

139
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,590
I'm just thinking

140
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,230
if Cao Zhongda

141
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,240
asked Cao Xiao to do those things.

142
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,360
If we were not officials,

143
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,510
what would you want?

144
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,670
I would hope

145
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,430
Cao Zhongda knows nothing

146
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,070
and Cao Xiao acted on her own.

147
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,909
This case seems simple,

148
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,680
but it's not that simple.

149
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,590
We don't know

150
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,659
if Cao Xiao knows

151
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,420
about Duobao's background

152
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,730
or how much Mr. Cao knows about it.

153
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,260
So we can't act hastily

154
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,610
or jump to conclusions.

You're right.

I still couldn't forget its flavor after I went back.

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,650
Well...

194
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,590
This puts me in an awkward situation.

195
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,960
You don't need to feel that way.

196
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,280
Just add more raisins

197
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,910
for me.

198
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,909
If your boss asks,

199
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,960
just tell him

200
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,340
you took the money,

201
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,909
but I didn't suffer losses.

202
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,570
No problem.

203
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,150
He bought two portions of ice cream?

204
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,059
Are you sure?

205
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,909
Yes.

206
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,400
He did buy two portions.

207
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,560
My lords,

208
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,850
I want to gossip about something.

209
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,670
I went to congratulate Mr. Cao on his birthday today,

210
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,510
but I saw Cao's Mansion has been sealed.

211
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,370
What happened?

212
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,710
Since you know you're gossipy,

213
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,310
don't ask.

214
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,950
Mr. He.

215
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,140
Focus on your business.

216
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,630
This ice cream

217
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,270
really is delicious.

218
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Maybe in 1,000 years,

219
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,070
it will become a delicacy

220
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,150
that everyone in this country likes.

221
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,840
Make me six more portions.

222
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,430
To go.

223
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,390
Okay.

224
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,470
Ice cream?

225
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,350
For me?

226
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,130
It's hot today.

227
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,200
It's for you to cool you off.

228
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,590
I can't believe

229
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,790
you're treating me, a prisoner, so well.

230
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,790
Mr. Cao,

231
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,160
this is Qiande Hall,

232
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,310
where you entertain guests.

233
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,410
This is your place.

234
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,080
I just asked you

235
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,470
to stay here alone for a few days.

236
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,530
Why did you call yourself a prisoner?

237
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm a 60-year-old man

238
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,530
who should have died.

239
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,510
No need to say that to comfort me.

240
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,470
Please.

241
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,020
Ice cream is a good thing.

242
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,550
It melts quickly.

243
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,280
So I

244
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,650
should eat it as soon as possible.

245
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,060
Ice cream is my son's favorite.

246
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,870
Can I

247
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,620
deliver this bowl to him?

248
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,040
I know Duobao

249
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,510
is in Qiande Hall now.

250
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,910
But the constables at the door

251
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,240
wouldn't let me see him.

252
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,270
Since you're his mother,

253
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,990
I'll take you there.

254
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,150
My son.

255
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,800
This is all my fault.

256
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,640
I was greedy for wealth.

257
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,580
I made you live in the Cao family

258
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,880
and become their eyesore.

259
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,670
Who do you think in the Cao family

260
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,930
hates Duobao the most?

261
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,510
Cao Rong and her husband,

262
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,510
the murderers!

263
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,390
Anyone else?

264
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,910
Cao Xiao.

265
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,880
She respects you very much.

266
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,510
She wouldn't even

267
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,790
speak ill of you.

268
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,610
Why do you think she hates Duobao?

269
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,310
I was too greedy.

270
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,150
I thought the Cao Family Cave is magnificent.

271
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,710
So I wanted Ding Mao to be a provider too.

272
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,970
Cao Zhongda agreed immediately.

273
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,630
But since then,

274
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,420
it feels like Cao Xiao

275
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,100
has treated me differently.

276
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,470
I always feel

277
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,820
she's been watching me.

278
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,710
That day,

279
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,750
after Ding Mao found out about Cao Zhongda's will,

280
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,540
he asked me to go to his room.

281
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,830
50% for Duobao

282
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,650
and 10% for you.

283
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,890
60% of the Cao family's assets

284
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,020
will be ours soon.

285
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,860
Our waiting

286
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,080
for the past 12 years is not in vain.

287
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,080
Who's there?

288
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,230
I didn't clearly see

289
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,470
who eavesdropped,

290
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,910
but I think

291
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,960
it must be Cao Xiao.

292
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,370
That girl is very cunning.

293
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,720
She seems to respect me

294
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,270
and be close to Duobao.

295
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,390
In fact,

296
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,260
she's always been on guard

297
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,460
against me and my son.

298
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,550
I don't eat ice cream.

299
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,910
You don't like it?

300
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,980
I ate it once last year.

301
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,290
Then I had diarrhoea.

302
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,710
So my mother wouldn't let me eat it anymore.

303
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,790
Sister,

304
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,630
you eat.

305
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,420
The ice cream won't taste good

306
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,360
if it melts.

307
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,750
You're such a sensible kid.

308
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,950
Actually, ice cream

309
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,830
is my uncle's favorite.

310
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,720
He even wrote the methods of making ice cream

311
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,670
in his red-covered book.

312
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,510
Who is the closest

313
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,060
to your uncle in the family?

314
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,590
Me.

315
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,500
And Aunt Xiao.

316
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,720
But she seems to have bickered

317
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,790
with him recently.

318
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,140
I saw her stare at him secretly

319
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,290
many times.

320
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,240
She looked very fierce.

321
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,390
It's almost melting.

322
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,030
You're a bad boy.

323
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,270
I came all the way

324
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,470
to deliver ice cream to you.

325
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,530
I can't believe you said I'm a bad boy.

326
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,470
Are you angry?

327
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,030
Boy,

328
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,610
you don't understand.

329
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,790
Bad

330
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,550
doesn't necessarily

331
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,030
mean evil.

332
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,360
Take Fan, that old man, as an example.

333
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,550
When he was pursuing me,

334
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,150
I always said he was a bad guy.

335
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,710
You're shy?

336
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,110
Then you must like me.

337
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,950
Take me with you.

338
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,390
I'll be nice to you forever.

339
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,400
I don't want to die here.

340
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,630
I want to live longer.

341
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,350
Take me with you.

342
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,080
How dare you!

343
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,470
Let me ask you.

344
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,190
In this family,

345
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,360
who treated Duobao the best

346
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,350
and who treated him the worst?

347
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,670
His mother treated him the best.

348
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,410
My father treated him the worst.

349
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,640
Are you saying Cao Zhongda

350
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,770
treated Duobao badly?

351
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,070
Of course.

352
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,110
He treated us, his three daughters, much better.

353
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,090
Duobao said he didn't want to do business.

354
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,000
He always said

355
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,310
he wanted to become a broker.

356
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,370
So my father almost beat him to death.

357
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,730
Stop.

358
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,670
-No.
-Father.

359
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,340
-Stop, Father.
-No!

360
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:21,970
Father.

361
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,350
I...

362
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,870
Get out of my way, Ding Mao!

363
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,070
Mr. Cao,

364
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,170
please don't be angry.

365
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,660
If you beat him this hard,

366
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,310
you'll beat him to death.

367
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,710
I'm disciplining my son.

368
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,430
Get out of my way!

369
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,830
Move!

370
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,820
Please.

371
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,620
At that time, I thought

372
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,150
I was very lucky

373
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,430
to be his daughter.

374
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,270
To be honest,

375
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,590
it's good enough

376
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,150
that I can get 10% of the family assets.

377
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,790
If I'm not greedy,

378
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,630
the assets are enough

379
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,020
for me to spend for the rest of my life.

380
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,470
Why have you stopped eating?

381
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,070
It's cold.

382
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,720
No matter how delicious it is, I can't eat too much.

383
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,110
Yes.

384
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,590
There is something I don't understand.

385
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,390
Could you please enlighten me?

386
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,400
Go ahead.

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,790
Since you have caught the murderer,

388
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,450
why did you ask my whole family

389
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,840
to live in Qiande Hall?

390
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,660
My daughter, Saisai, is still a little girl.

391
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,750
But she was forced to separate from her mother.

392
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,210
Who came up with this idea?

393
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,630
My husband, Li Chi,

394
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,990
was just thoughtless at that time.

395
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,390
He didn't commit murder.

396
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,390
Under which rule

397
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,530
did the state government

398
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,530
put him in prison?

399
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,110
And...

400
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,450
You still won't eat it?

401
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,079
I like ice cream with more raisins.

402
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,270
This kind of ordinary ice cream

403
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,579
is not delicious.

404
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,150
More raisins?

405
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,410
Last night, Duobao brought two portions of ice cream

406
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,869
with more raisins home.

407
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,190
One portion

408
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,230
was for me.

409
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,430
Duobao knew best what I like.

410
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,970
I enjoyed the ice cream

411
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,430
very much.

412
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,430
Who is it?

413
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,270
Sister Xiao,

414
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,640
can I come in?

415
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,830
Come in.

416
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,080
Sister Xiao.

417
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,950
I brought you ice cream.

418
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,090
Who wants it?

419
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:05,960
Take it away.

420
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,790
You've always been mean to me recently.

421
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,030
Did I do something to make you angry?

422
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,540
I know our father's 60th birthday funeral is approaching.

423
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,970
You are sad.

424
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,830
I feel sad too.

425
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,030
But we should get over it

426
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,650
and look to the future.

427
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,920
Have some ice cream now.

428
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,520
I asked them to add more raisins.

429
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,710
I know you like it.

430
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
One is not enough.

431
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,690
I want both of them.

432
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,860
Then I'll put both of them here.

433
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,310
Eat them as soon as possible.

434
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,440
Don't let them melt.

435
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,160
Duobao was a good kid.

436
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,640
But he...

437
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,440
You were an important official in Chang'an

438
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,080
and investigated countless mysterious cases.

439
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,340
You must have found out

440
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,570
Duobao's background, right?

441
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,570
It's a disgrace to our family.

442
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,610
I'm not going to repeat it.

443
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,490
I bribed the patriarch

444
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,110
and the members of the Family Supervisory Committee.

445
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,310
I prepared the poison

446
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,190
just to poison Duobao

447
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,360
on the Dragon Boat Festival

448
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,090
so that my father can live.

449
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,750
So

450
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,930
I caught up with Duobao

451
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,390
and told him

452
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,210
I couldn't finish two portions of ice cream

453
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,570
and I was just kidding.

454
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,570
Therefore,

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,640
after you found out

456
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,400
Fan Songling strangled Duobao to death,

457
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,230
I immediately took back

458
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,250
Duobao's body, put him in a coffin,

459
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,110
and buried him.

460
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,340
That was because I didn't want you

461
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,070
to continue to investigate it.

462
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,910
I did everything on my own.

463
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,500
I violated the Cao family's rules.

464
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,950
I'm too ashamed to face my father.

465
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,950
Execute me!

466
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,270
Ice cream really is a good thing.

467
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,070
I just hope ice cream

468
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,240
can be remembered by tourists

469
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,350
so that they'll come to Shazhou again.

470
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,790
Only the prosperity of trade and travel

471
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,200
can make Shazhou flourishing.

472
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,310
Then the people

473
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,910
can live better lives.

474
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,680
Unfortunately,

475
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,340
my time has come.

476
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,170
I can't make it to that day.

477
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,760
Mr. Cao,

478
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,390
you're no longer restricted

479
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,960
by the Family Supervisory Committee's rules.

480
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,820
Why did you say your time has come?

481
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,310
Fate has the final say.

482
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,070
I tried so hard

483
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,030
to avoid my 60th birthday funeral.

484
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,310
But unexpectedly,

485
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,190
Detective Di's disciple came to Shazhou.

486
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,070
Alright.

487
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,440
You let me

488
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,670
plead guilty in Qiande Hall.

489
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,460
You've protected my dignity well enough.

490
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,670
Plead guilty?

491
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,870
Yes.

492
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,470
I

493
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,190
didn't want to die.

494
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,480
I poisoned Duobao in order to survive.

495
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,360
I committed a heinous crime.

496
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,710
It's against ethics.

497
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,070
I'm too ashamed to face my family

498
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,790
or the people of Shazhou.

499
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,470
I wish to die as soon as possible.

500
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,670
Please grant my wish.

501
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,970
[Qiande Hall]

502
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,870
Mr. Cao and Cao Xiao pled guilty at the same time.

503
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,800
We found red aconite

504
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,550
in Cao Xiao's room.

505
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,830
But Mr. Cao doesn't have the poison.

506
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,800
Who said he doesn't have it?

507
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,350
The poison in Duobao's body

508
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,830
is a kind of aconite.

509
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,320
It's commonly known as...

510
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,510
"Red Neck".

511
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,090
Are you surprised?

512
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,830
I poisoned him myself.

513
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,750
Of course I know what it is.

514
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,950
Mr. Cao,

515
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,850
we have found this poison

516
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,200
in Cao Xiao's room.

517
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,630
Does it necessarily mean she poisoned him?

518
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,650
Listen.

519
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,950
Xiao is a kind girl.

520
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,310
She and Duobao were the closest.

521
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,270
It's impossible that she poisoned him.

522
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,330
Xiao is benevolent,

523
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,030
filial,

524
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,400
and very smart.

525
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,070
She's very good at doing business.

526
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,590
Although she is a girl,

527
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,270
she is outstanding

528
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,950
among the descendants of the Cao family.

529
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,500
She is also the future and hope of Tang.

530
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,260
I also know

531
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,960
your master, Detective Di,

532
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,160
was very good at solving cases.

533
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,030
But he loved the people more.

534
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,430
If you suspect Xiao,

535
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,050
you'll be disrespectful to your master.

536
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,510
Wait a minute.

537
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,830
Guys, step aside.

538
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,950
Let me take a look.

539
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,150
It's really Red Neck.

540
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,910
Both of them claimed to be the murderer.

541
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,470
Did they conspire with each other?

542
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,070
-No.
-No.

543
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,160
You go ahead.

544
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,770
If they conspired,

545
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,550
they would have discussed in advance.

546
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,630
After poisoning him,

547
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,360
they should have destroyed the evidence immediately.

548
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,070
They wouldn't have let us

549
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,930
find these two packets of poison.

550
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,320
If they didn't conspire,

551
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,850
who is the murderer?

552
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,430
How about this?

553
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,910
If you think Mr. Cao is the murderer,

554
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,570
stand here.

555
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,750
If you think Cao Xiao is the murderer,

556
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,750
stand over there.

557
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,630
Good idea.

558
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:21,910
You two,

559
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,990
choose your side.

560
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,170
I haven't decided yet.

561
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,150
Me neither.

562
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,840
How about this?

563
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,500
You guys tell us your own reasons first.

564
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,550
Xijun,

565
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,760
you first.

566
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,640
Cao Xiao has the poison.

567
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,190
The motive

568
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,230
and the timing of the murder

569
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,070
both match up.

570
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,720
We also found plants

571
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,870
used as decorations

572
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,720
for ice cream in her room.

573
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,650
It shows

574
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,440
her confession is true.

575
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,000
Xijun is sober-minded

576
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,230
and meticulous.

577
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,740
I don't think so.

578
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,520
When I entered Shazhou,

579
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,560
I thought Mr. Cao was a kind person.

580
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,520
So I wanted to befriend him.

581
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,030
From last night's banquet

582
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,310
to Duobao's death today,

583
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,350
everything Mr. Cao said

584
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,670
and did

585
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,570
shows he is a loving father

586
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,350
and a kind man.

587
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,650
There was nothing suspicious.

588
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,430
So,

589
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,310
I suspect Mr. Cao.

590
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,040
Don't give me that look.

591
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,390
This is a strange case.

592
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,990
So we have to think the other way around.

593
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,780
Look.

594
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,070
When the three supervisors

595
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,800
just arrived at Cao's Mansion,

596
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,790
Mr. Cao looked like he didn't know

597
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,790
the rules of the 60th birthday funeral

598
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,120
had been changed at all.

599
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,570
His acting was so convincing.

600
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,530
Why do you think he was acting?

601
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,590
Cao Xiao

602
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,680
is young.

603
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,800
She needed a lot of money

604
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,870
to bribe them.

605
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,250
I don't believe

606
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,630
Mr. Cao doesn't know it at all.

607
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,260
Besides,

608
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,510
every person

609
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,710
I thought to be good at first

610
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,580
would always end up...

611
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,890
Anyway, I think Cao Zhongda is the murderer.

612
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,830
Fed's speculation based on his intuition

613
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,470
is reasonable too.

614
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,560
Xue Huan,

615
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,300
why do you think Mr. Cao is the murderer?

616
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,800
Duobao was the only son of the Cao family,

617
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,460
but was not favored by Mr. Cao.

618
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,510
Mr. Cao loves

619
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,430
his three elder sisters more than him.

620
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,070
Also, even Cao Rong,

621
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,150
who has been good-for-nothing since she was little,

622
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,550
thinks her father treats her

623
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,680
better than Duobao.

624
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,070
So I think

625
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,630
Mr. Cao knew

626
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,830
Duobao is not his biological son

627
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,990
from the beginning.

628
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,570
He also faked his will,

629
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,310
in which he said he would give Duobao

630
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,710
50% of the family assets.

631
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,690
Because he knew

632
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,550
Duobao would be killed on the Dragon Boat Festival.

633
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,480
And the murderer

634
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,070
is himself.

635
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,670
A strict master brings up accomplished disciples.

636
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,070
Xue Huan's analysis

637
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,530
is also clear and logical.

638
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:10,800
Yingtao,

639
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,770
it's your turn.

640
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,830
Cao Xiao is in charge of the pawnshop

641
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,150
at such a young age.

642
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,970
This shows Cao Zhongda trusts her very much.

643
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,350
She is the most filial in the Cao family

644
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,800
and has been widely praised by the people of Shazhou.

645
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,470
Since Ding Mao

646
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,190
was drawn in the Cao Family Cave

647
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,630
as the tenth provider,

648
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,650
she had been following Ye Lai.

649
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,230
I think she confirmed

650
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,750
Duobao is not a descendant of the Cao family long ago.

651
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,750
She wanted to save her father from the 60th birthday funeral.

652
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,010
She had a strong motive to commit murder.

653
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,770
Yingtao's analysis is also reasonable.

654
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,750
Indeed,

655
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,860
Cao Xiao is the biggest suspect.

656
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,110
Cao Xiao's birth mother has a headache.

657
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,110
She needs red aconite for her treatment.

658
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,830
Although Mr. Cao has this medicine,

659
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,230
it can't prove anything.

660
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,450
Most importantly,

661
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,930
Cao Duobao died between 9 and 11 p.m. last night.

662
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,350
At that time,

663
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,830
we were enjoying ourselves at the banquet.

664
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,750
He didn't have time to commit the crime.

665
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,680
You have a point.

666
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,060
He didn't have time to poison him.

667
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,990
No matter how reliable my intuition is,

668
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,990
it doesn't count.

669
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,870
Looks like Mr. Cao

670
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,330
wants to take the blame for his daughter.

671
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,720
Then he can still be considered a good person.

672
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,750
Right,

673
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,310
why don't we use this as an excuse

674
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,520
to ask Mr. Cao again?

675
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,710
Why didn't Zhang Huang come?

676
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,430
I just want to die as soon as possible. Is it that difficult?

677
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,900
Give Red Neck back to me.

678
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,190
Let me kill myself.

679
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,430
Mr. Cao,

680
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,470
I admire your character.

681
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,950
But this concerns human lives.

682
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,710
We must investigate it thoroughly.

683
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,030
Last night's banquet lasted all night long.

684
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,220
Cao Duobao died between 9 and 11 p.m. last night.

685
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,150
You didn't have time to poison him.

686
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,970
I didn't go anywhere during the banquet?

687
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,940
You did go somewhere during the banquet.

688
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,990
But the time was so short

689
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,880
that it was only enough for you to go to the toilet.

690
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,400
The time was not enough

691
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,960
for you to go back to your mansion,

692
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,190
poison him,

693
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,310
and come back to drink with us.

694
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,870
To prove this,

695
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,790
I tried it

696
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,790
just now.

697
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,390
Do you know

698
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,480
the backyard of Qiande Hall

699
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,820
is just a street away from my mansion?

700
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,090
Of course we know.

701
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,390
But you have to take a detour.

702
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,430
So you can't arrive at your mansion within a short time.

703
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,150
Really?

704
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,190
Then you have to run fast.

705
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,140
I'll wait for you in my mansion's courtyard.

706
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,990
The Disappearing Technique?

707
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,220
What is it?

708
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,310
There is no time for explaining.

709
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,240
Go after him now!

710
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,470
He...

711
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,460
What... What did you just say?

712
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,750
The Disappearing Technique.

713
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,190
When

714
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,790
we were interrogating Fan Songling,

715
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,720
he mentioned it.

716
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,990
He is best at sword dance.

717
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,530
I didn't know this before.

718
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,830
I really didn't expect this.

719
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,390
Mr. Cao,

720
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,870
you're already 60 years old.

721
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,640
But you are still so agile.

722
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,950
When I was young,

723
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,310
I didn't like doing business,

724
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,510
just like Duobao.

725
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,790
I didn't want to inherit the family business either.

726
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,270
My father chased me and beat me.

727
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,710
So I escaped from my home

728
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,950
and traveled around.

729
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,360
During those years,

730
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,050
I had fun in the Yangtze River

731
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,530
and looked for an immortal in the Zhongnan Mountain.

732
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,700
I was so happy.

733
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,580
Until one day, I met

734
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,170
a troupe doing sword dance in Dongdu.

735
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,510
All of them were good at sword dance.

736
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,160
There was an old man.

737
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,390
He had a 100-feet pole on his head.

738
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,470
The pole had five long strings,

739
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,350
which were strong enough

740
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,790
for five girls

741
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,030
to dance with halberds on the string.

742
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,610
There was also a remarkable woman.

743
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,440
She climbed up

744
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,800
ten beds

745
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,270
to stand in the sky.

746
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,390
With her arms and legs extended,

747
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,150
she spun in the sky with effortless grace,

748
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,150
as if she were walking on the ground.

749
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,830
Are you talking about

750
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,760
the Situ Troupe,

751
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,390
which was well-known at that time?

752
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:05,990
Exactly.

753
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,470
The leader has a family name of Situ.

754
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,460
The girl with the skill of climbing up beds

755
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,390
is his daughter.

756
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,990
She is also

757
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,750
the love of my life.

758
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,480
Just like that, I followed them

759
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,070
from Dongdu to Chang'an,

760
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,940
and from Chang'an to Fanyang.

761
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,400
I spent three years with them.

762
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,630
Later, I missed my hometown,

763
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,660
and my father turned 60.

764
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,350
So I returned to Shazhou.

765
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,830
Although I only learned a little

766
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,510
of the Disappearing Technique

767
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,480
during the three years,

768
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,310
it allows me to travel smoothly

769
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,270
between Qiande Hall

770
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,630
and my mansion.

771
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,190
When I left the banquet that night,

772
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,950
I told you I wanted to go to the toilet.

773
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,900
In fact,

774
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,670
I used the bamboo pole

775
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,550
to help me return to my mansion

776
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,790
through the back window.

777
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:14,940
Father.

778
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,430
Bao,

779
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,750
where did you go?

780
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,270
I went to deliver ice cream to Sister Xiao.

781
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,730
You came at the right time.

782
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,970
This portion of ice cream

783
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,910
is for you.

784
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,350
I asked them to add more raisins.

785
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,510
Father, don't be angry.

786
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,350
I didn't ask for this

787
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,950
from Mr. He's shop.

788
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,870
I made money to buy it myself.

789
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,910
Tomorrow is your birthday.

790
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,630
Consider this portion of ice cream

791
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,710
my gift for you.

792
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,390
Bao,

793
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,550
I already ate ice cream in Qiande Hall.

794
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,470
I'm old.

795
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,230
I dare not eat too much because I'm sensitive to the cold.

796
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,020
Keep it

797
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,180
and eat it yourself.

798
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,430
Yes, Father.

799
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,890
Thank you, Father.

800
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,270
I know Duobao was innocent.

801
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,949
But Ding Mao and Ye Lai

802
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,510
had an affair

803
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,469
and even wanted to take my assets.

804
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,290
How could I just sit by and watch?

805
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:21,920
Alright.

806
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,830
I've told you the truth.

807
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,070
Please tell Governor Zhang

808
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,280
to give me a quick death.

809
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,590
Although Xiao

810
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,190
bribed the Supervisory Committee

811
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,239
and changed the rules of the 60th birthday funeral,

812
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,500
she didn't poison him.

813
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,110
She's not guilty.

814
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,350
Right?

815
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,710
Cao Rong

816
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,540
is a silly girl.

817
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,310
Although she was instigated by Fan Songling,

818
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,430
she could never be involved in a murder.

819
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,030
Besides,

820
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,550
I poisoned him first.

821
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,840
They didn't strangle Duobao

822
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,990
to death.

823
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,270
Although they did something wrong,

824
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,550
it's my fault

825
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,810
because I didn't teach them well, right?

826
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,700
Please

827
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,430
show them leniency.

828
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,070
Okay?

829
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,970
Physician Fed.

830
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,660
I also want to ask you for a favor.

831
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,990
Li Chi

832
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,210
is from a poor family.

833
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,480
He studied hard for ten years before achieving success.

834
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,430
Although he married into the Cao family,

835
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,670
I've never taken him seriously.

836
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,310
I always bossed him around.

837
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,230
I only wanted

838
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,790
to give his family

839
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,390
10% of the assets.

840
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,620
Indeed, I was thoughtless.

841
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,910
It's understandable that he tried

842
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,950
to kill me under the influence of alcohol.

843
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,010
More importantly,

844
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,390
he didn't succeed, right?

845
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,270
Do me a favor.

846
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,350
Help me beg Governor Zhang

847
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,630
not to hold Li Chi accountable.

848
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,220
I made a big mistake

849
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,060
at the age of 60.

850
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,110
Ancestors,

851
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,370
please forgive me.

852
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,930
With his Disappearing Technique,

853
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,070
Mr. Cao can actually leap and fly

854
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,300
with the help of a pole at the age of 60.

855
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,670
This unique skill

856
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,630
really impressed me today.

857
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,910
I should learn it.

858
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,350
It can save my life, right?

859
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,110
This unique skill

860
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,710
has caused us a lot of trouble.

861
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,410
Mr. Cao didn't have time to commit the crime.

862
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,130
But now,

863
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,030
he's determined

864
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,510
to take the blame.

865
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,320
Now it's difficult to solve this case.

866
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,850
You don't believe

867
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,840
Cao Zhongda poisoned him?

868
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,570
Human nature is complicated,

869
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,430
but I'm

870
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,520
more inclined to believe Cao Xiao is the murderer.

871
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,350
If Cao Zhongda is not the murderer,

872
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,550
how did he know

873
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,010
it was the ice cream that poisoned Duobao

874
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,630
instead of something else

875
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,700
like water or tea?

876
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,870
At first,

877
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,030
I didn't suspect Mr. Cao.

878
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,400
But he accurately

879
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,230
identified the poisonous ice cream.

880
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,230
This alone

881
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,870
can't prove

882
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,070
Mr. Cao is the one who poisoned Duobao.

883
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,710
I think

884
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,110
it's more likely that he wants

885
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,770
to take the blame for Cao Xiao.

886
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,030
Although we know this,

887
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,080
there is nothing

888
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,790
we can do about it.

889
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,110
You and I are not officials of this city.

890
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
We came to Shazhou as guests.

891
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,340
Mr. Cao showed us warm hospitality.

892
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,370
But now he has become a murderer.

893
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,190
Since he's determined to plead guilty,

894
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,210
why don't we...

895
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,150
do him a favor?

896
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,080
What do you mean?

897
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,750
I've pled guilty.

898
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,510
Is it still necessary to interrogate me?

899
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,630
It's late. I'm going to sleep.

900
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,230
Get out.

901
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,510
The poisoner has confessed.

902
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,830
So you don't need to take the blame for him.

903
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,310
Leave.

904
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,780
This is not a prison.

905
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,200
No one can imprison

906
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,230
innocent people.

907
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,910
Go home.

908
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,670
The Cao family's business

909
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,590
depends on you in the future.

910
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,510
I told you

911
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,660
I poisoned him!

912
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,350
Cao Xiao!

913
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,950
This is a crime that will cost you your life.

914
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,870
You are still young.

915
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,430
Why are you acting tough?

916
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,290
Do you think you're being filial?

917
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,590
How can Mr. Cao

918
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,580
bear to live

919
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,440
after watching you

920
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,950
die for him?

921
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,230
Father.

922
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,550
Father.

923
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,910
I got you into trouble.

924
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,730
It's my fault.

925
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,180
What?

926
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,600
Did you and your father conspire with each other?

927
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,880
My father didn't know

928
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,790
about Duobao's background at all.

929
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,870
I told him

930
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,910
about my plan.

931
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,200
What did you say?

932
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,600
Foolish!

933
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,500
I've taught you

934
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,710
how to study,

935
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,950
how to be a righteous person,

936
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,700
and how to do business since you were little.

937
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,990
What have you learned?

938
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,250
My daughter

939
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,070
wants to kill someone.

940
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:12,900
Father,

941
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,270
I'm sorry.

942
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,970
But this matter...

943
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,570
Listen.

944
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,920
Just pretend

945
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,530
that you know nothing about this.

946
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,430
Just focus on your business.

947
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,900
Marry into a good family

948
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,270
and live a simple life in the future.

949
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,020
Remember,

950
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,270
you must do as many good deeds

951
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,350
as you can in this life.

952
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,680
Father is very kind.

953
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,350
But I just couldn't stand by

954
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,480
and let Ye Lai and Ding Mao's plot

955
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,510
succeed.

956
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,890
I couldn't bear to see my father

957
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,430
go to his 60th birthday funeral either.

958
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,710
So I decided

959
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,450
to do everything on my own.

960
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,510
But in the end...

961
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,670
Who is it?

962
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,020
Sister Xiao,

963
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,380
can I come in?

964
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,230
Come in.

965
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,350
I brought you ice cream.

966
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,190
Who wants it?

967
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:35,940
Take it away.

968
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,750
You've always been mean to me recently.

969
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,070
Did I do something to make you angry?

970
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,340
I know our father's 60th birthday funeral is approaching.

971
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,630
You are sad.

972
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,580
I feel sad too.

973
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,800
But we should get over it

974
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,330
and look to the future.

975
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,600
Have some ice cream now.

976
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,470
I asked them to add more raisins.

977
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,550
I know you like it.

978
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,510
So,

979
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,170
you didn't poison him.

980
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,800
My father poisoned him,

981
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,520
but if it weren't for me,

982
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,420
he wouldn't have done that.

983
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,900
If my father is sentenced to death,

984
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,050
I will die with him.

985
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,080
Who told you it was Mr. Cao who poisoned Duobao?

986
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,310
My father didn't do it?

987
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,170
Then who did it?

988
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,700
Cao Xiao,

989
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,350
you think you are smart.

990
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,710
You're self-righteous.

991
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,310
You think

992
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,570
you are taking the blame for your father.

993
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,950
But you almost helped the real murderer

994
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,510
get away with it.
