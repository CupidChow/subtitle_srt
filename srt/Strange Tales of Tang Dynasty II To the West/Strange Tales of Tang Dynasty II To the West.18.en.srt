4
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,509
Mortals who stand in the Jade Emperor's way

5
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,270
must die!

6
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,550
Lu Lingfeng!

7
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,690
Go back to the cabin

8
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,280
Be careful not to get hurt.

9
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,270
You are

10
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,130
all here?

11
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,840
No one is going out to help?

12
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,220
The Jade Emperor

13
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
doesn't deserve our attention.

14
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,070
You really have a short temper.

15
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,950
After it's done,

16
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,950
Sheriff Lu will call for us himself.

17
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,620
Imperial Censor.

18
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,500
Come.

19
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,280
Come over and drink some water.

20
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:42,700
Here

21
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,470
This

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,990
Rest assured,

23
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,070
it's alright.

24
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,079
Alright,

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,550
come on out.

26
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,750
That was too fast.

27
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,370
I haven't even finished drinking the water.

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,530
If I had known you were a madman,

29
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,350
Lu Lingfeng shouldn't have rescued you

30
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,420
from the net.

31
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,760
If it weren't for me,

32
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,070
the boat would have capsized long ago.

33
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,900
You would all be buried at the bottom of the river.

34
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,390
He...

35
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,390
Censor Xie,

36
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,280
how do you think this man should be dealt with?

37
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,150
Mr. Su,

38
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:26,910
Mr. Lu,

39
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,630
you two are well-known in the capital.

40
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,750
I'll leave it entirely up to you.

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,550
That won't do.

42
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,430
I am

43
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,390
nothing but a commoner in plain clothes now.

44
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,720
I am also just the sheriff of Yunding County.

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,150
I cannot handle cases across borders while on my way to take office.

46
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,390
While on the river, this man

47
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,710
attempted to seize the boat and commit murder.

48
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,930
It's up to you to decide

49
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,460
how he should be dealt with.

50
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,690
When the boat reaches the shore,

51
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,260
send him to the local authorities.

52
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,750
He will receive a death sentence.

53
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,750
It's just that...

54
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,550
What was that thing just now?

55
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,480
Su Wuming,

56
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,590
She's asking you.

57
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,130
I've never seen it before either.

58
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,150
According to legend,

59
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,530
there are 'Four Oddities' on land.

60
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,790
In the water, there is a ferocious beast

61
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,390
called the 'Five Oddities'.

62
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,630
Its claws are like those of a giant crab,

63
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,270
and it has tentacles.

64
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,610
It's a water creature.

65
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,110
Why does it have wings?

66
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,190
It has a scorpion-like tail.

67
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,230
A pozhe!

68
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,710
Shark head, scorpion tail, crab claws,

69
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,130
octopus tentacles,

70
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,590
and bat wings.

71
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,010
I remember now.

72
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,110
This is the 'Five Oddities' recorded in the books,

73
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,870
A pozhe!

74
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,580
What's the point of remembering

75
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,350
its name now?

76
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,140
It's going to eat people!

77
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,830
Save him!

78
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,310
There's meat in the cargo hold.

79
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,240
Let's bring it up to feed the beast!

80
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,990
Okay!

81
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,190
Okay.

82
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,550
Okay.

83
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,390
Donkey meat?

84
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,830
He slaughtered my donkey!

85
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,030
They must have slaughtered the donkey

86
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,090
to feed that thing.

87
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,910
Hurry up

88
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,330
Damn it!

89
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,110
Help me!

90
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,350
Help me

91
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,280
The small dock up ahead

92
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,110
is abandoned.

93
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,360
According to the map,

94
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,310
[Qianchong Dock Dock Front]

95
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,860
it's still more than 13 miles away from

96
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,470
Qianchong Dock.

97
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,710
I need to find the nearest

98
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,040
dock to cross the river.

99
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,070
I can't delay my journey to take up

100
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,750
the post in the West any longer.

101
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,550
The first one they wanted to kill

102
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,680
was you,

103
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,870
the Imperial Censor in a hurry to patrol the border.

104
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,390
Yes.

105
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,230
Have you forgotten

106
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,230
what that old ferryman told us?

107
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,510
Every day, people who board the boat

108
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,870
need to be registered

109
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,130
and kept on file.

110
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,240
[Qianchong Dock]

111
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,690
You just need to write down your name,

112
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,280
official position,

113
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,260
and occupation.

114
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,560
He was just trying to confirm

115
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,680
your identity as the Imperial Censor.

116
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,480
That's right.

117
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,920
We should have been

118
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,960
safe and sound.

119
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,760
It's all because of that

120
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,050
Imperial Censor

121
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,640
that we almost lost our lives in the river.

122
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,260
By the way,

123
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,390
I heard you say

124
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,430
the previous two Imperial Censor

125
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,230
both failed to arrive at their posts as scheduled.

126
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,560
Could it be that...

127
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,790
What else could it be?

128
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,960
I'm pretty sure

129
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,390
they were buried in the river

130
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,190
while crossing Qianchong Dock.

131
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,230
Well...

132
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,670
Seriously speaking,

133
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,510
this is a matter of life and death.

134
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,720
But we can't delay

135
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,680
his journey to the West any longer.

136
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,120
It's just that their behavior

137
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,980
is too strange.

138
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,750
For example, the boat doesn't transport horses,

139
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,150
but the price they pay for buying the horses

140
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,480
is not very low either.

141
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
What do they need so many horses for?

142
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,670
Censor Xie is eager to go west

143
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,250
to make a name for himself.

144
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,260
Talking so much is useless.

145
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,470
Not so.

146
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,030
Since there are many suspicious points,

147
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,430
how can we overlook them?

148
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,550
Very well then.

149
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,630
It's just that if we want to catch this gang of bandits

150
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,720
in one fell swoop,

151
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,710
I'm afraid the few of us alone

152
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,190
will need to borrow some troops.

153
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,050
Borrow troops?

154
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,120
Censor, please take a look.

155
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,470
If we disembark here,

156
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,990
it's less than 7 miles

157
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,870
to this river outpost fortress.

158
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,330
Please go there in person,

159
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,230
and borrow some soldiers from the fortress officer.

160
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,160
For this matter,

161
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,280
it won't work if someone else goes.

162
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,430
But

163
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,810
we have to cover the distance on foot.

164
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,510
How much time will that take?

165
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,390
Moreover,

166
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,720
it's almost dawn.

167
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,820
If that gang of bandits

168
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,990
searches the river

169
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,550
and cannot find the boat,

170
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,000
they will definitely become suspicious.

171
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,360
Censor Xie is right.

172
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,350
The most pressing matter

173
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,810
is that we need to act fast.

174
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,550
I can do it.

175
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,350
It's only 7 miles.

176
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,510
I can make a round-trip

177
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,170
without taking too much time.

178
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,270
I

179
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,750
I'm not trying to run away.

180
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,160
My life

181
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,320
was saved by you all.

182
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,490
There are no immortals in this world,

183
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,440
only you gentlemen with hearts of immortals.

184
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,550
Have you come to your senses, Yu Di?

185
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,760
When I was hanging on the side of that boat,

186
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,870
I felt like I had already experienced

187
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,270
a cycle of life and death.

188
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,800
The previous delusions

189
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,350
were all due to the many misfortunes in my youth,

190
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,410
narrowly escaping death many times.

191
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,770
Now, I regret my past actions.

192
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,350
Unfortunately, even if you make this trip.

193
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,510
the fortress officer

194
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,640
may not believe you.

195
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,110
Of course I know that.

196
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,280
I can carry Censor Xie on my back.

197
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,910
Carry

198
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,790
Can you still run

199
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,990
with him on your back?

200
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,070
Why not

201
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,030
When I trained my leg strength in the mountains,

202
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,830
I carried boulders weighing over a hundred catty.

203
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,310
Mr. Xie.

204
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,470
Do you still trust this man?

205
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,630
My ancestors

206
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,470
made great contributions to the country.

207
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,630
The ones who were blessed

208
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,830
were none other than the common people.

209
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,720
After going through this ordeal,

210
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,390
Yu Di

211
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,840
should have turned over a new leaf.

212
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,510
I

213
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,910
trust him

214
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,590
Old Boat Officer!

215
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,590
Old Boat Officer!

216
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,120
What are you yelling about?

217
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,790
It's back!

218
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,190
The boat is back!

219
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,290
Father,

220
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,460
I haven't even sent anyone to look for the boat yet.

221
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,630
Neither have I.

222
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,910
Who is sailing the boat here?

223
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,040
I don't know.

224
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,590
But,

225
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,540
someone seems to be standing at the bow of the boat.

226
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,110
Although the old ferryman is old,

227
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,970
his eyes

228
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,490
are as sharp as a hawk's.

229
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,650
That's right.

230
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,960
He doesn't look like a good person.

231
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,460
Today,

232
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,950
they got five horses

233
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,910
without breaking a sweat.

234
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,110
If this continues day after day,

235
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,970
how many horses

236
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,440
will they get?

237
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,310
A rebellion!

238
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,550
Sheriff Lu, what do you think?

239
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,430
For the safety of the country,

240
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,230
I must return to Qianchong Dock.

241
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,490
[Qianchong Dock]

242
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,690
Father!

243
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,180
That guy is very strong.

244
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,910
The few of us

245
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,010
are no match for him

246
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,780
Fetch me my bow and arrows.

247
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,990
You're getting old,

248
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,350
your strength is not enough anymore.

249
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,950
Listen up, all of you.

250
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,030
I'm the newly appointed sheriff of Hanzhou's Yunding County,

251
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,690
Lu Lingfeng

252
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,110
Those who surrender and hand over their weapons

253
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,770
will be dealt with leniently.

254
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,170
Insolent brat!

255
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,660
Such arrogance!

256
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,370
Kill him

257
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,339
They really do have bows and arrows!

258
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:12,940
Su Wuming!

259
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,520
Don't tell me you guessed right again!

260
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,430
Put some more effort into it.

261
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,960
The direction is correct.

262
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,790
Soon

263
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,990
we'll be able to reach the shore.

264
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,110
Go!

265
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,370
Hang in there!

266
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,310
We'll reach the shore soon!

267
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,350
Let go of me

268
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,270
Brother.

269
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,250
Can we really

270
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,630
leave Lu Lingfeng alone

271
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,230
Yingtao.

272
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,470
Would you mind going up there

273
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,010
to help Lu Lingfeng?

274
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,290
Board the boat and catch them!

275
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,870
Where did you learn such martial arts skills?

276
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,930
That's too sloppy.

277
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,270
And you still want to be my brother?

278
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,400
Are you even worthy?

279
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,500
I'll stab you to death!

280
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,960
Old Boat Officer, look!

281
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,880
Arrest them all!

282
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,070
Yes.

283
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,090
[Qianchong Dock]

284
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,720
You're really impatient, Censor Xie.

285
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,360
Can't you leave after the interrogation?

286
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,630
Although I am the Imperial Censor of the border,

287
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,150
I cannot

288
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,950
interrogate criminals.

289
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,550
Mr. Su, Mr. Lu.

290
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,950
You're both sheriffs

291
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,600
and have served as the Supreme Court's Deputy President.

292
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,860
You are certainly experts in this field.

293
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,830
I wrote this myself.

294
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,190
As the Imperial Censor of the border appointed by the court,

295
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,650
I authorize Mr. Lu to investigate this case.

296
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,790
After going through this ordeal,

297
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,050
I now realize that the journey to the west

298
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,900
is full of countless dangers.

299
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,190
Perhaps the road ahead

300
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,990
is filled with

301
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,720
all kinds of unexpected things

302
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,350
and even bizarre cases.

303
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
With this letter,

304
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,830
you can act according to the circumstances

305
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,030
to solve mysterious cases

306
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,960
and kill bandits

307
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,290
all the way to Yunding.

308
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:20,950
Xie,

309
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,510
do you have the authority to do this?

310
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,920
Well, I actually do.

311
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,960
However,

312
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,560
I have to use my life

313
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,450
as a guarantee.

314
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,830
Mr. Lu is from the Lu family of Fanyang

315
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,600
and is a fellow disciple of Detective Di along with Mr. Su.

316
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
He can be trusted.

317
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,890
I am willing to vouch for him with my life.

318
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,100
Thank you very much, Censor Xie.

319
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,590
Mr. Xie.

320
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,560
You really want to take Yu Di with you?

321
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,150
Yes, I do.

322
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,110
We settled it

323
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,110
on our way to get the troops.

324
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,570
Aren't you afraid he will

325
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,950
kill you?

326
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,170
No, I'm not.

327
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,510
Yu Di's obsession is gone.

328
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,120
You sound so confident.

329
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,760
Otherwise

330
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,860
he could have abandoned me

331
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,030
on our way to borrow the troops

332
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,360
and run away by himself.

333
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,560
That makes sense.

334
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,310
This man

335
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,310
is an extraordinary person.

336
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,670
He can run faster than a horse.

337
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,910
In this westward journey,

338
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,020
he will lead my horse to make amends for his crimes.

339
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,750
In the future

340
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,010
when I establish my career and achieve success,

341
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,740
I will not mistreat him either.

342
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,070
That's wonderful.

343
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,190
You and Yu Di complement each other well.

344
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,430
How delightful

345
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,130
and how fortunate.

346
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,900
How dare you thieves.

347
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,070
On this list

348
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,490
a total of five Investigating Censors were recorded.

349
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,910
[Osmanthus Wine and Pepper Milk]

350
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,610
Were they

351
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,230
murdered by the likes of you?

352
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,590
Kill me if you want,

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,990
stop nagging.

354
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,670
In that case

355
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,010
I have no choice but to execute first and report later.

356
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,710
Come on

357
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,400
Father!

358
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,870
Wait!

359
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,790
Don't kill my son.

360
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,510
I'll confess.

361
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,170
Father...

362
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,780
I once committed a capital crime.

363
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,660
Fortunately, Duke Yan saved my life

364
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,190
and allowed me to atone for my crime through meritorious service.

365
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,050
However, while

366
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,030
Duke Yan fought for the imperial court

367
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,630
until he was sixty years old,

368
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,630
he was framed and imprisoned.

369
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,590
He died with grievances.

370
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,390
Do you know who

371
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,200
framed him for treason?

372
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,070
It was an Investigating Censor.

373
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,940
Such a minor official.

374
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,550
But with just a few words,

375
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,670
he put a loyal minister and good general to death.

376
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,500
How despicable!

377
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,310
You are a subordinate of Black Teeth Changzhi?

378
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,850
That's right!

379
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,200
Duke Yan indeed died unjustly.

380
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,550
Those who heard about it

381
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,750
all felt deep regret.

382
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,950
But that happened during the reign of Empress Wu.

383
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,790
The imperial court

384
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,810
has already redressed the injustice done to him.

385
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,550
Shut up!

386
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,270
If I kill you today

387
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,990
and redress the injustice for you tomorrow,

388
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,050
would that be fine?

389
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,740
Duke Yan met his demise

390
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,240
in the first year of Yongchang.

391
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,070
But the first time you

392
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,710
murdered an Investigating Censor

393
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,970
was during the reign of Emperor Gaozong.

394
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,760
You are talking nonsense here.

395
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,280
Are you trying to use Duke Yan's injustice

396
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,870
to lessen your own crime?

397
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,750
Do you know

398
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,930
why I committed a capital crime back then?

399
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,830
You murdered an Investigating Censor.

400
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,630
That's right.

401
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,030
So what?

402
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,970
My great-grandfather

403
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,110
was the boat officer of Qianchong Dock.

404
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,870
My grandfather

405
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,230
and my father were too.

406
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,950
It was all because

407
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,880
an Investigating Censor came,

408
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,800
and somehow

409
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,700
we didn't serve him well,

410
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,570
he submitted a memorial to the imperial court

411
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,230
to close down Qianchong Dock.

412
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,930
As a result,

413
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,530
my father could no longer be a boat officer.

414
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,390
In a fit of rage,

415
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,700
he killed that Imperial Censor.

416
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,750
He deserved it!

417
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,860
Did the Investigating Censor submit the memorial

418
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,420
to close Qianchong Dock down

419
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,910
because of the whirlpool?

420
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,770
So what if that was the case?

421
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,300
You, little girl,

422
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,550
how do you know about things that happened so long ago?

423
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,450
Do you all still remember

424
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,110
what he once said?

425
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,740
During the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui,

426
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,030
floods were rampant.

427
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,430
The river surface was at least three times wider

428
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,550
than during the Six Dynasties period.

429
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,150
The depth was immeasurable.

430
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,240
Sheriff Lu,

431
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,750
please take a look at this ancient painting

432
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,390
It should have been painted before the river flooded.

433
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,110
The whirlpool in the middle of the river

434
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,100
may have been caused

435
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,430
by these strange rocks.

436
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,180
Whirlpools in the water

437
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,680
come in many varieties.

438
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,200
In rivers and waterways,

439
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,190
they are most likely to appear at sharp bends.

440
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,800
If this painting records

441
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,430
the scenery before the river flooded,

442
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,600
then these strange rocks must be

443
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,790
at the bottom of the river by now.

444
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,470
Their presence

445
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,500
would block the path of the water flow.

446
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,660
The water forced to flow back

447
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,480
then encounters

448
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,520
the incoming water from behind,

449
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,030
rushing towards these strange rocks again.

450
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,150
But they get blocked again.

451
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,750
This way,

452
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,190
stuck advancing and retreating constantly,

453
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,260
the back-and-forth water flow

454
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,740
can only swirl in place,

455
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,550
forming a whirlpool.

456
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,310
Xijun,

457
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,230
you not only remember everything in the painting

458
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,360
after just a glance,

459
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,110
but can also perceive the way of the landscape.

460
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,990
It's truly admirable.

461
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,440
The whirlpool in the river is caused by the flooding.

462
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,040
But did you raise the massive

463
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,770
creature in the river?

464
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,590
So what if I did?

465
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,720
The first time I encountered it,

466
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,200
its body was no more than ten feet long.

467
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,520
That can't be right.

468
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,210
You encountered the fish my dad raised

469
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,470
and actually managed to come back alive?

470
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,550
In that case

471
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,370
the Investigating Censor who suggested

472
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,770
closing Qianchong Dock

473
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,090
truly had sharp discerning eyes.

474
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,110
It's a pity

475
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,910
that you killed him.

476
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,070
One sentence from him

477
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,830
affected my family.

478
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,750
I have no regrets about killing him.

479
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,650
Report!

480
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,290
Sheriff Lu,

481
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,490
we have found privately hidden horses

482
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,820
totaling 1,052 of them.

483
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,750
At the same time, 727 thieves were captured.

484
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,830
We confiscated thousands of

485
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,870
bows and arrows, swords, spears, and related weapons.

486
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,930
Here are the details, please review.

487
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,150
You!

488
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,590
What is this?

489
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,190
What organization do you belong to?

490
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,510
Under whose order

491
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,590
are you plotting a rebellion?

492
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,070
Stop trying to scare my dad!

493
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,430
My dad won't answer.

494
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,670
If you want to kill,

495
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,820
then kill me.

496
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,630
Sect Leader will avenge us.

497
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,560
Sect Leader?

498
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,680
[Tongtian Rhino]

499
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,660
My ass hurts.

500
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,090
No matter how fast this horse is

501
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,670
it's still not as comfortable

502
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,000
as riding my old donkey.

503
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,510
Hanzhou is already in sight from afar.

504
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,980
Yunding should be close too, right?

505
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,150
Although Yunding is under the jurisdiction of Hanzhou,

506
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,550
it's located at the westernmost edge.

507
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,410
It's quite far from Hanzhou City.

508
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,150
Ah, the matters of life

509
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,940
are always so difficult.

510
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,620
Even if you just want to have a sip

511
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,310
of the wine from Yunding.

512
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,150
We have been traveling through the Gobi Desert

513
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,070
for a long time.

514
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,940
Further ahead is still the vast desert.

515
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,590
I'm afraid

516
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,630
we won't be able to see

517
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,100
green mountains and trees anymore.

518
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,960
That's not necessarily the case.

519
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,230
Just outside Hanzhou City,

520
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,990
there is a mountain called Mount Taiyin.

521
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,790
It's said to have the most beautiful moonlight scenery

522
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,190
in the mortal world.

523
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,350
The peaks there are lush with greenery

524
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,590
and the green trees provide ample shade.

525
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,190
Moreover,

526
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,880
it's like spring all year round.

527
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,560
Walking in the mountains there

528
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,360
is said to be

529
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,660
like being in Jiangnan or Bashu.

530
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,440
I can't believe there's such a wonderful place.

531
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,840
Then we must go and see it.

532
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,550
I heard from my master that

533
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,550
there is a special organization in Jianghu

534
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,580
called...

535
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,340
The Taiyin Sect.

536
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,540
Is it related to Mount Taiyin?

537
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,640
This is an old story from many years ago.

538
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,870
A hundred years ago,

539
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,110
at the beginning of the founding of our Great Tang Dynasty,

540
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,700
there was a warlord in the northwest named Duan Gui.

541
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,960
He was supported by the six noble clans of Hanzhou,

542
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,310
so he seized territory and proclaimed himself king.

543
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,820
Later,

544
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,390
he was defeated by our Emperor, Taizong of the Tang Dynasty.

545
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,190
Duan Gui was exceptionally skilled in martial arts.

546
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,670
Even when he lost his right arm in the fierce battle,

547
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,750
he wielded a saber in his left hand

548
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,160
and killed several of our great generals.

549
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:15,990
In the end,

550
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,300
he climbed up a tower and burned himself to death.

551
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,410
The Taiyin Sect you mentioned

552
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,270
is formed by

553
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,760
Duan Gui's descendants.

554
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,990
The sect members all worship moonlight.

555
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,200
They say our Great Tang represents the Earth element

556
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,060
and reveres sunlight,

557
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,890
which is the enemy of moonlight.

558
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,410
They use this heretical rhetoric to control the sect members

559
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,140
and oppose the imperial court.

560
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:40,860
If you ask me,

561
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,110
let's not go to

562
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,390
Mount Taiyin anymore.

563
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,550
What if we run into some

564
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,670
heretics?

565
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,130
We'd be in danger.

566
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,320
No, that won't happen.

567
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,240
During Empress Wu Zetian's reign,

568
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,980
my mentor submitted multiple memorials to the throne.

569
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,070
The imperial court already dispatched troops

570
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,790
and wiped them all out.

571
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,630
Wait.

572
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,790
In the legends, did Duan Gui

573
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,300
ride a rhinoceros?

574
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,390
Was it a rhinoceros?

575
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,010
I can't remember clearly.

576
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,790
That's right

577
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,440
It was a rhinoceros.

578
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,990
According to the records,

579
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,410
the rhinoceros had three horns on its head

580
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,990
with sharp, saw-like teeth,

581
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,790
which could break through thousands of troops and horses.

582
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,910
Are you saying...

583
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,150
The tattoos on the shoulders

584
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,750
of those bandits at Qianchong Dock

585
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,750
were the three-horned rhinoceros.

586
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,510
And that Boat officer

587
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,020
once declared that...

588
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,380
If you want to kill, then kill me.

589
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,200
Sect leader will avenge us.

590
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,460
Sect leader...

591
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,980
Rhinoceros...

592
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,180
Lu Lingfeng,

593
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,060
you suspect those people are

594
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,350
remnants of the Taiyin Sect?

595
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,380
[Governor of Hanzhou, Liao Xin]

596
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,190
[Judicial Adjutant of Hanzhou, Ma Meng]

597
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,950
Governor Liao.

598
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,810
You have been worshipping

599
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,070
for the past two hours.

600
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,820
[Huian Temple Abbot, Master Wu Liang]

601
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,490
We can go to the meditation room for some tea now.

602
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,680
Please

603
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,850
Master

604
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,400
This time, I came to the temple

605
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,710
not only because of

606
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,110
the habit of worshipping Buddha every three days.

607
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,030
There is also something else

608
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,550
that I want to discuss with you, Master.

609
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,350
Please go ahead, Governor Liao.

610
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,190
Recently in Hanzhou,

611
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,030
although it seems peaceful and uneventful,

612
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,560
there are

613
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,400
undercurrents surging.

614
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,950
Theft

615
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,580
and murder cases have occurred frequently.

616
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,130
Judicial Adjutant Ma Meng

617
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,810
is too busy to handle them all.

618
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,150
At this time,

619
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,620
the tongue relic of Master Moshi

620
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,190
is no longer safe to be kept in the temple.

621
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,190
Well

622
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,510
It can be sent to the government office for safekeeping.

623
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,910
Master

624
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,310
Master

625
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,550
Didn't you invite me

626
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,480
to have tea in the meditation room?

627
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,150
Yuan He,

628
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:52,960
see the guest out.

629
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,350
Yes.

630
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,030
Master.

631
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:55,570
Master,

632
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,990
The matter of the tongue relic

633
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,050
is no child's play.

634
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,710
Now,

635
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,250
the Taiyin Sect has risen from the ashes,

636
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,410
gathering a large number of followers

637
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,550
and harboring ill intentions.

638
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,400
I'm afraid they're coveting

639
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,260
the tongue relic of Master Moshi.

640
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,699
Once the treasure is stolen by them

641
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,750
and exchanged for gold and silver,

642
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,420
it will be used to oppose the court.

643
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,750
That would be terrible.

644
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,860
I will go into seclusion immediately

645
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
and chant scriptures for seven days

646
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,030
to eliminate your greed.

647
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,790
Who's being greedy?

648
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,000
Wu Liang!

649
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,850
Wu Liang!

650
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,030
The tongue relic is Hanzhou's greatest treasure.

651
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,630
It doesn't belong to your Hui'an Temple alone.

652
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,790
If it's lost

653
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,400
and falls into the hands of the Taiyin Sect,

654
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,230
it will cost you your head!

655
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,360
Benefactor,

656
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,949
I'm afraid today

657
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,510
is not a good time for you to visit.

658
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,660
I was entrusted by someone.

659
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,190
Please notify your master.

660
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:01,790
Yes

661
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,050
Someone wants to see Master Wu Liang.

662
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,370
[Disciple of Master Wu Liang, Yuan He]

663
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,190
Master is going to practice in seclusion

664
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,050
No matter what,

665
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,950
please come back in seven days.

666
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,870
[Governor's Residence]

667
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,540
This old monk

668
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,590
is simply unreasonable!

669
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,190
If the tongue relic of Master Moshi

670
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,030
gets stolen,

671
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,280
it will be a disaster for Hanzhou.

672
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,590
Administrator Tian, Minister Ma.

673
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,120
We can't take this lightly.

674
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,520
We must immediately

675
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,830
send more men to Hui'an Temple.

676
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,820
[Administrator of Hanzhou, Tian Chou]

677
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,750
We can only

678
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,150
transfer troops from the Hanzhou Granary.

679
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,950
That's right.

680
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,810
From the Hanzhou Granary.

681
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,280
The more the better.

682
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,290
It's all because of that Wu Liang

683
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,110
who refused to hand over the relic

684
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,710
to the Prefectural Governor

685
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,590
What are you talking about?

686
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,790
What do you mean by handing it over to me?

687
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,110
It should be kept in the prefectural governor's office.

688
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,710
Yes, yes,

689
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,280
government office.

690
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,110
I misspoke.

691
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,950
Please forgive me, Prefectural Governor.

692
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,390
So,

693
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:11,230
about the matter of going into the mountains to suppress the Taiyin Sect...

694
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
The last two times

695
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,280
we returned empty-handed.

696
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,480
We couldn't even find

697
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,630
Taiyin Sect's lair.

698
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,150
The Area Command

699
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,680
mocked us quite a bit for it.

700
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,730
Do we still want

701
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,760
to go and suppress them again?

702
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,430
What do you think, Administrator Tian?

703
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,950
I also think we can put it on hold for now.

704
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,280
Besides, the Taiyin Sect

705
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,110
hasn't made any big moves lately.

706
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,150
Why provoke them?

707
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,150
But recently, some hunters claimed

708
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,350
they saw a strange wild beast

709
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,950
on Mount Taiyin.

710
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,210
In the Former Han dynasty,

711
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,880
the rare birds and strange beasts

712
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,710
from the Western Regions

713
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,110
got lost in Mount Taiyin.

714
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,840
Everyone knows about that.

715
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,570
In Mount Taiyin,

716
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,100
having strange wild beasts

717
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,350
is not strange at all.

718
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,280
But that beast was huge.

719
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,990
It resembled a rhinoceros

720
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,990
with three horns on its head

721
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,040
and saw-like teeth.

722
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,430
I

723
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,790
I suspect it's

724
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,310
a tongtian rhino.

725
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,390
A tongtian rhino?

726
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,550
That only exists in strange tales and stories.

727
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,450
The hunter must have

728
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,990
been hallucinating.

729
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,950
Exactly.

730
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,650
You believe this kind of thing

731
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,830
and even come to tell me about it?

732
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,990
The Taiyin Sect is getting more and more out of hand.

733
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,350
I'm afraid if we don't deal with it,

734
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:18,910
Hanzhou

735
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,440
will become more and more unsettled.

736
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,530
Who said we're not dealing with it?

737
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,230
Go and intensify the search in the city.

738
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,590
The state government and the Taiyin Sect cannot coexist.

739
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,590
This stance has never changed

740
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,350
from start to finish.

741
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,880
Yes.

742
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,430
Carpet.

743
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,310
Persian carpets.

744
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,390
Carpet.

745
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,590
Naan.

746
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,710
Fragrant naan.

747
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,030
Naan.

748
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,470
Delicious naan.

749
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,710
What?

750
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,720
Things didn't go smoothly?

751
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,980
The abbot of Hui'an Temple, Master Wu Liang,

752
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,590
is going into seclusion starting today.

753
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,350
He will only meet people after seven days.

754
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,390
Can't we just give it to one of the monks?

755
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,190
We still need to hurry on our way.

756
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,550
Well...

757
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,710
Without saying,

758
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,700
the treasure has to be handed

759
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,030
to the abbot himself.

760
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,670
Right?

761
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,150
Let's quickly find a place

762
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,750
to eat

763
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,320
I just saw a place called

764
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,830
Tianbao Restaurant.

765
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,550
The aroma of wine was wafting out...

766
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,030
I can't resist it anymore.

767
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,000
Alright,

768
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,630
Tianbao Restaurant it is.

769
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,990
Everyone has worked hard along the way.

770
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,620
Today,

771
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,820
have as much fine wine and delicacies you want.

772
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,740
My treat!

773
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,150
Two silver ingots?

774
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,630
How could you?

775
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,540
The government is transferring troops from the Hanzhou Granary.

776
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,870
How big of a deal is that?

777
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,860
This information of yours is indeed quite important.

778
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,390
But I'm not wealthy either.

779
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,660
I'll tell you the exact number of troops being transferred

780
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,150
for

781
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,790
ten pieces.

782
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,210
I only have eight silver ingots on me.

783
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,610
I'll give them all to you.

784
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,310
Deal.

785
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,650
What's the matter?

786
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,800
Is the information accurate?

787
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,000
How did you know about

788
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,190
such a confidential matter?

789
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,910
You're asking too much.

790
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,350
It's the rule of the Jianghu.

791
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,090
-Government Investigation.
-Government Investigation.

792
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,520
Minister Ma.

793
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,350
What brings you here?

794
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,350
None of your business.

795
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:58,880
Get lost.

796
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,790
Yes.

797
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,490
What are you doing?

798
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,850
What do you do for a living?

799
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,910
I'm a butcher.

800
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,160
Minister Ma.

801
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,270
That's right.

802
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,260
He's a butcher.

803
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,570
He's always drinking at my place.

804
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,670
Junior!

805
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,830
Master brought us to Hanzhou

806
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,350
to practice medicine

807
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,430
You must not cause any trouble!

808
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,170
Exactly!

809
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,490
This junior of yours is too young.

810
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,710
He is an official.

811
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,940
Can we afford to provoke him?

812
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,350
Your Honor,

813
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,910
you want to check his shoulder,

814
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,450
right?

815
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,540
Let me help you

816
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,540
Get out of the way.

817
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,590
If you're here to practice medicine,

818
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,250
why were you at Hui'an Temple?

819
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,380
-In our line of work...
-Did I ask you?

820
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,690
In our line of work,

821
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,280
whenever we arrive at a place,

822
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,950
we always go to

823
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,280
the local temple to pray

824
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,430
and ask for Buddha's blessings.

825
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,490
Praying to Buddha?

826
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,510
Why did you go to the meditation room then?

827
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,990
I wanted to see the abbot, Master Wu Liang,

828
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,190
to do some good deeds.

829
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,890
But I didn't get to see him.

830
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,670
You want to look at my shoulders, right?

831
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,990
You have a strong grip.

832
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,030
You've practiced martial arts.

833
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,350
Pretending to be a doctor and coming to Hanzhou.

834
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,710
You must be up to no good.

835
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,590
We're really doctors.

836
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:21,910
If you don't believe it,

837
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,090
let me diagnose you.

838
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,870
Hanzhou

839
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,350
doesn't need

840
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,310
Jianghu swindlers like you.

841
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,290
Leave as soon as possible

842
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:28,970
Otherwise

843
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,320
I, Judicial Adjutant Ma Meng,

844
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,550
will arrest you at any time.

845
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,720
Minister Ma, rest assured.

846
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,640
We will leave as soon as possible.

847
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,480
As soon as possible.

848
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,520
[Alcohol and meat]

849
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,270
The anti-imperial Taiyin Sect

850
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,400
is making a comeback

851
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,310
and has been rampant recently.

852
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,990
On the left shoulders of these people,

853
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,910
there is usually a tattoo of a

854
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:51,970
weird rhinoceros.

855
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,190
Anyone

856
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,160
who discovers any clues

857
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,710
must report them immediately.

858
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,440
Anyone who dares to harbor them

859
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,550
will be guilty of the same crime as the rebels.

860
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,920
Yes

861
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,470
Yes

862
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,620
That felt like we were on tenterhooks.

863
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,550
Isn't he just a judicial adjutant?

864
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,110
Why didn't you reveal

865
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,230
your own identity?

866
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,430
I don't know his background.

867
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,230
Why should I reveal my identity?

868
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,570
It's just that this feeling

869
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,970
of being held at knifepoint by someone else

870
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,030
is indeed quite different from being the Deputy President

871
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,360
Completely different.

872
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,070
Lu Lingfeng, oh, Lu Lingfeng.

873
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,670
You are really a changed man now.

874
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,200
Neither servile nor overbearing,

875
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,940
and not provoking trouble.

876
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:34,710
You've made progress.
