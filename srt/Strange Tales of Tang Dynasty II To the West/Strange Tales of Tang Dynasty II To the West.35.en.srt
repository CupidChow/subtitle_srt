[Episode 35]

4
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,420
I think it's best if I explain it.

5
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,590
Let me try to speculate again

6
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,630
without any evidence.

7
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,150
Ten years ago,

8
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,030
Chu Bin was saved by Ms. Yin.

9
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,960
She was revived from death,

10
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,750
and felt disheartened and hopeless.

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,110
She left Yunding,

12
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,120
but didn't

13
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,710
return back to her hometown

14
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,840
because she didn't want to,

15
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,829
and was even more ashamed of meeting

16
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:22,670
her only family in this world, her elder sister,

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,300
Chu Jia.

18
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,940
Chu Jia once said

19
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,520
she was strongly opposed to Chu Bin

20
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,190
returning to Yunding with Li Yun.

21
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,850
Therefore,

22
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,710
Su Wuming's speculation

23
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,000
makes a lot of sense.

24
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,750
Fang Jiong is a merchant

25
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,870
who is well-traveled.

26
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,840
In a foreign land,

27
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,870
he ran into Chu Bin by chance.

28
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,310
Let's go home.

29
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,170
Okay, let's go.

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,550
Chu Bin?

31
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,550
It's really you.

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,550
Wait a minute.

33
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,170
If you're not dead,

34
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,470
how could Li Yun not marry you?

35
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,930
And how did you end up here?

36
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,430
Also,

37
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,910
was the coffin back then

38
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,840
actually empty?

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,590
Why did you cooperate with Li Yun

40
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,790
to deceive Shen Ping?

41
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,680
Fang Jiong learned about

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,420
what happened ten years ago,

43
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,430
and thought of Shen Ping's current situation.

44
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,750
His former lover was getting more haggard day by day,

45
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,120
which already broke his heart.

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,470
But, Li Yun's behaviour and actions

47
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,750
in Yunding

48
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,350
was even more abhorrent to him.

49
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,470
Fang Jiong's appearance

50
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,630
also further ignited

51
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,870
Chu Bin's determination

52
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,030
for revenge.

53
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,590
Ms. Yin.

54
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,510
Chu Bin.

55
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,950
Chu Bin.

56
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,190
Fang Jiong found Ms. Yin,

57
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,940
and gave Ms. Yin the capital

58
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,150
to change the paper offering shop into Biluo Inn.

59
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,100
After the inn opened,

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,760
Mudan, who often had secret meetings with men,

61
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,950
became a regular customer.

62
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,530
Mudan, also a victim,

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,550
thus joined

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,670
those seeking vengeance.

65
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,710
Meanwhile,

66
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,180
Changle was unwilling to continue

67
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,500
being fooled by Li Yun,

68
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,909
and even more unwilling

69
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,750
to be an accomplice in poisoning Shen Ping.

70
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,580
Therefore,

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,200
she confessed everything to Shen Ping.

72
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,950
Shen Ping then went to find Fang Jiong.

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,740
Her childhood sweetheart,

74
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,950
at this time,

75
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,590
became the person she trusted the most.

76
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,480
Fang Jiong then simply

77
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,590
arranged for Chu Bin to meet Shen Ping.

78
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,940
The truth of what happened ten years ago was finally revealed.

79
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,670
The vengeance team

80
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,110
was also fully assembled.

81
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,030
Fang Jiong

82
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,150
had some knowledge

83
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,720
because he had heard of how

84
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,140
one could use the revival skill

85
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,930
to swindle money, as part of the so-called miscellenous arts.

86
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,770
Hence, he planned to take advantage of Li Yun's lust

87
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,090
as part of the scheme

88
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,950
to kill him.

89
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,590
But no one expected

90
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,670
before the revenge even started,

91
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,690
an accident happened.

92
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,640
And that was

93
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,000
Chu Bin, who had just returned to Yunding,

94
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,030
was bumped into by Li Men.

95
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,870
Stop right there!

96
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,210
Are you human or ghost?

97
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,920
Although Li Men does not hold a proper job,

98
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,010
he is candid and naive by nature,

99
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,310
and even have a strong sense of justice.

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,520
Li Men.

101
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,990
Choose for yourself.

102
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,890
Trying to scare me?

103
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,930
You think I'm afraid of death?

104
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,670
Fang.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,909
Are you getting involved in this matter

106
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,260
because after Shen Ping married Li Yun,

107
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,230
she continued to have an affair with you?

108
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,870
No!

109
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you dare to make a blood oath?

110
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,800
If indeed there was,

111
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,570
may I die a horrible death.

112
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,690
So... was it Chu Bin

113
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,010
who promised herself to you?

114
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,750
How dare you!

115
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,630
If that's true, may the heavens strike me with lightning.

116
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,890
Then why are you involved in this matter?

117
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,640
I saw it with my own eyes,

118
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,160
and it's still vivid in my mind.

119
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,190
I'm passionate about this,

120
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,750
so I had no choice but to act.

121
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,890
So much for your damned passion

122
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,290
and your lack of options.

123
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,440
Why not count me, Li Men, in as well?

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,830
Li Men's involvement

125
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,580
gave Shen Ping and Changle

126
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,420
an alibi to prove that they were not at the scene of murder.

127
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,890
By then, everything was in place.

128
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,730
Fang Jiong then took advantage of

129
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,690
the drinks after cockfighting

130
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,120
and pretended to mention

131
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,670
the revival skill to Li Yun unintentionally.

132
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,950
He claimed it could revive Chu Bin.

133
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,470
Li Yun, blinded by greed,

134
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,230
fell right into the trap.

135
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,190
On the night of the crime,

136
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,400
Fang Jiong did not go to Biluo Inn,

137
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,170
but instead hosted a banquet at home

138
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,700
that lasted all night long.

139
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,750
All the guests were

140
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,790
witnesses to his innocence.

141
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,590
Also,

142
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,310
the owner of Anyuan Inn that day,

143
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,870
Mr. Xu and his friend,

144
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,300
were probably also

145
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,789
hired by Fang Jiong to put on a show.

146
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,830
The whole act was meant

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,710
to mislead Sheriff Lu.

148
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,830
Thank you, boss.

149
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,660
Thank you.

150
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,870
Amazing!

151
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,790
She can really transform into my cousin.

152
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,190
Moreover, its exactly how my cousin looked

153
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,570
when I was 16 years old.

154
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,190
After all these years, I finally get to see her again.

155
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,190
I can die without regrets now.

156
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,790
Then Mr. Xu,

157
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,870
you can now rekindle your old flames,

158
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,310
and renew your love affair.

159
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,110
Despicable!

160
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,790
Back then, my cousin and I

161
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,550
were completely innocent.

162
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,870
Then, you didn't spend these

163
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,020
few silver ingots in vain.

164
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,790
Look at how petty you are.

165
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,620
How vulgar.

166
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,480
How unbearably vulgar!

167
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,430
Yes.

168
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,270
I've always felt that something was off.

169
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,670
Now that I think about it,

170
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,600
everything was simply too coincidental.

171
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,230
As for that Ding Dade,

172
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,680
he's probably not involved in the murder,

173
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,030
but he was aware of it.

174
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,130
So, he was overly nervous

175
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,450
and couldn't sleep.

176
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,870
Hence, he worked all night to rush out

177
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,760
Xijun's current set of clothing.

178
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,920
I agree with your analysis.

179
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,590
Next,

180
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,190
on the day of the crime,

181
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,560
Lu Lingfeng,

182
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,030
you investigated the crime scene quite thoroughly.

183
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,780
The floor is yours.

184
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,190
[Tianyi Fabric Shop]

185
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,670
The letter was written by Chu Bin.

186
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,870
As for the content of the letter,

187
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,000
it remains unknown.

188
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,470
But just the handwriting

189
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,590
was enough to trigger the curiosity in

190
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,720
lust-ridden Li Yun.

191
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,960
Afterwards,

192
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,800
he drank the soup

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,500
he had prepared for Shen Ping.

194
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,550
As it was a slow-acting poison,

195
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,350
drinking it made him drowsy.

196
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,830
You talk too much.

197
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,380
Although I've investigated the scene,

198
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,120
there are still many things

199
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,380
I couldn't figure out.

200
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,510
For example,

201
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,510
the candlestick Li Men used to hit Li Yun.

202
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,110
Why was it on the first floor?

203
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,510
All that can be surmised at this point is that

204
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,390
at that moment,

205
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,750
Li Men regretted it.

206
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,490
After all, Li Yun was his cousin

207
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,990
and they were related by blood.

208
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,240
No need to see me off.

209
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,020
Don't step out of this door.

210
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,470
Cousin!

211
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,350
Are you going upstairs

212
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,120
and have a rendezvous with a woman?

213
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,320
You guessed it, kid.

214
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,350
In your life,

215
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,950
how many women have you hurt?

216
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,600
Aren't you afraid that women will hurt you instead?

217
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,130
It's none of your business.

218
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,390
You've been so poor that in the past year or two,

219
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,710
you have yet to touch a woman, right?

220
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,910
You're a good-looking guy.

221
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,110
Can't you learn from me?

222
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,710
What should I learn from you?

223
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,750
You're a beast.

224
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,910
I'm telling you,

225
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,970
if you want to live,

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,060
don't go upstairs.

227
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,750
Are you crazy?

228
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,280
Listen to me, Li Yun.

229
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,520
Don't go upstairs.

230
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,520
Go home quickly,

231
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,460
get on your knees,

232
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,760
and apologize to Shen Ping.

233
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,430
Apologize to all the women that

234
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,160
you owe it to.

235
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,880
Are you crazy?

236
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,080
You're the one who's crazy.

237
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,410
I'm trying to save you.

238
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,720
You are trying to save me?

239
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,750
You're saving me?

240
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,380
Save me?

241
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,200
Bastard!

242
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,430
That bathtub

243
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,200
was specially prepared for Li Yun.

244
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,650
In the entire Shangxian Lane,

245
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,770
you wouldn't find another family inn

246
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,960
that has a bathtub that directly drains water

247
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,020
to the floor below.

248
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,010
With this bathtub,

249
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,470
the evidence can be quickly destroyed.

250
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,800
The old man with the cart

251
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,770
would pass through the back alley

252
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,230
at the same time every day.

253
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,350
Li Men calculated the right time

254
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,280
to climb down from the second floor

255
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,590
just to give himself

256
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,150
an alibi.

257
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,110
Su Wuming,

258
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,300
please repeat the postmortem findings again.

259
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,400
With boiling limewater,

260
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,150
a person would quickly suffocate to death.

261
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,750
And limewater

262
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,550
constricts the blood vessels in one's face,

263
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,290
causing the corpse to look slightly reddish

264
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,610
instead of the bluish-purple color.

265
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,430
As for the blood flowing from the mouth and nose,

266
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,390
it happened to be fully absorbed by the lime,

267
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,280
hence leaving no trace.

268
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,830
Afterwards, the limewater

269
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,110
was drained through the pipes

270
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,470
and the corpse was wiped down,

271
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,820
leaving no signs of murder at all.

272
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,510
It appeared as if he died from a sudden illness.

273
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,230
I think this was how

274
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,790
Li Yun died.

275
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,950
As for the division of labor among the individuals,

276
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,750
we'll need to make some guesses.

277
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,640
First of all,

278
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,390
someone had to strip Li Yun naked

279
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,510
and place him in the bathtub.

280
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,490
I'm going to guess that

281
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,670
Chu Bin did not do it herself.

282
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,230
After all,

283
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,870
she was hurt the worst

284
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,980
and loved the most.

285
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,120
Otherwise, ten years ago,

286
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,180
when she was rescued from the coffin,

287
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,579
she would have gone straight to the authorities to report him.

288
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,480
But she didn't.

289
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,640
These ten years,

290
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,790
how Chu Bin got through them,

291
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,670
we don't know.

292
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,720
But ten years later,

293
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,349
for her to finally choose revenge,

294
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,430
it's definitely not just because of

295
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,829
what had happened to her.

296
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,510
I'm afraid

297
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,700
she found out about

298
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,730
the experiences of

299
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,140
the few other victims.

300
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,980
According to preliminary investigation,

301
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,510
the women deceived by Li Yun

302
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,690
are definitely not limited to those few.

303
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,550
Li Yun should have died long ago.

304
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,840
They did a great job.

305
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,750
Why are you staring at me?

306
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,960
If it was up to me,

307
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,130
I would definitely use a sword

308
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,390
to cut open his chest

309
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,310
and see

310
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,070
what is his heart made of.

311
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,110
Yingtao.

312
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,920
You are now considered to be

313
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,910
working for the government office.

314
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,750
You should have a better sense of

315
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,140
what to say and what not to say.

316
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,270
I don't care.

317
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,070
Then...

318
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,790
how can we close the case?

319
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,390
Yeah.

320
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,350
You two have been talking for a long time.

321
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,810
So what's the conclusion?

322
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,310
There is no murderer in this case.

323
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,710
There is no murderer

324
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,120
in this case.

325
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,300
Sheriff Lu, you are enlightened.

326
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,230
I'm just stating the facts.

327
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,910
No one's actions

328
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,750
directly caused Li Yun's death.

329
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,350
What I just said

330
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,010
was just speculation.

331
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,880
If Li Yun had entered the bathtub himself,

332
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,070
or if those few women

333
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,510
did not collude in advance,

334
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,750
even if they did what I speculated

335
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,760
at another time,

336
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,550
Li Yun would still die,

337
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,840
wouldn't he?

338
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,390
How wise, Sheriff Lu.

339
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,030
Su Wuming.

340
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,190
I know you have a glib tongue,

341
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,240
but flattery won't work on me.

342
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,050
Follow me to

343
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,250
quickly report to Magistrate Huangfu.

344
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,850
[Yunding County Government Office]

345
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,000
Didn't they say there were civilians

346
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,300
surrounding the county government?

347
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
Why is no one here?

348
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,990
Indeed.

349
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,750
I'm sure Suo Long

350
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,600
wouldn't have misinformed us.

351
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,710
This case has no murderer?

352
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,310
How is that possible?

353
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,710
The most heinous criminal

354
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,080
has already confessed.

355
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,230
There are no ghosts in this world.

356
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,470
It was an evil person who committed the murder.

357
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,340
Just now, at the entrance of the county government,

358
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,540
I have already shared

359
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,270
this good news with the people.

360
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,750
The night market has already reopened.

361
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,300
The officials and people of Yunding

362
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,060
are drinking and celebrating.

363
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,390
Where did the murderer's confession come from?

364
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,390
It's from Heitou.

365
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,460
You were the one who caught him.

366
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,990
He is

367
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,590
responsible for more than 20 lives.

368
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,320
But Li Yun was not killed by him.

369
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,810
He has already admitted himself.

370
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,470
Why would you say it's not him?

371
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,990
Huangfu Tan,

372
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,340
you tortured him into confessing,

373
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,340
in order to find a scapegoat, right?

374
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,630
Investigating cases and arresting criminals,

375
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,560
that's your job.

376
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,930
Why would I torture him for a confession?

377
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,470
It was Heitou himself

378
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,210
who wanted to die quickly.

379
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,520
He specifically asked for me,

380
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,340
so I went to find him,

381
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,060
and then he confessed.

382
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,440
Here's the confession.

383
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
He even signed it.

384

Why are you kneeling here?

403

This is in the direction of Luoyang,

404

where our mentor's tomb is located.

405
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,090
When did you start kneeling here?

406
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,240
After I finished drinking last night.

407

You knelt for the whole night?

It was already midnight when we got back.

409

Actually, you don't need to kneel.

Mudan was bullied,

420

and her reputation had been completely ruined.

421
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,030

422
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,470
and is like a fresh flower which has withered.

423
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,750
These women all deserve sympathy.

424
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,870
They shouldn't be punished.

425

428

after a hundred years?

429
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,150
Our mentor also said,

430
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,340
the most important thing for an official

431
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,150
is to serve the people.

432

I feel uncomfortable.

445
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,450
That day, I was just about to leave

446
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,530
when I heard people arguing

447
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,030
in the room next door.

448
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,550
You clearly promised to marry me.

449
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,560
You must have misheard.

450
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,910
When did I ever agree to that?

451

You're crazy.

455
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,310
Then a woman came out,

456
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,160
and she looked quite young.

457
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,510
I was so furious.

458
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,310
I rushed into the room,

459
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,270

460

461
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,520

00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,990

That's right.

Heitou is indeed the murderer.

After Heitou was imprisoned,

there was no collusion with others.

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,430
Gather around.

568
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,830
Come witness this joyous occasion with me.

569
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,790
My godfather,

570
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,520
I pay my respects to you.

571
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,630
Ping,

572
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,950
please rise.

573
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,800
Today is a really happy day.

574
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,800
I, Fed, will make an exception.

575
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,650
Let's drink!

576
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,860
We're not going home until we're drunk.

577
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,230
H-how's that?

578
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,710
Approved.

579
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,870
Sheriff Lu.

580
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
What do you think?

581
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,790
Approved.

582
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,390
Okay.

583
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,580
[Xue Huan]

584
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,540
Master.

585
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,180
Master!

586
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,830
Master!

587
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,230
Xue Huan?

588
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,620
I thought I was seeing things.

589
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,690
It's really me!

590
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,240
I'm dirty.

591
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,270
Really dirty.

592
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,550
We haven't seen each other for half a year.

593
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,350
How did you...

594
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,500
get so tall?

595
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,410
Only when I grow taller can I

596
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,550
solve mysterious cases

597
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,870
and kill evildoers with you, Master.

598
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,600
Where did this youth come from?

599
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,510
How arrogant!

600
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,000
What abilities do you have

601
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,320
to kill evildoers?

602
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,190
If you underestimate me,

603
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,590
you're also underestimating my Master.

604
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,150
Try me if you don't believe me.

605
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,430
Alright, let's have a go then.

606
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,960
Xue Huan.

607
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,910
He is a county officer.

608
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,780
I don't care what kind of officer he is.

609
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,170
Think about footwork.

610
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,330
Sheriff Lu.

611
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,560
You're biased towards him.

612
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,000
He is my direct master.

613
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,400
I am his direct disciple.

614
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,270
Who is he going to favor

615
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,530
if he doesn't favor me?

616
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,880
Look at you, kid.

617
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,990
You've not only grown taller in the past six months,

618
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,670
but also became much stronger.

619
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,470
Are you not going to help Officer Suo up?

620
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,030
Yes.

621
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,540
Sheriff Lu.

622
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,320
Is he really your disciple?

623
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,670
What's wrong with that?

624
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,170
I travelled south with my master

625
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,790
and investigated countless of mysterious cases.

626
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,230
I also helped my master slay

627
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,470
the Meteorite Bear in Dongdu.

628
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,870
Alright, stop bragging.

629
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,510
I haven't asked you yet.

630
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,030
Why aren't you studying in Luoyang

631
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,630
and came to Yunding instead?

632
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,710
Master.

633
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,080
I need to speak with you in private.

634
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,600
Everyone, back to your duties.

635
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,469
Yes.

636
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,310
Sheriff Lu!

637
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,949
Magistrate Huangfu.

638
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,270
Congratulations, congratulations.

639
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,590
It's great news!

640
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,139
What do you mean?

641
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,830
The golden peach from Kang

642
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,840
is the best fruit in the world.

643
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,960
The last time it was given as tribute

644
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,940
was during Emperor Taizong's reign.

645
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,550
Now that the new emperor has ascended the throne,

646
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,219
the king of Kang has given 18 crates of golden peaches

647
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,270
to congratulate him.

648
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,870
They will arrive in Shazhou at the beginning of next month.

649
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,310
What does it have to do with me?

650
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,469
Hanzhou's Commandery

651
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,969
sent an official document

652
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,860
saying that they had received an imperial edict

653
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,810
ordering you, Lu Lingfeng,

654
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,270
to escort the golden peaches to the capital.

655
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,590
Mr. Lu,

656
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,870
this is a great turning point

657
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,990
for your career.

658
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,190
This is the official document.

659
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,050
The higher-ups ordered you to depart immediately.

660
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,580
To escort golden peaches?

661
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,790
How has your time been

662
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,080
at Blessing Temple?

663
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,550
There are the best teachers

664
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,950
who taught me how to read.

665
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,050
The daily meals

666
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,180
are also the best.

667
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,760
I grow up fast,

668
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,270
so every two months,

669
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,830
Abbot Guangxiao will

670
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,390
make new clothes for me to wear

671
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,350
I, Xue Huan,

672
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,270
has never lived

673
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,600
such a good life before.

674
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,150
Thank you, Your Highness.

675
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,230
The kids in the temple

676
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,320
all call you Bodhisattva.

677
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,780
You don't need to thank me.

678
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,890
Just remember.

679
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,030
You have to spend your life

680
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,790
repaying Lu Lingfeng.

681
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,590
Her Highness asked me to come to Yunding

682
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,920
to see how you are doing,

683
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,620
and even asked you to write to her to let her know you're safe.

684
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,870
Her Highness also said that

685
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,510
when the situation in Chang'an stabilizes,

686
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,710
she will find a chance to let you go back.

687
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,370
But, now is not the right time.

688
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,710
In that case,

689
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,190
it was not Her Highness' idea to have you

690
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,390
escort the golden peaches back to the capital?

691
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,230
Of course not.

692
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,310
Master.

693
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,870
This trip is bound to be dangerous.

694
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,750
You mustn't go.

695
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,310
Xue Huan.

696
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,590
That was not appropriate.

697
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,480
Since it's not Her Highness,

698
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,960
it must be the new emperor

699
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,240
who summoned you back.

700
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,980
How can you not go?

701
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,910
The new Emperor is the former Crown Prince

702
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,870
who values my master highly.

703
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,870
But Her Highness' care and concern for my master

704
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,470
is also genuine and sincere.

705
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,870
I can definitely feel so.

706
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,210
Now, Her Highness is

707
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,000
seriously pitting herself against the new emperor.

708
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,790
Everyone in Luoyang and Chang'an knows that.

709
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,110
They each have their own power in the court.

710
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,640
It's not too much to say that

711
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,440
they're incompatible.

712
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,270
If Master returns to the capital at this time,

713
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,870
you'll be stuck in the middle

714
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,290
and it'll be hard to stay on the fence.

715
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,350
Xue Huan.

716
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,760
Why are you suddenly

717
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,230
taller than me all of a sudden?

718
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,760
Let's go.

719
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,430
Come to my room for a chat.

720
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,470
I'll go book the best restaurant.

721
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,150
Tonight,

722
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,480
let's all get drunk.

723
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,590
What are you thinking about?

724
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,710
I'm thinking about how I, Lu Lingfeng,

725
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,210
have no chance to fight on the battlefield.

726
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,400
Instead, I have to return to the capital by merit of escorting peaches.

727
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,320
So what if I go back?

728
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,270
Will the dark clouds from the past be lifted?

729
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,030
Are you sensing that

730
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,230
there's an unpredictable danger ahead of you

731
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,430
and want to refuse?

732
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,570
I just don't want to waste my time in vain.

733
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,430
Instead of being dragged into such fights,

734
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,670
why don't we build a canal in the fields of Yunding

735
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,430
for the people?

736
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,200
For you to say something like that,

737
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
our late mentor's spirit in heaven

738
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,990
would be happy for you.

739
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,400
But His Majesty has summoned you.

740
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,190
You must return.

741
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,110
Chang'an will always be in my heart.

742
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,510
Even in my dreams,

743
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,310
I'm risking my life for the country.

744
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,510
Now that there is an order from the court,

745
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,870
and Hanzhou's Commandery has also issued an official document,

746
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,790
I must go.

747
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh right,

748
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,670
Magistrate Huangfu told me two days ago that

749
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,310
he wanted to hire you, Su Wuming,

750
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,950
as Yunding's Market Supervisor.

751
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,110
I think it's a great idea.

752
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,170
In the future, Yunding's prosperity

753
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,390
and the order of the market

754
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,320
is in your hands.

755
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,610
Together with Fei's Yunding Clinic,

756
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,610
I, Lu Lingfeng,

757
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,390
can consider it as leaving

758
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,990
two noble folks for Yunding.

759
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,270
You...

760
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,950
seem very pessimistic.

761
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,710
In this case,

762
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,790
how can I watch you get sucked into the whirlpool

763
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,390
and yet do nothing about it as your brother?

764
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,270
How can I enjoy peace

765
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,510
in Yunding alone?

766
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,910
For the sake of Xijun,

767
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,570
I beg you to stay in Yunding

768
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,070
and take good care of her.

769
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,630
If she meets someone better...

770
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,630
Stop right there!

771
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,520
Xijun loves you very much.

772
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,080
How can you say such things?

773
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,780
Besides, who can persuade Xijun to

774
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,710
not go back to the capital with you?

775
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,740
What should we do?

776
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,710
Xue Huan!

777
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,870
Xue Huan!

778
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,270
Xue Huan!

779
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,710
Fed!

780
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,820
Not even a year,

781
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,270
and you already look a bit like your master

782
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,070
in the way

783
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,470
you carry yourself.

784
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,980
With youths like you,

785
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,600
our Tang is not afraid of

786
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,430
strong enemies in the future.

787
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,970
Well said.

788
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,270
That sentence articulates

789
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,870
the century-long plan of Tang.

790
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,470
You have a heart for the world, Fed.

791
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,890
The restaurant is booked.

792
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,190
Great.

793
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,310
What do you guys think

794
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,680
about going to Shazhou?

795
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,390
I remember at Mo's Inn,

796
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,790
Lu Lingfeng once said

797
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,210
he travelled west to take his family

798
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,940
to Mogao Caves to return a wish.

799
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,830
I thought you were lying at that time.

800
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,990
Now, it seems like

801
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,590
it was premeditated.

802
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,910
The Mogao Caves in Dunhuang

803
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,950
have been famous for its murals

804
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,880
since it opened during the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

805
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,720
We've been travelling west

806
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,030
to come to Yunding.

807
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,020
Sheriff Lu, can you bring Xijun along

808
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,830
to see the Mogao Caves?

809
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,910
It's indeed my dream

810
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,880
to be able to go to Dunhuang.

811
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,870
Lu Lingfeng

812
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,230
has offered to take me there more than once.

813
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,090
I didn't expect

814
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,080
to fulfill this wish so soon.

815
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,390
I'm so happy,

816
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,810
I don't know what to say!

817
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,050
I told you she'd be happy about it.

818
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,510
Of course.

819
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,750
Not only the murals in Dunhuang

820
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,710
are famous,

821
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,870
the brightest pearls are also found

822
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,670
in the Western Region's desert.

823
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,710
And more importantly, there is good wine.

824
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,110
Even better than Yunding's.

825
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,800
Chicken Fed.

826
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,500
Uncle Fed.

827
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,600
-Didn’t you quit drinking?
-Didn’t you quit drinking?

828
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,790
Y-Yes, I did.

829
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,550
But at the time I said

830
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,720
if I didn't cure all the mute slaves

831
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,710
of Yunding,

832
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,510
I would never drink again.

833
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,930
T-That's what I said, right?

834
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,950
Seems so.

835
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,430
I heard

836
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,650
90% of the mute slaves have been cured.

837
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,460
But there's still 10% left.

838
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,710
That 10%...

839
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,630
My disciples and their disciples

840
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,830
have already mastered

841
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,190
the treatment methods.

842
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,830
Before this summer ends,

843
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,990
I promise all the mute slaves

844
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,910
will be fully recovered.

845
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,970
So on this trip to Shazhou,

846
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,720
I just want to drink a little

847
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,130
and feel good about it.

848
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,870
That...

849
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,560
Is that okay?

850
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,950
Alright.

851
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,990
It's settled then.

852
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,380
The six of us

853
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,990
will set out tomorrow

854
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,140
and continue west

855
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,710
to Dunhuang.

856
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,540
I'd like to make a poem.

857
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,060
The vast desert is boundless.

858
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,560
The plains are boundless.

859
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,140
And that's mainly because

860
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,600
there's no more wine left.

861
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,990
That is not a poem.

862
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,350
I actually thought of two lines

863
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,010
Let's see which one of you can carry it on.

864
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,280
As I walk and lament the distance of the army,

865
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,340
I sit in pity with my coat.

866
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,070
The river meets the skies,

867
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,310
and the small stream meets the quicksand.

868
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,090
This I know too.

869
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,990
It was written by Luo Binwang.

870
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,350
The two sentences behind are,

871
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,590
"As I continue to travel,

872
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,780
I don't know when I'll return.

873
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,460
My heart breaks in despair,

874
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,030
and I cry every night."

875
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,230
This is Luo Binwang's

876
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,510
"Missing the Capital on a Late Night at Tianshan Mountain".

877
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,440
It's a good poem.

878
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,340
I also remember two lines too.

879
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,540
The bowstring embraces the moon of Han,

880
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,990
and the horse's feet trample the dust of Hu.

881
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,390
I don't seek to survive in the frontier,

882
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,260
but I'd die to repay you.
