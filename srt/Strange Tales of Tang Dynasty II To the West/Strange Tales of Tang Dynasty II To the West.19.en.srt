What did you hear just now?

5
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,030
They seemed to be

6
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,630
trading information

7
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,680
about Hanzhou Granary.

8
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,030
Hanzhou Granary?

9
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,550
It's said that Hanzhou Granary

10
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,810
is the largest granary in the northwest.

11
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,590
Yes.

12
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,470
If something happens to it,

13
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,910
the northwest will face unrest.

14
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,710
If there's unrest in the northwest,

15
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,840
the whole country will be endangered.

16
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,640
Are the two of them

17
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,930
really associated with the Taiyin Sect?

18
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,070
Things are so complicated in Hanzhou.

19
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,829
How about

20
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,310
we go to Yunding

21
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,250
and take up the post first?

22
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,190
I know Lu Lingfeng.

23
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,430
I'm afraid

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,190
we have to stay in Hanzhou for a few days.

25
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,670
Sheriff Jiang trusts me.

Just now, in Hui'an Temple,

30
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,230
I even saw the prefectural governor of Hanzhou.

31
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,230
You know the prefectural governor?

32
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,350
Great.

33
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:00,550

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,350
which restaurant has the best wine.

35
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,960
We'll drink as much as we want

36
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,800
and sleep as long as we want.

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,310

38
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,960
Where will we sleep?

39
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,550
In an inn.

40
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,150
I saw a few on my way here.

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,670
All big and cozy.

42
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,590
We almost died

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,590

44
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,600

47
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,600
doesn't welcome us either.

We don't have enough money anyway.

53

Buying one is out of the question,

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,350
but we can rent one.

55
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,790

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,560
What do you want?

194
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,870
I haven't done anything yet.

195
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,990
Behave yourself.

196
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,710
Otherwise,

197
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,310
I won't let you walk out of my store.

198
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,020
He's actually threatening us.

199
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,429
Long Fa

200
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,280
is Ami's husband.

201
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,410
He's out for business

202
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,920
and his wife Ami

203
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,790
wants to rent out their house?

204
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,230
You lied and said

205
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,520
Ami was your sister,

206
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,010
but when you talked about her,

207
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,810
you looked like you were talking about your lover.

208
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,390
Is Long Fa

209
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,760
already dead

210
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,050
and will never be back?

211
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,080
You…

212
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,670
That's nonsense.

213
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,050
Does that sound like nonsense to you?

214
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,830
Fine.

215
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,830
Let's go to the government office together

216
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,150
and have Minister Ma investigate it thoroughly.

217
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,670
Maybe he can uncover a murder.

218
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,150
You…

219
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,190
You know Minister Ma?

220
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,350
I don't just know him.

221
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,750
Besides,

222
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,670
it doesn't matter if I know him or not.

223
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,560
Someone may have been killed.

224
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,780
He has to do something!

225
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,440
Wait, wait.

226
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,580
We businessmen

227
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,730
want nothing to do

228
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,330
with the judicial adjutant.

229
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,480
I don't want to antagonize you.

230
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,660
Please leave.

231
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,470
I have to rent this house today.

232
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,080
But now, I really

233
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,470
don't know where Long Fa and Ami are.

234
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,910
How about this?

235
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,470
I'll lower the rent even more.

236
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,990
The price he offered just now.

237
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,070
3500 coins.

238
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,140
1500 coins.

239
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,150
Change the contract.

240
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,350
Amazing.

241
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,910
I just found out today

242
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,910
that Su Wuming is much better at bargaining than me.

243
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,790
Don't get too excited yet.

244
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,230
This is a bit unsettling.

245
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,310
I cut the price

246
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,030
so easily.

247
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,790
Maybe it's a haunted house.

248
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,550
Brother.

249
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,070
Don't scare us.

250
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,020
If it's a haunted house,

251
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,150
I'll have nightmares

252
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,510
at night.

253
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,750
I've checked every room.

254
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,190
They're all very clean.

255
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,310
Are you satisfied, Sheriff Lu?

256
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,510
Not bad.

257
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,130
Ever since I started working at the Supreme Court,

258
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,030
I've never had

259
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,050
any leisure time.

260
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,670
We're staying here

261
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,350
for 7 days.

262
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,990
I didn't expect Hanzhou

263
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,050
to be a place where I

264
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,000
could sleep as long as I wanted.

265
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,620
To sleep well,

266
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,160
you need to drink well.

267
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,300
I'll go buy some wine and meat.

268
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,110
I'll buy

269
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,560
two chickens too.

270
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,850
We saved so much money on the rent.

271
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,650
It's worth a celebratory drink.

272
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,120
Buy four chickens.

273
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:14,940
Four?

274
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,930
You scared me!

275
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,180
Make some noise next time.

276
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,890
Otherwise,

277
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,410
I may mistake you for an assassin

278
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,140
and kill you.

279
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,590
Fine.

280
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,550
My bad.

281
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,990
My bad, okay?

282
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,840
You said you wanted to sleep as long as you wanted.

283
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,270
Why…

284
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,730
You're up too, aren't you?

285
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,670
I was sleeping

286
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,860
but was woken up by a nightmare.

287
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,920
A nightmare?

288
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,110
I jinxed it.

289
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,390
This mansion

290
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,510
is very likely haunted.

291
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,200
Yingtao and I checked

292
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,730
every corner of this house.

293
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
Nothing's wrong.

294
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,270
The house is clear,

295
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,870
but how about the yard?

296
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,790
It looks like this backyard

297
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,150
hasn't been tended to for a long time.

298
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,570
Who's there?

299
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:50,960
I was scared!

300
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,190
Why is this well sealed?

301
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,090
These footprints must have been

302
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,000
left recently.

303
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,960
Moreover,

304
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,470
the person must be carrying something heavy

305
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,930
to leave such deep prints.

306
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,570
Move aside.

307
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,610
It's a dry well.

308
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,750
Give me the flame stick.

309
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,440
Be careful.

310
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,820
Lu Lingfeng, is everything alright?

311
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,370
Roll the winch.

312
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,210
Put some strength into it.

313
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,910
Long Fa

314
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,690
was indeed murdered by his wife

315
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,890
and the Cao guy.

316
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,270
After moving in,

317
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,600
we found a corpse.

318
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,170
If we ignore it,

319
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,600
we'll appear suspicious.

320
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,860
But if we don't,

321
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,110
we'll have to deal with the government.

322
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,190
In that case…

323
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,120
Lu Lingfeng,

324
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,040
you have to visit the prefectural governor.

325
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,460
Nothing unusual on his body,

326
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,120
just a dent on the back of his skull.

327
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,040
He should've died from blunt force trauma to the back of his head

328
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,080
caused by something like a hammer.

329
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,000
If the murderer didn't use a Heng sword,

330
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,530
this sword is not the murder weapon.

331
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,130
Then why was it thrown into the well

332
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,170
with the body?

333
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,070
This sword looks quite new.

334
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,970
It should be newly forged.

335
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,910
It's delicate,

336
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
but its blade

337
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,470
is half an inch wider

338
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,090
than the official standard.

339
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,290
It should be for civilian use.

340
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,780
According to the laws of Tang,

341
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,830
commoners can make swords,

342
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,950
bows, arrows, shields,

343
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
and short spears.

344
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,310
But the craftsmen

345
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,170
must engrave their names on them.

346
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,110
On this sword…

347
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,030
It's here.

348
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,190
Fed.

349
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,780
[Mu's, Hanzhou]

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,950
[Mu's, Hanzhou]

351
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,000
Lu Lingfeng.

352
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,590
The Taiyin Sect?

353
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,080
The warrant given by Censor Xie

354
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
comes in handy.

355
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,950
Otherwise, the investigation

356
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,010
would be improper and illegitimate.

357
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,710
The corpse was found

358
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,510
in this house.

359
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,589
Therefore,

360
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,710
we must start the investigation

361
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,310
with the owner of this house.

362
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,680
Lu Lingfeng.

363
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,000
"Mu's, Hanzhou"

364
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,690
should be a smithy.

365
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,510
It should

366
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,550
be in the city.

367
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,500
This clue is easy to follow.

368
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,109
However,

369
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,990
it may be a bit dangerous.

370
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,830
It seems we need to split up.

371
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,570
How should we split up?

372
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,350
How about this?

373
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,060
I and…

374
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,910
The warrant was granted to you by Censor Xie.

375
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,430
You should be the one

376
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,430
giving the orders.

377
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,720
Then Xijun and I will go to the smithy.

378
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,780
You and Yingtao

379
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,070
will look into the house's owner.

380
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,550
Okay?

381
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,190
What about me?

382
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,070
Chicken Fed, he means,

383
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,240
suit yourself.

384
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,790
Suit…

385
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,250
You can stay home and drink.

386
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,010
Don't you have a lot of wine?

387
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,630
No way!

388
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,840
From Nanzhou to Chang'an

389
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,070
and during this trip to the west,

390
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,680
I, Chicken Fed,

391
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,600
have been more than just a great doctor.

392
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,920
Now, I even feel like

393
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,870
I'm a great detective.

394
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,830
Since the smithy is dangerous,

395
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,190
I'll go there with you.

396
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,290
It's decided then.

397
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,350
Drink well and sleep well.

398
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,030
After waking up, we'll solve this case.

399
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,910
This city is prosperous,

400
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,670
but it's only as large as

401
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,830
half of the East and West Markets in Chang'an.

402
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,870
Mu's smithy

403
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,570
should not be hard to find.

404
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,010
I've asked around.

405
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,090
In Hanzhou, there are three smithies

406
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,820
capable of forging swords,

407
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,670
all located at the end of this street.

408
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,800
Just walk straight.

409
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,390
Fed,

410
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,700
they sell great roast chicken nearby.

411
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,270
Chicken?

412
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,430
Where?

413
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,040
Right up the street.

414
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,420
Stop kidding.

415
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,390
We have work to do.

416
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,000
I can buy the chicken later.

417
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,190
When we're done, the chicken will be sold out.

418
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:54,720
Xijun.

419
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,020
Take Fed to buy the chicken first.

420
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,960
Chicken Fed.

421
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,670
Lu Lingfeng is more observant than you.

422
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,630
Just trust him.

423
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:04,940
Let's go.

424
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,060
[Suo's Smithy]

425
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,710
What are you doing?

426
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,910
W-What are you doing?

427
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,800
Who are you guys?

428
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,430
Why are you arresting me?

429
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,210
You'll find out soon.

430
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:29,820
Quiet!

431
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,480
Why did you go to the smithy?

432
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,090
Tell me!

433
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,070
I…

434
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,940
I wanted to forge a sword.

435
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,110
He was sneaky.

436
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,920
I think

437
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,070
he must be from the Taiyin Sect.

438
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,270
What Taiyin Sect?

439
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,550
I'm just a commoner.

440
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,860
I hesitated 'cause I couldn't decide

441
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,030
whether to forge a Heng sword

442
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,030
or a short spear.

443
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,570
I wanted to go back home

444
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,510
and ask my wife.

445
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,370
Cut the crap.

446
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,070
Take him to the government office.

447
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,510
Move.

448
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,900
What are you doing?

449
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,500
Move!

450
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,830
Corpse?

451
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,860
Let's have a word in private.

452
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,050
Just talk here.

453
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,560
Long Fa just left home

454
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,390
for business.

455
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,930
How could he be killed?

456
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,950
Besides,

457
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,270
who on earth are you guys?

458
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,890
Why did you go down the well to examine the body?

459
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,130
To tell you the truth,

460
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,070
the new sheriff of Yunding County

461
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,530
is my superior.

462
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,010
The Investigating Censor

463
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,460
ordered us

464
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,870
to investigate cases along the way.

465
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,990
Now, I need

466
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,950
to see Ami right away

467
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,550
and ask her some questions.

468
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,230
I don't know

469
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,820
where Ami lives.

470
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,780
You don't know?

471
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,070
Yingtao.

472
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,190
Boss Cao.

473
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,790
Someone died in the house

474
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,370
you rented out.

475
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,110
Won't you do something about it?

476
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,830
What?

477
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,870
Someone died?

478
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,360
Then we have to go to the government office

479
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,820
to get things straight.

480
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,430
Is that true or not?

481
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,240
What do you mean

482
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,070
someone died?

483
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,150
Tell us about it.

484
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,390
No one died.

485
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,870
How is that possible?

486
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,630
They're my friends.

487
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,150
They love making jokes.

488
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,590
Tell me.

489
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,820
Where does Ami live?

490
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,750
I…

491
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,000
[Suo's Smithy]

492
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,270
[Mu's Smithy]

493
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,130
[Ou's Smithy]

494
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,680
My ginger is expensive.

495
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,420
You won't buy it. Leave.

496
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,840
Expensive?

497
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,430
Even if I don't have a penny on me,

498
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,430
you have to give me

499
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,690
a piece of ginger for free.

500
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,690
Why should I?

501
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,750
You'll not only give me one

502
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,680
but also deliver it to my house.

503
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,230
Who do you think you are?

504
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,950
Who I am doesn't matter.

505
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,540
What matters is that

506
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,680
my uncle

507
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,500
is this guy.

508
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,480
P-Prefectural Governor Liao?

509
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,390
You know him?

510
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,150
You're not totally clueless.

511
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,160
My uncle

512
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,660
has been feeling cold lately.

513
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,210
He needs to drink ginger tea

514
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,470
to dispel the chill.

515
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,010
If Mr. Liao wants ginger,

516
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,670
he just needs to give the word.

517
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,830
Why are you buying it yourself?

518
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,510
Then I order you

519
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,450
to follow me

520
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,430
and deliver the ginger to my house.

521
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,950
My lady,

522
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,910
I have work to do.

523
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,790
Isn't Mr. Liao's health

524
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,150
more important than your work?

525
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,160
I need to ask Ma Meng

526
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,930
how he trained his men.

527
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,730
Please don't.

528
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,270
My lady,

529
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,520
I'll deliver

530
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,150
the ginger for you.

531
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,500
Hurry up.

532
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,110
Luckily, you've met the prefectural governor.

533
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,110
I asked Xijun to draw that portrait.

534
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,420
What do you think?

535
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,880
It's a good idea, isn't it?

536
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,870
I thought you had drunk too much

537
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,130
to think straight.

538
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,350
No.

539
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,520
You can look down on me,

540
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,390
but you can't look down on the wine.

541
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,950
Believe it or not, after we go in,

542
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,580
with just 3 sentences,

543
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,550
I can find out everything we need to know.

544
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,710
Your words.

545
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,910
3 sentences?

546
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,680
3 sentences.

547
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,690
Where is your boss?

548
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,760
That counts too?

549
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,840
My boss is busy.

550
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,090
Just tell me what you need.

551
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,120
Heng swords?

552
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,950
Short spears?

553
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,120
Or other iron tools?

554
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,610
Get him out!

555
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,380
Tell him the leader

556
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,850
of the Taiyin Sect is here!

557
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,920
We said we wouldn't

558
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,710
make weapons for you anymore.

559
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,110
It was my boss' decision.

560
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,600
It had nothing to do with me.

561
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,190
What did I say?

562
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,120
Impressive.

563
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,030
You…

564
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,570
You played me.

565
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,810
I-I didn't say anything just now.

566
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,350
[Mu Linlang, the owner of Mu's Smithy]

567
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,400
What's going on?

568
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,450
Boss, he just…

569
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,230
I…

570
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,840
What on earth happened?

571
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,990
He claimed to be the leader

572
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,630
of the Taiyin Sect.

573
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,750
I was played.

574
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,870
Go back in.

575
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:56,780
Yes.

576
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,790
Who are you?

577
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,430
You made weapons

578
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,830
for the Taiyin Sect.

579
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,880
Heng swords in particular.

580
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,990
That's an anti-government organization.

581
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,890
Do you admit to your crime?

582
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,270
You're throwing charges right off the bat.

583
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,000
From the looks of it,

584
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,160
you're not government officials.

585
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,190
We're indeed not local officials.

586
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,270
But…

587
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,960
That thing of yours…

588
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,290
Take it out.

589
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,830
Xie Nianzu, the Investigating Censor,

590
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,510
inspected the western region

591
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,870
and granted the sheriff of Yunding County,

592
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,910
Lu Lingfeng,

593
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,670
this man,

594
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,750
the right to investigate cases

595
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,030
on his way to take up his post.

596
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,590
Understand?

597
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,470
If you don't believe it,

598
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,050
we can go to the prefectural governor to confirm it.

599
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,850
I wouldn't dare to question you.

600
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,470
Besides,

601
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,310
you have an impressive bearing

602
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,050
and are definitely not a bad person.

603
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,380
You have good judgment.

604
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,870
I made swords for the Taiyin Sect

605
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,220
over three months ago.

606
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,260
My Heng swords

607
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,490
are more expensive than others'.

608
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,860
2,500 coins each.

609
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,680
A normal iron Heng sword

610
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,060
costs 2,000 coins too.

611
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,910
Not to mention, it's said that you, Mu Linlang,

612
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,910
are the best blacksmith in Hanzhou.

613
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,270
I accept your price.

614
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,320
Then I'll forge one for you.

615
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,540
No.

616
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,710
I want ten.

617
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,460
What do you do?

618
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,330
I'm a merchant.

619
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,790
Then aren't ten too many?

620
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,750
The east-west trade routes have been unsafe lately.

621
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,700
My caravan travels between Shazhou

622
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,430
and Luoyang.

623
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,540
Without lethal weapons,

624
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,990
what should we do

625
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,270
in the face of bandits?

626
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,110
This is the deposit.

627
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,350
It's normal for caravans to order weapons

628
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,410
for self-defense.

629
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,740
Besides,

630
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,390
that young man had an air of nobility.

631
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,380
He did look like a wealthy merchant at first glance.

632
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,700
But unexpectedly,

633
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,990
a few days ago…

634
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,790
Tell me.

635
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,710
Among these ten Heng swords,

636
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,190
which was forged first

637
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,010
and which was forged last?

638
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,670
They're exactly the same.

639
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,810
Mu Linlang.

640
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,000
You're going to be rich.

641
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,630
Let's go.

642
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,980
Go into the mountain with me.

643
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,140
Mountain?

644
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,170
What mountain?

645
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,150
Mount Taiyin.

646
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,920
Who on earth are you?

647
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,280
The Taiyin Sect.

648
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,160
Don't be afraid.

649
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,120
Do I look like a bad guy to you?

650
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,950
You're a bunch of rebels.

651
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,140
Everyone knows that.

652
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,270
So what?

653
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,660
The father and son who founded Tang

654
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,420
were rebels too.

655
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,560
Your shop is too small.

656
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,690
Go into the mountain with me.

657
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,680
I'll build you the biggest smithy.

658
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,420
I haven't got

659
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,480
that much iron yet,

660
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,100
but with your excellent skills,

661
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,530
you'll never have to worry about orders.

662
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,750
Money will come pouring in.

663
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,810
If you perform well,

664
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,040
I'll make you a high-ranking official

665
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,900
who oversees weapon production.

666
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:06,860
In short,

667
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,750
I guarantee you'll be

668
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,040
showered with riches.

669
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,790
What if I refuse to go?

670
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,670
We'll have to do this the hard way!

671
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,070
My subordinate has a bad temper.

672
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,470
We have laws in Tang.

673
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,880
What can you do to me?

674
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,000
It seems your temper

675
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,100
is bad too.

676
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:31,960
Alright.

677
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,530
I'll give you three days to think it over.

678
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,590
Three days later, at 7 p.m.,

679
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,710
I'll come to you.

680
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,910
You could become filthy rich.

681
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,170
Why did you refuse him?

682
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,110
I'm running a smithy

683
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,390
to make a living.

684
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,300
But what I love most

685
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,750
is forging Heng swords.

686
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,910
My goal is not just to make money.

687
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,810
I want to forge the best

688
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,810
Heng sword in Tang

689
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,870
to eliminate the wicked.

690
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,720
So,

691
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,760
money can't tempt me.

692
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,870
Well said!

693
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,350
That guy will come back tonight.

694
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,680
What are you going to do?

695
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,870
After they left that day,

696
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,800
I told Minister Ma about it.

697
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,800
He promised to protect me.

698
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,270
So the ginger seller outside

699
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,870
indeed works for Ma Meng.

700
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,710
At 7 p.m.,

701
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,110
I'll come to join the fun.

702
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,240
But please don't tell

703
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,510
Ma Meng who I am.

704
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,850
Don't tell him.

705
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,610
[Miaose Dyeing Workshop]

706
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:04,990
Anyone?

707
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,210
Yingtao!

708
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,030
Who are you?

709
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,800
What are you doing here?

710
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,260
This is my home.

711
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,520
I should ask you that.

712
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,170
You must be Song Ami, right?

713
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,140
[Song Ami, Long Fa's wife]

714
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,980
You ruined my cloth.

715
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,470
Pay for it.

716
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,590
If you hadn't acted mysteriously,

717
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,050
would it have been ruined?

718
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,870
Who acted mysteriously?

719
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,990
Why are you wearing that makeup

720
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,190
in broad daylight?

721
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,430
I put on makeup

722
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,910
for men.

723
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,400
Are you jealous?

724
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,590
You…

725
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,910
She's your servant, isn't she?

726
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,570
I want you to pay me.

727
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,700
I'll compensate for the damaged cloth

728
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,950
at its full value.

729
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,110
But

730
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,880
I have some questions for you.

731
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,210
You need to answer me truthfully.

732
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,190
Go ahead.

733
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,590
Here's the thing.

734
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,390
Mr. Cao at the property agency

735
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,070
rented us your house

736
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,270
on Jinsha Street.

737
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,780
But…

738
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,490
But

739
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,380
he ripped you off.

740
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,780
Go argue with him.

741
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,590
1,500 coins per month

742
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,590
is not a rip-off, right?

743
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,710
What?

744
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,170
The price is a bit low,

745
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,350
but after we moved in,

746
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,870
we found a corpse

747
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,480
in the well in the backyard.

748
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,150
A corpse?

749
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,830
It can't be.

750
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,150
It was

751
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,940
a man's body.

752
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,080
That house was perfectly fine.

753
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,260
Right after you moved in,

754
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,440
a corpse was found?

755
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,080
You have a scholarly look.

756
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,530
Obviously, you're a well-educated man.

757
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,790
Could it be that

758
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,139
your servant

759
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,090
has an evil aura?

760
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,449
Who are you talking about?

761
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,630
Stop putting on airs.

762
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,510
No matter how heavy your makeup is,

763
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,270
it can't cover up the fact

764
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,870
that you're not a good woman.

765
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,690
Otherwise,

766
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,469
you wouldn't have hooked up with Cao Shuangli.

767
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,400
What did you say?

768
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,560
Can you swear

769
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,650
there's nothing between you and Cao?

770
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,980
Get out!

771
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,110
Tell her to get out!

772
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,750
I've thought it through.

773
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,010
I have to come with you.

774
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,010
Otherwise,

775
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,270
you'll make a scene at my store again.

776
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,790
How much

777
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,010
did you rent that house for?

778
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,870
Ami.

779
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,330
Let me explain.

780
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,760
Explain it on the way.

781
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,140
A corpse was found in your house.

782
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,940
You have to go and take a look.

783
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,350
They're government officials.

784
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,550
Wait here.

785
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,300
You.

786
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,710
Wait outside.

787
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,290
This is not Long Fa!

788
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,870
I don't know this man.

789
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,990
Mr. Cao.

790
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,420
You said this man is not Long Fa,

791
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,360
but the problem is that I never said

792
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,680
who the victim is.

793
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,430
Yesterday, didn't you suspect me

794
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,510
of killing Long Fa?

795
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,990
At that time,

796
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,920
I needed to rent this house

797
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,750
and was negotiating a low price.

798
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,150
Besides, at that time,

799
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,870
I hadn't discovered this corpse.

800
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,350
You…

801
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,320
Why are you

802
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,750
beating around the bush?

803
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,300
I just guessed the victim was Long Fa.

804
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,350
The one who died in this house

805
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,750
is most likely its owner.

806
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,750
Although Ami said

807
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,970
he left to do business…

808
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,970
I never said that.

809
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,260
You indeed didn't say it,

810
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,220
but…

811
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,800
but my brother must have

812
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,210
left to…

813
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:04,720
Hold on.

814
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,670
Your brother?

815
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,720
All these years,

816
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,960
I've worked with him.

817
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,250
He trusts me like his younger brother.

818
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,670
I respect him like an elder brother.

819
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,790
So the property agency belongs to Long Fa?

820
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,430
My brother is as cunning as a fox.

821
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,350
He wanted me to start another business.

822
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,110
After thinking it over, I felt

823
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,520
real estate was profitable,

824
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,180
so I opened a property agency.

825
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,710
Ami.

826
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,150
You just said Long Fa

827
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,590
didn't go out to do business, right?

828
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,140
He was in the fur trade.

829
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,710
In the past,

830
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,430
he often went to nearby villages to buy furs.

831
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,310
Each time,

832
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,070
he'd be gone for half a month.

833
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,150
But this time,

834
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,870
he left to avoid the creditors.

835
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,710
Creditors?

836
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,100
He's a gambler

837
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,150
and is in a lot of debt.

838
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,310
The creditors will come to him anytime.

839
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,470
He had to run away,

840
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,630
or he might die.

841
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,030
Before Long Fa left home,

842
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,870
you two had been living in this house?

843
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,180
Yes.

844
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,600
When did he leave?

845
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,390
When did you move out?

846
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,320
Three days ago,

847
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,300
he said he would leave at dusk.

848
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,310
I moved to

849
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,320
the dyeing workshop at 3 p.m.

850
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,890
The neighbors can testify for me.

851
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,160
Why did you want to rent out the house?

852
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,220
Long Fa told me to do it.

853
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,260
His fur store has been taken away by the creditors.

854
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,030
He said

855
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,350
as long as someone else moves in,

856
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,640
even if the creditors come to the door,

857
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,190
it won't be easy for them

858
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,750
to take the house.

859
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,580
Before Long Fa disappeared,

860
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,660
did he do anything unusual?

861
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,510
Or

862
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,620
did he meet anyone?

863
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,350
How many properties does Long Fa have?

864
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,730
Besides the fur store,

865
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,550
the property agency, and the dyeing workshop,

866
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,470
there are three more houses.

867
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,330
He gambled away two of them.

868
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,790
Only this mansion is left.

869
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,350
There's also a bone yard

870
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,870
where he skinned the hunted animals

871
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,310
and kept their bones.

872
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,950
It's not small,

873
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,990
but it's located in a remote corner of the city.

874
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,480
It's not worth much.

875
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,020
If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving.

876
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,110
Cao Shuangli.

877
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,990
The rent is here.

878
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:55,830
The total is…

879
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,590
Shut up!

880
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,410
It's such a nice house.

881
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,730
You rented it short-term for just 1,500 coins?

882
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,590
I can't believe you run a property agency.

883
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,910
You can go to hell!

884
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,990
Calm down.

885
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,630
Song Ami is not so simple.

886
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,590
Are we just letting her go?

887
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,720
I observed her expression.

888
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,750
She seemed to have anticipated

889
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,630
the murder,

890
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,030
but the person who died

891
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,160
was not the one she expected.

892
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,570
The cloth wrapping this silver ingot

893
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,190
is from her dyeing workshop.

894
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,770
I'll stalk her.

895
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,630
You don't like her, do you?

896
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:36,970
I'll stalk her.

897
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,750
Don't follow me!

898
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,060

00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,670
What are you here for?

901
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,460
What else can I come here for?

902
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,230
For fun, of course.

903
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,750
I've come to the right place, haven't I?

904
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,030
You need to ask?

905
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,540
In Jiufang Pavilion,

906
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,660
there are all kinds of fun you want.

907
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:45,620
Tell me.

908
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,160
I saw a woman go in just now.

909
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,920
What kind of fun is she here for?

910
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,000
She probably went to Liaoshi Hall.

911
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,800
The other day, she came here too.

912
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,150

00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,190

918
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,270
The one who died was that assassin?

Are you sure?

920
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,230
Yes!

Nothing like this has ever happened before.

Besides,

924
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,990
how could he possibly fail?

925
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,640
He never failed before?

926
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,430
Do you know him very well?

927
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,660
You said he was from the Taiyin Sect.

928
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,120
Was he really an assassin?

929
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,230
Why do I feel

930
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,890
he was as dumb as a butcher?

955
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,670
Let go of me!

956
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,240
Song Ami!

957
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,740
How dare you cheat on me!
