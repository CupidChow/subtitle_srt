[Episode 32]

4
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,229
Send Heitou's confession

5
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,830
to Hanzhou and Shazhou immediately

6
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,750
and ask for their cooperative investigation.

7
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,190
Yes.

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,020
Go to the place Heitou mentioned

9
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,110
to search for the goods.

10
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,509
Yes.

11
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,030
Sheriff Lu.

12
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,590
I didn't expect

13
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,510
that you

14
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,200
accidentally caught

15
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,070
such a heinous criminal.

16
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,590
Congratulations.

17
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,630
This is a great achievement.

18
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,430
I haven't even figured out

19
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,960
the cause of Li Yun's death.

20
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,230
What's there to congratulate me on?

21
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,660
Just now, in front of Fed,

22
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,140
I already admitted

23
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,840
I am an incompetent person.

24
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,790
If you're still angry,

25
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,680
tonight,

26
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,380
in front of Xijun, Yingtao,

27
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,060
and Fed,

28
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,920
I will shout three more times

29
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,350
that Su Wuming is an incompetent person.

30
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,070
What do you think?

31
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,120
Don't think I'm trying to get back at you.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,340
I'm not that petty.

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
It's just that...

34
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,520
this case is truly bizarre.

35
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,190
Indeed.

36
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,120
There are too many suspects.

37
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,150
But it doesn't matter.

38
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,600
As long as we find them

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,520
one by one,

40
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,290
I believe we can definitely solve this case.

41
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,150
Su Wuming.

42
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,080
Lu Lingfeng.

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,850
You finished drawing?

44
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,550
So soon?

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,710
They are just rough sketches.

46
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,030
I hope they can be helpful.

47
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,760
They will be.

48
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,180
When Ms. Yin saw them,

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,520
she said the portraits are so vivid.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,320
She thought Xijun was a goddess.

51
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,270
Actually, I'm thinking

52
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,550
if more constables

53
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,150
in prefectures and counties

54
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,510
can have a painter to work with them,

55
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,550
that would be great.

56
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,750
Are you making a suggestion to the court

57
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,010
or praising yourself?

58
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,990
Both, I guess.

59
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,910
The portrait I drew was approved by the person depicted.

60
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,300
Can I... be proud of myself?

61
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,400
Of course you should be proud.

62
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,710
I think

63
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,710
your suggestion

64
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,820
is very good.

65
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,910
Someday in the future,

66
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,990
it might really become reality.

67
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,090
Then we should ask more people

68
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,720
to enjoy the works

69
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,680
of the future best painter of Tang.

70
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,360
This guy.

71
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,150
I think I saw him

72
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,650
on the street two days ago.

73
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,030
How certain are you?

74
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,630
I can't be completely certain.

75
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,990
Paste this portrait

76
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,720
on the wall at the street corner now.

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,870
If the person in the portrait is still in Yunding,

78
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,230
don't let him leave the county.

79
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,630
Yes.

80
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,290
I've seen this person.

81
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,230
That day...

82
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,550
They look alike.

83
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,290
They look very much alike.

84
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,040
At first, I didn't pay attention.

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,170
Later, I noticed...

86
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,000
At that time, I thought

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,780
rich men indeed know how to have fun.

88
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,880
They came outside

89
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,940
instead of enjoying dances

90
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,990
in brothels.

91
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,140
And that woman

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,190
just let these two men

93
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,390
look at her from afar.

94
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,030
I wonder how much money she asked them for.

95
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,090
Have you seen this kind of scene before

96
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,830
on the street of Yunding?

97
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:53,950
No.

98
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,350
It was the first time.

99
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,380
What about you guys?

100
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,120
-No.
-No.

101
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,300
When did this happen?

102
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,840
Not long ago.

103
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,370
Three days ago?

104
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,470
No.

105
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,270
The day before yesterday.

106
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,190
Two days ago?

107
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,800
Mudan.

108
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,030
You know her?

109
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,560
Yes.

110
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,370
It really is Mudan.

111
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,150
The portrait is so vivid.

112
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,990
It's just that...

113
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,310
the girl in the portrait is more beautiful than she really is.

114
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,710
Mudan is very beautiful.

115
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,590
The portrait doesn't capture how coquettish she is in real life.

116
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,390
Stop arguing.

117
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,830
Which of you is close to her?

118
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
Go bring her here.

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
You thief, villain,

120
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,590
murderer!

121
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,100
[Mudan]

122
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,680
You lied to me by saying

123
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,720
you were a descendant of a noble family

124
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,750
and became a kiln worker after coming down in the world.

125
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,610
I didn't expect

126
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,440
that you killed so many people!

127
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,360
What bad luck!

128
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,190
Stop!

129
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,830
I asked you to bring her here.

130
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,870
Why didn't you keep your mouth shut?

131
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,870
Don't blame him.

132
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,650
We're old acquaintances.

133
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,420
Of course he'd tell me what's going on.

134
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,350
Besides,

135
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,400
if he didn't say it clearly,

136
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,140
I wouldn't have come here.

137
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,310
It's my fault.

138
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,410
I was blinded by him.

139
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,600
He looks strong.

140
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,330
I thought he was an honest man.

141
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,210
I didn't expect

142
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,640
that he would kill and rob someone!

143
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,030
It really scares me.

144
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,980
Sheriff Lu,

145
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,830
we found these

146
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,950
in the stove

147
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,770
in the house where Heitou lives.

148
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,420
You're this wealthy?

149
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
Then why did you use my money?

150
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,990
You heartless bastard!

151
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,320
Except this silver ingot,

152
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,690
the rest of these

153
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,230
were obtained by killing and robbing others.

154
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,230
If you use them, won't you be scared?

155
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,330
Luckily, I've never spent a penny of his.

156
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,240
Mudan,

157
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,670
let me ask you.

158
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,510
When did he arrive

159
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,750
at Biluo Inn yesterday?

160
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,680
He's a drunkard.

161
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,860
He drank until midnight every day.

162
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,380
I think...

163
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,480
he arrived at my place at 11:00 p.m.

164
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,860
Right?

165
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,110
Yes.

166
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,710
Look.

167
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,270
What I said is true.

168
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,840
Shut up!

169
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,640
What time did he leave your room

170
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,590
in the morning?

171
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,430
When he left...

172
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,110
I think... it was just after dawn.

173
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,330
Before that,

174
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,830
had Heitou ever left your room?

175
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,200
Absolutely not!

176
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,830
If he left halfway,

177
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,790
what good is my charm?

178
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,800
What Mudan said

179
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,160
matches

180
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,730
Heitou's confession.

181
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,920
Li Yun died sometime between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m.

182
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,410
The time doesn't match up.

183
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,350
Put Heitou

184
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,560
in Yunding Prison!

185
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,140
-Yes!
-Yes!

186
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,750
Wait.

187
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,760
I have something to say.

188
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,150
Be honest.

189
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,470
Mudan,

190
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,130
I said I will marry you.

191
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,820
I meant it.

192
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,740
[Yunding County Office]

193
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,830
Sheriff Lu, you're walking me out.

194
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,910
No need for this.

195
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,190
Madam.

196
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,850
Who are you calling Madam?

197
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,520
I'm a young lady.

198
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,030
Miss Mudan,

199
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,610
you are unmarried,

200
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,470
but...

201
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,550
But what?

202
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,430
As long as it's not something

203
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,960
forbidden by the Tang Code,

204
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,110
I can do it.

205
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,610
I didn't say you violated the law.

206
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,590
But you can't continue

207
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,520
to muddle along.

208
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,930
It's too dangerous

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,230
to associate with someone like Heitou.

210
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,290
Moreover, you are an appealing girl.

211
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,160
You deserve a decent life

212
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,480
and a bright future.

213
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,310
Live up to your name.

214
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,830
You...

215
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,970
I...

216
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,470
You said I'm an appealing girl?

217
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,970
How come I don't feel that way myself?

218
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,510
I'm sorry, Sheriff Lu.

219
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,270
I didn't speak properly just now.

220
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,390
Sheriff Lu,

221
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,430
I'm very grateful

222
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,210
for your pearls of wisdom.

223
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,790
I will keep that in mind.

224
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,390
Do you have a proper livelihood?

225
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:06,830
Yes.

226
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,950
I run a shop.

227
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,040
That's good.

228
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,170
I wish your business prosperity.

229
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,190
I believe in you.

230
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,030
In the future,

231
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,440
you will find someone perfect for you.

232
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,960
Sheriff, thank you.

233
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,430
Now,

234
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,450
we are acquaintances, right?

235
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,110
If I see you when I drink at the night market in the future,

236
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,070
I will make a toast to you

237
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,400
with three cups of wine.

238
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,620
Sheriff Lu, when you investigate a case,

239
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,270
you don't just focus on the case itself.

240
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,230
You do whatever you can to cure and save people.

241
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,110
I really admire you.

242
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,150
Stop flattering me.

243
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,870
I still don't know

244
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,350
what to do next.

245
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,460
I know I was wrong.

246
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,350
I really shouldn't have laughed.

247
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,270
Yingtao and I are going back to cook now

248
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,200
as a punishment.

249
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,510
You laughed in the court.

250
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,310
Indeed, you should be punished.

251
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,070
But...

252
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,550
you finished drawing the portraits.

253
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,670
That can be counted as a contribution.

254
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,750
Your fault can be offset by your contribution.

255
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,080
No need to cook tonight.

256
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,270
Let's go eat at the night market.

257
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,990
My treat.

258
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,140
Great.

259
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,470
I just received my monthly salary today.

260
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,560
Ask Fed

261
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,350
to have a hearty meal with us.

262
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,620
You guys decide

263
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,800
what we eat tonight.

264
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,830
Girls,

265
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,880
this is a rare opportunity.

266
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,650
So take full advantage of it.

267
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,080
We should go to a restaurant

268
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,070
with the most delicious food

269
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,310
to put him to a lot of expense.

270
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,830
It doesn't matter if the food is delicious or not.

271
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,390
The point is we should order something expensive.

272
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,190
That's right.

273
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,920
Who asked him to always glare at us to scare us?

274
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,710
Hunting the suspect.

275
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,510
They even put a bounty on him.

276
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,250
[Li Men]

277
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:07,870
Li Men?

278
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,460
I don't know him.

279
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,910
Who is he?

280
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,150
Stop right there!

281
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,870
I have no idea.

282
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,380
Bounty?

283
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,050
Your qinggong is impressive.

284
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,620
I don't know how to use qinggong at all.

285
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,790
If you don't know how to use qinggong,

286
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,800
why are you so skilled at climbing over walls?

287
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,930
Climb over the wall.

288
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,750
Climb over the wall.

289
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,150
Get out.

290
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,490
Go back.

291
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,690
Get out.

292
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,590
Go back.

293
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,250
Get out.

294
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:14,830
Speak!

295
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,110
I am from Hanzhou.

296
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,770
I no longer have

297
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,070
a means of making a living in my hometown.

298
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,930
So I want to try my luck in Shazhou.

299
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,460
I arrived in Yunding early in the morning the day before yesterday.

300
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,120
I didn't have much money left.

301
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,870
I was worried I would starve to death on my way west.

302
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,030
So I thought of my cousin, Li Yun.

303
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,190
So you wrote him a letter.

304
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,070
Letter?

305
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,480
What letter?

306
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,470
You didn't write a letter to Li Yun

307
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,240
to tell him you came to Yunding?

308
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,790
What's the point of writing a letter to him?

309
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,590
A few years ago, when I passed through Yunding,

310
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,990
I stopped by his house.

311
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,570
But he didn't let me stay at his place.

312
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,600
I had to

313
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,870
stay in an inn.

314
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,590
When he came to see me,

315
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,590
he only brought two pepper buns.

316
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,010
Why would I write him a letter?

317
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,870
I just wanted to go

318
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,650
to his fabric shop at night.

319
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,830
You wanted to steal from him?

320
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,080
I did think about it.

321
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,590
But before I went there,

322
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,210
he came to Biluo Inn.

323
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,320
Cousin?

324
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,860
Li Men?

325
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,830
You didn't write a letter to Li Yun.

326
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,540
So

327
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,900
when you saw him in Biluo Inn,

328
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,710
you were quite surprised.

329
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,310
Yes.

330
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,910
I even asked him,

331
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,730
"How did you know

332
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,630
I live here?"

333
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm very close to the soldiers at the city gate.

334
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,770
They told me

335
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,080
you came to Yunding.

336
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,220
But how would the soldiers at the city gate

337
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,410
know who I am?

338
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,470
When we were drinking, I told them

339
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,590
I have a cousin.

340
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,950
So you care so much

341
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,950
about me.

342
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,310
I misunderstood.

343
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,510
Your room is dark and damp.

344
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,230
The smell is really unpleasant.

345
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,090
I'm going back.

346
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:02,990
Cousin.

347
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,670
You didn't come all the way

348
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,990
to Shangxian Lane

349
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,280
just to see me, right?

350
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,860
I did.

351
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,430
I already saw you.

352
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm leaving.

353
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,070
Well...

354
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,470
No need to walk me out.

355
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,750
Don't leave this room.

356
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,590
Cousin.

357
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,030
To be honest with you,

358
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,750
I said I was just passing through Yunding.

359
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,050
But the truth is I have nowhere else to go.

360
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,550
Could you please

361
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,750
help me?

362
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,270
I asked him to lend me some money.

363
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,230
But he said he was obsessed with cockfighting.

364
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,360
He said he lost a lot of money and wouldn't lend me a penny.

365
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,870
After he left, I thought

366
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
he definitely didn't come to see me.

367
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,730
At that time, I heard

368
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,030
footsteps going upstairs.

369
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,830
When I checked in, I already knew

370
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,710
men and women in this county would often

371
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,910
go to this kind of family inn for trysts.

372
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,790
So I wanted to find out

373
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,930
who he went to meet

374
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,990
and then go to his house

375
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,110
to tell his wife.

376
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,950
Honey.

377
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,950
You followed me here.

378
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,840
You came here to have a tryst with a strange woman.

379
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,110
I'm going to tell Shen Ping.

380
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,600
Don't.

381
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,570
You want me to keep it a secret for you?

382
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,240
Give me five silver ingots.

383
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,950
I want to go to Shazhou to explore a cave.

384
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,670
After that, I can definitely support myself

385
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,390
and I'll never come back to you again.

386
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,710
Five silver ingots?

387
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,830
Are you crazy?

388
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,850
What's wrong with that?

389
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,110
Your father-in-law left you

390
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,950
the biggest fabric shop in Yunding.

391
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,230
Just five silver ingots.

392
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,830
Is it a lot?

393
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,160
You won't give it to me, right?

394
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,510
If you won't,

395
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,510
I'll make you lose all your reputation!

396
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,390
How dare you!

397
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,980
How dare you blackmail me!

398
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,440
How dare you blackmail me!

399
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,990
How dare you!

400
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,589
You bastard.

401
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,140
You're a good-for-nothing who can't even afford a meal.

402
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,170
How dare you blackmail me!

403
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,430
I am blackmailing you!

404
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,859
If you don't give me the money today,

405
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,750
I'll make sure everyone in this county

406
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,910
knows about this!

407
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,550
Chu Bin!

408
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,970
A ghost!

409
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,190
What's wrong?

410
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,550
You look so scared.

411
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,670
Did you see a ghost?

412
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,110
Chu Bin?

413
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,910
Yes.

414
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,410
She died ten years ago.

415
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,370
When she was alive,

416
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,830
was she very close to you?

417
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,630
She was Li Yun's former wife.

418
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,190
No.

419
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,190
They never had a formal wedding ceremony.

420
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,110
But when Chu Bin was alive,

421
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,510
she loved wearing a veil.

422
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,030
What I saw last night

423
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,250
really is a female ghost.

424
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,640
She looked exactly the same

425
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
as Chu Bin when she was alive.

426
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:35,910
Li Men,

427
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,990
get up.

428
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,110
Come.

429
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,500
Get up.

430
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,520
My legs are numb.

431
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,270
Tell us everything

432
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,030
you know.

433
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,950
Thank you.

434
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,630
At that time,

435
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,790
my parents were still alive.

436
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,850
My family was rich.

437
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,500
So I often came to Yunding to have fun.

438
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,720
Cousin?

439
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,020
Li Men?

440
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,470
Cousin,

441
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,110
this is...

442
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,270
Are you married?

443
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,910
Why didn't you write a letter to my father to tell us about it?

444
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,970
Her name is Chu Bin.

445
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,350
She came to Yunding from Dongdu with me.

446
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,070
Marriage is significant

447
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,270
and requires careful consideration.

448
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,400
If we really plan to get married,

449
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,060
I will write a letter to your father

450
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,870
and invite him

451
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,110
to officiate at our wedding in Yunding.

452
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,390
That's more like it.

453
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,230
Chu Bin.

454
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,810
My future sister-in-law.

455
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm Li Men.

456
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,750
Greetings.

457
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,760
Nice to meet you, Mr. Li.

458
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,670
Come, Cousin.

459
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,050
Chu Bin is such a good cook.

460
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,070
You're lucky.

461
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,520
Apart from cooking,

462
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,780
she knows how to write too.

463
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,310
Really?

464
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,270
Come.

465
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,230
By copying books for the bookstore,

466
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,290
she can make a lot of money each month.

467
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,650
Have a seat, Mr. Li.

468
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,190
You finally have a chance to meet each other.

469
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,190
You should drink and chat all night.

470
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,920
I won't disturb you.

471
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,970
She is such a beautiful and virtuous woman.

472
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,710
Cousin,

473
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,640
you're really something.

474
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,010
One year later,

475
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,640
namely ten years ago,

476
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,640
I remember it was also this season.

477
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
That day was the Cold Food Festival.

478
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,480
I came to Yunding again.

479
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,820
Cousin.

480
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,430
Cousin, you're here.

481
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,390
Whose coffin is this?

482
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,470
Chu Bin's.

483
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,630
Do you know

484
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,430
how Chu Bin died?

485
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,050
Li Yun said she

486
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,810
died of a sudden acute illness.

487
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,350
But Chu Bin was so young.

488
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,220
What acute illness could she have?

489
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,240
I think she died

490
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,750
because Li Yun

491
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,750
had a new lover.

492
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,290
What a pity. Chu Bin

493
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,350
was a graceful and virtuous lady.

494
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,610
She was also talented.

495
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,470
She was born in Dongdu, but died in Yunding.

496
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,350
Right,

497
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,540
why did you arrest me?

498
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,240
What crime did I commit?

499
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,060
If you're innocent, why were you running?

500
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,120
You pasted my portrait on the street.

501
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,510
I...

502
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,230
I felt nervous.

503
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,870
You felt nervous because you killed Li Yun!

504
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,270
You...

505
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,150
What?

506
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,270
Li Yun is dead?

507
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,610
It must be Chu Bin's ghost

508
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,690
that took his life.

509
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,890
This further proves my speculation.

510
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,200
Then tell us about your speculation.

511
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,170
Your Honor,

512
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,270
ten years ago, I already felt

513
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,950
Chu Bin's death was very suspicious.

514
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,910
Now that I think about it,

515
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,910
I think Li Yun

516
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,430
killed Chu Bin

517
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,110
in order to marry Shen Ping successfully.

518
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,790
You can't make a wild guess

519
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,950
at this kind of thing.

520
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,870
It's not a wild guess.

521
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,590
After they returned to Yunding,

522
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,000
Li Yun met Shen Ping

523
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,150
when he was learning the craft of tailoring.

524
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,830
Then he grew tired of Chu Bin and fell in love with Shen Ping.

525
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,670
Chu Bin wrote me a letter

526
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,870
to tell me about this.

527
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,910
I could feel how heartbroken she was from each word she wrote.

528
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,250
It's been ten years since this happened.

529
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,050
But the letter is still in my bag.

530
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,250
Where is my bag?

531
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,230
Mr. Li Men,

532
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,710
I apologize

533
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,030
for writing a letter to you suddenly.

534
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,390
Let me explain.

535
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,630
Li Yun is about to let me down.

536
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,720
I hope you have time

537
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,070
to hear my story now.

538
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,590
Recently, Li Yun has been learning the craft of tailoring in a fabric shop.

539
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,340
He met the shop owner's daughter, Shen Ping.

540
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,800
So he has become more distant from me.

541
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,960
But I also know

542
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,340
we need money

543
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,630
to live our lives.

544
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,100
It'll be difficult if we don't have a skill

545
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,850
to making a living.

546
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,480
So I can't stop him from learning the craft.

547
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,670
If I don't stop him,

548
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,630
Li Yun and Shen Ping will become a couple.

549
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,670
Then I'll be alone.

550
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,340
It'll be a challenge to me too.

551
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,290
You know I love Li Yun very much.

552
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,980
I don't want to let him go.

553
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,810
Could you please help me

554
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,550
persuade Li Yun to change his mind?

555
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,410
Thank you. Thank you again.

556
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,270
Chu Bin.

557
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,130
This letter does look like something from ten years ago.

558
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,220
[Qiongquan Alley]

559
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,670
[Biluo Inn]

560
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,850
Sheriff Lu,

561
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,620
Mr. Su,

562
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,630
Li Men doesn't know martial arts.

563
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,860
I've seen him

564
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,200
climb over walls myself.

565
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,710
If he wants to climb down from here,

566
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,590
to him,

567
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,410
it wouldn't be difficult.

568
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,260
If he had to climb down

569
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
from this height,

570
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,150
unless he encountered a ghost

571
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
and got scared...

572
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,880
You two, please make way.

573
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,950
Sir,

574
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,390
did you encounter someone last night

575
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,990
who climbed down from above?

576
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,880
Yes, indeed.

577
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,550
He looked flustered,

578
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,390
as if he had just seen a ghost.

579
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,220
Ms. Yin sells joss paper

580
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,030
and runs this private inn.

581
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,710
All the wandering ghosts and spirits

582
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,510
should be fighting to stay here.

583
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,960
Take a look.

584
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,550
Is it this the person?

585
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,010
That's him.

586
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,270
Do you remember what time it was?

587
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,070
It was just getting dark.

588
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,600
As for me,

589
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,430
I don't set up my stall at night.

590
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,750
I had just packed up and was heading back.

591
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,000
Around 7 to 9 p.m.?

592
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,440
Yes.

593
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,700
It was at about 7 p.m..

594
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:17,790
Alright.

595
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,320
Thank you very much.

596
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,330
I wish you a prosperous business.

597
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,880
When Li Men climbed down from above,

598
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,550
it was at about 7 p.m..

599
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,590
We also happened to run into a witness.

600
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,720
But Li Yun died within 9 to 11 p.m..

601
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,250
The timing doesn't match.

602
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,580
Well, I wouldn't rule out the possibility

603
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,910
that Li Men came back to commit the murder.

604
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,000
As Li Men was evasive with his words,

605
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,340
it indeed raises more suspicion.

606
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,670
Let's go back and interrogate him further.

607
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,630
Li Men.

608
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,950
After escaping from Biluo Inn,

609
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,080
where did you go?

610
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,390
I didn't go anywhere.

611
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,920
Suo Long.

612
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,120
Mr. Li

613
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,590
doesn't want to confess the truth.

614
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,270
According to the county government's rules,

615
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,270
what should we do?

616
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,410
Drag him out

617
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,350
and give him 20 lashes first.

618
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,030
No, no, no.

619
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,990
I'll tell you.

620
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,190
I went to Tianyi Fabric Shop.

621
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,750
You've already caught Li Yun's weakness,

622
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,590
so you went to

623
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,820
blackmail him?

624
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,910
Dear customer,

625
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,760
we are closed.

626
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,020
If you want to make clothes, please come back tomorrow.

627
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,430
Yes, young man.

628
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,230
It's too dark to see clearly.

629
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,470
It would be no good

630
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,260
if you make a mistake

631
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,790
when choosing your fabric.

632
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,030
With how poor I look,

633
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,320
do I look like I can afford new clothes?

634
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,880
I want to see Shen Ping.

635
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,270
Mr. Li.

636
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,500
Madam had just gone to bed.

637
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,150
She's asleep?

638
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,990
So early?

639
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,990
It doesn't bother her

640
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,270
that her husband is still out?

641
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,310
For the past year,

642
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,610
my madam's health has been very frail.

643
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,070
Even eating a meal exhausts her.

644
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,350
But she won't be asleep for long.

645
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,280
She'll wake up in two hours at most.

646
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,550
But... I dare not wake her up now.

647
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,490
If she gets startled,

648
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,670
it would be a sin.

649
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,270
Two hours.

650
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,800
Fine, I'll wait for her.

651
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,470
I am Li Yun's cousin.

652
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,830
Aren't you guys going to

653
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,830
prepare some food and drinks for me?

654
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,210
Don't make me wait with an empty stomach.

655
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,070
I ate and drank my fill and waited.

656
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,630
I waited until

657
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,990
12 midnight.

658
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,820
It's really my cousin.

659
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,680
Sister-in-law.

660
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,290
It's only been a few years.

661
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,910
How did you become so ill?

662
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,790
After turning 30,

663
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,910
I've been getting worse day by day.

664
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,080
Brother,

665
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,570
sorry to keep you waiting.

666
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,590
Didn't Li Yun went to find you?

667
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,030
You two brothers

668
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,420
didn't meet each other?

669
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,480
Li Yun had no intention

670
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,610
to look for me at all.

671
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,040
It seems you guys had a fight.

672
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,360
No matter how much you argue or fight,

673
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,750
you're still family.

674
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,150
Don't hold grudges, okay?

675
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,910
He really didn't come looking for me.

676
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,440
There was a letter from you.

677
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,580
Master only left after reading your letter.

678
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,470
If he hadn't looked for you,

679
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,790
then who was he looking for?

680
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,190
I never wrote any letter.

681
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,140
Was it my handwriting on the letter?

682
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,110
I can't read.

683
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,610
Did you read the letter, sister-in-law?

684
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,410
Your cousin didn't show it to me.

685
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,120
Well, there you have it.

686
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,260
He has a guilty conscience.

687
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Of course he wouldn't show it to you.

688
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,500
I did indeed

689
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,660
run into him at the inn I was staying at.

690
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,200
But he...

691
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,290
Sister-in-law, please have your servant leave first.

692
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,330
After all, he is my cousin.

693
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,040
For the sake of my uncle's dignity,

694
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,920
I can't let him

695
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,310
disgrace himself in front of the servants.

696
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,510
But my cousin-in-law Shen Ping, she...

697
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,670
Brother.

698
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,870
It's not that I want to reprimand you.

699
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,750
You and my husband bear the same surname.

700
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,480
How could you not be on his side?

701
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,470
What do you mean?

702
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,360
You shouldn't have said

703
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,650
what you said just now.

704
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,920
You definitely shouldn't have said it in front of me.

705
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,950
You're poor

706
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,150
and you wanted my family to help you.

707
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,740
Your cousin felt exasperated towards you.

708
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,670
He was mad at you,

709
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,780
so he didn't give you any money.

710
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,150
No, I...

711
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,410
It's also my fault.

712
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,410
When I went out,

713
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,830
I only gave him a small silver ingot.

714
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,870
Wait here.

715
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,660
Take these two silver ingots

716
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,470
and leave.

717
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,150
I considered you a relative.

718
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,350
But you said such

719
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,750
awful things about my husband.

720
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,590
Don't ever

721
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,920
come to our house again.

722
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,570
Sister-in-law.

723
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,950
I...

724
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,190
Mr. Li.

725
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,560
It's time to leave.

726
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,210
That was given to me by Shen Ping.

727
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,130
Whether I can turn the remaining of my life around,

728
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,550
depends on these two silver ingots.

729
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,170
You guys must not

730
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,030
take them away.

731
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,140
Are you referring to

732
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,140
these two ingots?

733
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,590
Yes, yes.

734
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,070
Bring out the stolen goods from Heitou's place

735
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,000
for comparison.

736
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,690
[Tianyi Fabric Shop]

737
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,920
These silver ingots

738
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,450
were left to me by my father.

739
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,470
All of them aren't big.

740
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,430
It's just for the fabric shop's convenience.

741
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,960
Today at the county government,

742
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,220
why didn't you mention

743
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,680
the matter of Li Men getting blackmailed?

744
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,830
That's not exactly blackmail, is it?

745
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,030
When you have such poor relatives,

746
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,290
it's inevitable to lose a bit of fortune.

747
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,950
It's also a way to share my husband's burden.

748
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,950
Besides,

749
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,990
one mustn't air dirty laundry in public.

750
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,350
Madam, you are virtuous,

751
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,280
but perhaps a little too virtuous.

752
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,060
At what time did Li Men leave?

753
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,290
Around 11 p.m..

754
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,470
When I sent him out,

755
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,160
I heard the night watchman.

756
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,130
[County]

757
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,620
The testimonies from Li Men

758
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,710
and the master and servant of Tianyi Fabric Shop

759
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,910
indeed corroborate.

760
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,530
As you deduced,

761
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,380
Li Yun died between 9 to 11 p.m..

762
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,160
If so, Li Men

763
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,470
didn't have time to commit the crime.

764
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,310
Yes.

765
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,590
But I still need to detain Li Men

766
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,710
at Yunding Prison

767
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,470
until the truth is revealed.

768
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,150
What for?

769
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,490
Sheriff Lu.

770
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,840
Li Men said

771
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,870
he once hit Li Yun with a candlestick.

772
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,500
It happened on the second floor,

773
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,030
but in the room on the second floor,

774
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,830
we couldn't find this said candlestick.

775
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,550
However, Xijun found it

776
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,150
in the room on the first floor

777
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,420
where Li Men lived.

778
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,390
So, it's possible that

779
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,870
after the murderer killed the victim,

780
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,910
he rearranged the crime scene.

781
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,500
Sheriff Lu.

782
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,790
You had investigated the murder scene

783
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,430
so thoroughly.

784
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,220
I am indeed impressed.

785
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,600
Alright,

786
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,800
stop praising me like this.

787
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,640
You aren't trying to ask me to give you

788
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,990
your monthly salary as soon as possible, are you?

789
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,720
I, Su Wuming,

790
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,450
has this exact intention.

791
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,280
Then why don't you analyze this case at once?

792
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,210
You think you get paid for nothing?

793
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,590
Currently,

794
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,960
there are two other suspects.

795
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,970
One is that veiled woman,

796
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,930
and the other

797
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,590
is that ugly woman.

798
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:53,950
Sheriff Lu!

799
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,090
Sheriff Lu!

800
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,350
The veiled woman has been found.

801
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,830
Where?

802
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,230
Anyuan Inn.

803
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,970
[Anyuan Inn]

804
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,340
Mr. Xu.

805
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,240
How is it?

806
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,350
It's amazing.

807
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,150
Amazing!

808
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,150
She can really transform into my cousin.

809
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,750
Moreover,

810
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,650
it's exactly how my cousin looked

811
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,910
when I was 16 years old.

812
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,680
After all these years, I finally get to see her again.

813
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,440
I can die without regrets now.

814
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,110
Then Mr. Xu, you can now rekindle your old flames,

815
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,550
and renew your love affair.

816
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,350
Despicable!

817
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,110
Back then, my cousin and I

818
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,790
were completely innocent.

819
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,240
Then, you didn't spend these

820
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,470
few silver ingots in vain.

821
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,350
Look at how petty you are.

822
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,100
So vulgar.

823
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,840
How unbearably vulgar!

824
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,450
Gentlemen,

825
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,330
this way.

826
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,260
It's this room.

827
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,960
The person is inside.

828
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,310
She claims to be seeing a client.

829
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,710
Who is it?

830
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,070
A client.

831
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,880
How could you be a client

832
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,290
when you didn't make an appointment?

833
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,310
Yunding County's sheriff investigating a case.

834
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,570
Open the door quickly.

835
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,860
My name is Lin Bei.

836
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,590
[Lin Bei]

837
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,949
I live near Beimang Mountain in Dongdu.

838
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,560
I came to Yunding

839
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,489
exactly one month ago.

840
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,639
As for what I came here to do,

841
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,350
if you two

842
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,710
had encountered

843
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,190
Mr. Xu who just left,

844
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,389
you should already know.

845
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,190
That day, I went to the Biluo Inn.

846
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,510
I heard fighting sounds

847
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,970
coming from another room.

848
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,830
So I took a lamp to take a look.

849
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,770
It turned out to be two men.

850
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,770
One of them saw me and said,

851
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,030
"Chu Bin?

852
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,430
A ghost!"

853
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
He seemed to have really saw a ghost.

854
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,390
He actually jumped out of the window and fled.

855
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,650
As for the other guy...

856
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,550
Chu Bin.

857
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,260
It's been ten years.

858
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,610
We've been separated by death.

859
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,950
How have you been?

860
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,730
I know Chu Bin is also from Dongdu.

861
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,650
Otherwise,

862
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,560
I wouldn't have taken this job.

863
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,850
I disguised myself as Chu Bin to meet him,

864
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,110
in order to relieve him from his longing.

865
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,410
Unexpectedly,

866
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,880
he didn't come to see me after arriving at the inn.

867
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,400
Instead, he got into a fight

868
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,670
with a man in another room.

869
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,260
How very annoying.

870
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,190
I was displeased, so I left.

871
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
In order to see you,

872
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,990
an appointment needs to be made in advance.

873
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,070
If so,

874
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,060
how did Li Yun make an appointment?

875
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,790
It was through another person.

876
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,420
His friend.

877
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,620
Peck it!

878
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:17,950
Wang Chong!

879
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,350
Peck!

880
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,230
In one go!

881
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,070
-Peck!
-Peck!

882
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,950
-Peck!
-Peck!

883
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,670
Peck it!

884
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,550
Liu Heita!

885
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,230
Peck it for me!

886
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,510
-Peck!
-Peck!

887
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,070
Peck it!

888
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,020
Peck it!

889
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:29,900
-Peck!
-Good!

890
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,970
Don't be scared just because

891
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,230
-of its name!
-Peck it!

892
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,180
Peck it!

893
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,030
Peck it!

894
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,270
My Liu Heita defeated Wang Chong.

895
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,470
Pay up.

896
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,830
You're Fang Jiong?

897
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,830
That's me.

898
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,180
Here to challenge me?

899
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,350
Let's see what kind of chicken you have first.

900
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,330
Not just any opponent

901
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,730
is worthy of fighting me,

902
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,810
the great Mr. Liu.

903
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,550
Who's looking to fight chickens with you?

904
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,350
This is our county's Sheriff Lu.

905
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,340
Defeating a group of demons with a single sword

906
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,170
and eradicating the evil villains of Yunding Immortal Steps

907
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,170
in one fell swoop.

908
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,800
Your glorious reputation precedes you.

909
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,870
[Yunding merchant: Fang Jiong]

910
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,690
I'm Fang Jiong.

911
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,670
Greetings, Sheriff Lu.

912
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,900
Fang, you flatter me.

913
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,040
I've heard you're highly skilled

914
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
in cockfighting.

915
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,710
Let's go

916
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,820
find somewhere quiet to chat.

917
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,690
[Yunding County Government Office]

918
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,310
Do you know

919
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,630
cockfighting is mostly related to gambling?

920
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,110
I know.

921
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,500
It's against public order and morality.

922
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,420
But it doesn't violate the Tang Code.

923
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,950
Don't the royals also fight chickens often?

924
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,870
If you think it's inappropriate,

925
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,240
I won't do it anymore.

926
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,840
I asked you to come today

927
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,770
not because of cockfighting.

928
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,190
Then it must be about Li Yun.

929
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,840
Li Yun and I have been pals for many years.

930
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,760
Shen Ping has already gone to identify the body.

931
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,730
How could I not know

932
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,970
about his death?

933
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,730
A good friend has passed away,

934
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,880
but you don't seem sad at all.

935
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,760
I was sad,

936
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,490
but I can't be sad all the time.

937
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,460
That'd really hurt my health.

938
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,970
After hearing the news,

939
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,180
I had a good cry,

940
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,850
then wiped my tears and went to fight chickens.

941
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,910
Perhaps this is how

942
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,350
celebrated scholars should be.

943
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,060
Besides,

944
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,630
life is about seizing the day and enjoying the present,

945
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,030
right?

946
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,030
If one day I end up like Li Yun,

947
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,180
suffering a death

948
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,420
that's not clarified

949
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,330
and leaving behind many regrets,

950
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,160
wouldn't that be a wasted life?

951
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,970
Fang, you are so carefree.

952
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,530
Now that Li Yun's dead,

953
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,890
how'd he have regrets?

954
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,430
Actually, I think

955
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,150
he'd already resolved his regrets.

956
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,480
What do you mean by that?

957
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,950
These days, he often mentioned to me

958
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,110
about Chu Bin's sudden death from illness ten years ago.

959
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,910
As he got older,

960
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,950
his longing for Chu Bin

961
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,350
got more and more intense.

962
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,540
He thought about her day and night,

963
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,150
all day every day.

964
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,750
He said if he could see Chu Bin again

965
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,680
even just once

966
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,560
to be intimate with her, he'd die without regret.

967
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,600
And now...

968
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,570
he really died.

969
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,030
It seems he went to the underworld

970
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,360
to reunite with Chu Bin.

971
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,430
So you mean

972
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,960
you know a lot about

973
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,970
Chu Bin and Li Yun's story?

974
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,490
Li Yun and I studied together

975
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,630
for a while.

976
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,960
We were classmates.

977
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,380
Unfortunately, neither of us studied hard.

978
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,440
So we didn't pass the imperial exams.

979
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,600
We agreed to leave Yunding

980
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,040
and make a living in Chang'an.

981
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,710
But the cost of living in Chang'an was high.

982
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,950
How could people like us

983
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,810
survive there?

984
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,550
So I returned to Yunding,

985
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,150
while he went to Dongdu.

986
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,970
Two years later, he brought Chu Bin back.

987
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,760
As expected of a woman from Dongdu.

988
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,670
What beautiful handwriting!

989
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,340
Not only can she write,

990
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,670
but she can also play the qin.

991
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,790
How did Chu Bin died?

992
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,960
They said she died of illness.

993
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,410
That year, I was doing some small business,

994
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,670
traveling between Hanzhou and Shazhou.

995
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,190
I rarely returned to Yunding.

996
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,450
By the time I came back,

997
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,840
I learned that Chu Bin had already passed,

998
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,030
and Li Yun

999
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,000
was already discussing marriage with Shen Ping.

1000
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,990
In the past two years,

1001
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,650
I noticed myself getting old.

1002
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,630
I didn't want to travel around anymore,

1003
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,230
so I settled down in Yunding.

1004
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,620
I got hooked on cockfighting.

1005
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,870
Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose.

1006
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,990
I'm just in it for fun.

1007
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,850
I brought Li Yun along a few times,

1008
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,990
and he got hooked too.

1009
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,890
Cockfighting is sure fun.

1010
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,150
But he rarely won

1011
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,590
and lost often.

1012
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,110
Did you introduce

1013
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,680
the woman in the veil

1014
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,630
named Lin Bei to him?

1015
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,470
Yes.

1016
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,750
He kept telling me how much

1017
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,030
he missed Chu Bin.

1018
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,070
To relieve his lovesickness,

1019
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,630
I went to find Lin Bei.

1020
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,430
But this woman is truly extraordinary.

1021
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,310
If you clearly describe to her

1022
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,680
the appearance

1023
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,910
of the woman you miss,

1024
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,510
within a few days,

1025
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,830
she can transform into that woman,

1026
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,710
with exactly the same appearance

1027
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,910
and charm.

1028
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,190
I have been learning miscellaneous skills from my master since I was young.

1029
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,950
The so-called miscellaneous skills

1030
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,110
are the various techniques

1031
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,590
that women in the world are good at,

1032
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,920
all combined together.

1033
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,390
Of course,

1034
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,750
my master would also ask me to imitate passersby

1035
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,790
on the streets.

1036
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,350
Be it their gait,

1037
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,070
their voice,

1038
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,610
every single movement

1039
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,930
or facial expression,

1040
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,870
I've to learn to imitate them precisely.

1041
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,200
This woman has been in Yunding for a month.

1042
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,060
She's only done

1043
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,720
three to five business deals.

1044
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,650
It is said that her clients

1045
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,510
were all very satisfied with her.

1046
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,060
I put down a deposit ten days ago.

1047
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,020
Two days ago...

1048
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,350
Alike.

1049
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,070
So alike.

1050
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,310
Alike, yeah?

1051
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,830
During the first meeting,

1052
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,160
you can't get too close.

1053
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,670
This is her rule.

1054
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,710
She is exactly the Chu Bin I want.

1055
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,590
I want to hold her in my arms.

1056
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,390
Why can't I?

1057
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,600
Are you crazy?

1058
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,550
In broad daylight.

1059
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,280
where'd there be a female ghost?

1060
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,350
I want to meet her.

1061
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,570
Embrace her all night long.

1062
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,030
That's tough.

1063
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,530
It depends if she is

1064
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,670
willing or not.

1065
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:26,930
Step aside.

1066
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,290
I told Lin Bei

1067
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,920
about Li Yun's desire

1068
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,560
to meet her.

1069
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,900
He's really interesting.

1070
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,110
I'll meet him.

1071
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,030
As for when

1072
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,070
and where to meet,

1073
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,890
I will write to him myself.

1074
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,610
The letter was written by me.

1075
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,830
I personally delivered it

1076
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,560
to the entrance of Tianyi Fabric Shop.

1077
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,160
The owner of Tianyi Fabric Shop said

1078
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,150
she saw Li Yun

1079
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,880
put this letter in his chest pocket

1080
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,910
and then go out to Biluo Inn.

1081
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,590
But up until now,

1082
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,350
we haven't found this letter

1083
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,430
on Li Yun's body.

1084
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,750
Because

1085
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,230
it wasn't on him.

1086
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,270
Chu Bin.

1087
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,040
It's been ten years.

1088
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,360
We've been separated by death.

1089
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:40,810
How have you been?

1090
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,520
Where's the letter?

1091
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,590
I didn't think he deserved

1092
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,050
to see Chu Bin again at all.

1093
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,870
So I took the letter and left.

1094
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,630
Where is the letter then?

1095
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:00,500
There.

1096
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,760
In order to imitate Chu Bin's handwriting,

1097
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,420
I practiced for several days.

1098
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,700
If I didn't burn it to ashes,

1099
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,240
I'm afraid the ghost

1100
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,430
would really come to possess my body.

1101
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,490
Ms. Lin, could I ask you to write another letter?

1102
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,430
I'm sorry.

1103
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,750
For me,

1104
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,860
this business deal is already over.

1105
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,470
I can no longer write

1106
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,930
in Chu Bin's handwriting.

1107
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,530
Before the case is closed,

1108
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,050
you cannot leave Yunding.

1109
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,880
If you want to move inns,

1110
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,540
you need to inform the government office in advance.

1111
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,400
I'm not in a hurry to leave either.

1112
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,240
[Yunding County Government Office]

1113
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,630
Sheriff Lu, please go back.

1114
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,590
If there's anything,

1115
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,510
I, Fang, will be at your service anytime.

1116
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,480
Also,

1117
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:58,800
I wonder if I have the honor

1118
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,200
to invite you to my humble abode for a drink?

1119
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,000
Okay.

1120
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,190
Thank you.

1121
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,870
After cracking this case,

1122
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:05,870
let's find a time.

1123
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,170
It's settled then.

1124
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,290
I, Fang, shall take my leave.

1125
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,630
What this Fang Jiong said

1126
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:17,840
checks out with

1127
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,190
what Lin Bei said.

1128
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,310
It's more than that.

1129
