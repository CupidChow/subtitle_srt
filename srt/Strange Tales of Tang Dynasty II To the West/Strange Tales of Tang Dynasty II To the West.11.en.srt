There's no wound

on the victim's head,

7
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,509
and there are no signs of poisoning.

8
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,150
Got that.

There're scratches on his left arm and the back of his left hand.

There're bruises on his left upper arm.

Examining.

13
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,010
There're huge bruises

14
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,150
on the victim's right arm and right wrist.

15
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,190
There are scratches

16
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,120
on his right arm.

Examining.

18
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,950
The victim was stabbed in the back with a blade.

19
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,870
Got that.

20
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,430
There're wounds on his chest.

21
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,160
Both front and back.

22
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,829
The skin around the wounds is largely wrinkled and bulging.

23
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,280
The blood stains around are coagulated.

24
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,790
Got that.

25
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,140
There's also a tear

26
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,710
on the robe.

27
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,240
It's the same kind as the wound on the body,

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,000
and there are blood stains both inside and out.

29
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,030
So the preliminary determination is that

30
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,880
he was stabbed by a sharp weapon

31
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
in the back,

32
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,670
which pierced through his body

33
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,130
and stuck out of his chest.

34
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,270
This is the fatal wound.

35
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,990
Judged by the wound, the time of death should be

36
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,270
9 p.m. the day before yesterday.

37
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,440

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,270
Come on, there's enough for everyone.

195
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,550
You can all have it. Don't push.

196
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,350
Here you go.

197
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,870
Come on. Don't push.

198
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,950
Here you go.

199
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,510
Give me one. Give me one.

200
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,750
This naan is really delicious.

201
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,550
How much is it?

202
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,440
It's free.

203
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,710
Ma Huai

204
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,830
asked his staff to give away naans for free in the streets.

205
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,430
And he said

206
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,970
this would go on for 3 days.

207
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,950
Magistrate, try it.

208
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,130
Are his naans hard to sell?

209
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,120
They're not.

210
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,750
Since Ma Huai returned to Shiyang

211
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,910
and opened his naan shop,

212
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,640
his business

213
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,710
has been thriving.

214
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,870
The victim, Lou Qingtai,

215
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,030
once suspected his father Lou Lide

216
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,230
was poisoned to death

217
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,380
by this naan.

218
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,870
You don't think Ma Huai could have...

219
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,120
Lu Lingfeng.

220
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,150
I did these two rough sketches

221
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,870
according to

222
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,230
Lou Qingtai's sister's

223
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,130
statement.

224
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,070
Take a look

225
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,230
and see if it can help solve the case.

226
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,350
Ms. Pei.

227
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,140
Qingniao is a mute,

228
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,080
yet you managed to guess

229
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,380
what she wanted to say

230
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,750
and drew it.

231
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,480
You're a genius.

232
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,400
That's true.

233
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,260
Ms. Pei is indeed a genius.

234
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,480
Back when we were in Nanzhou...

235
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,210
Who's beating the Admonishment Drum?

236
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,610
Ma Huai, why are you beating the drum?

237
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,830
This drum is for

238
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,110
those who have grievances to report.

239
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,550
You...

240
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,230
I killed someone.

241
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,430
I killed Lou Qingtai.

242
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,290
I plead guilty.

243
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,990
That night,

244
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,590
I was going to deliver

245
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,590
clay to Dugu Yang.

246
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,910
Right after I moved all the clay

247
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,710
into the yard,

248
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,470
Lou Qingtai came.

249
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,310
You...

250
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,050
Why are you here?

251
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,270
Are you here to get even with Dugu Yang?

252
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,670
Yes.

253
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,710
He's not here.

254
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,550
You...

255
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,600
I'll get even with you instead.

256
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,310
I told you

257
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,020
your father did like

258
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,860
my naans,

259
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,750
but his death has nothing to do with me.

260
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,750
Nothing?

261
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,220
Then why did you bribe Dugu Yang,

262
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,750
even with silver ingots?

263
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,350
What are you doing now?

264
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,390
You're such a rich shop owner.

265
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,990
Why do you work for Dugu Yang?

266
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,010
It's obvious that you colluded with him,

267
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,210
and he helped you conceal your crime

268
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,620
of poisoning my father.

269
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,350
I didn't poison your father.

270
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,310
And I won't let you slander Coroner Dugu.

271
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,790
Go away!

272
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,280
Lou Qingtai.

273
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,000
You can't slander me,

274
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,190
and you can't slander Coroner Dugu.

275
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,760
After I got home,

276
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,200
the more I thought about it, the more scared I got.

277
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,470
I was worried that Lou Qingtai

278
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,530
would hold this against Coroner Dugu

279
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,120
and come back to avenge him when he got home.

280
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,750
So I went back.

281
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,890
I didn't expect

282
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,200
that Lou Qingtai was already dead.

283
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,210
I committed involuntary manslaughter.

284
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,410
I was filled with remorse,

285
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,530
but it was too late.

286
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,370
I was afraid of being discovered,

287
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,830
so I hid the body

288
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,470
in a clay figurine.

289
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,350
I was worried someone would see me,

290
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,890
so I left

291
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,710
with the clay figurine half-done.

292
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,240
I, Ma Huai, am the murderer.

293
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,010
There's nothing to deny here.

294
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,950
I'll accept it even if I have to pay with my life.

295
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,880
Unfortunately,

296
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,870
Lou Lide is dead.

297
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,390
I can't be beheaded

298
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,240
by the same executioner as my parents.

299
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,670
How dare you, Ma Huai!

300
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,830
Did you poison Lou Lide to death?

301
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,190
Of course not.

302
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,760
I only use fresh lamb

303
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,830
in my naans.

304
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,250
I use a variety of seasonings to make them taste delicious,

305
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,780
but they're not poisonous.

306
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,630
Then why did you

307
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,720
bribe Dugu Yang?

308
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,190
What do you mean I bribed him?

309
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,690
Look what this is.

310
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,320
Who drew this?

311
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,870
It does look like us.

312
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,960
So you admit it?

313
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:46,850
No, I don't.

314
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,510
You don't?

315
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,350
We have a witness.

316
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,780
Lou Lide's daughter Qingniao

317
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,110
saw it with her own eyes.

318
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,550
If you take advantage of her being a mute

319
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,510
and refuse to confess,

320
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,190
you'll be tortured.

321
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:57,870
I admit that

322
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,670
I did give Coroner Dugu some silver ingots,

323
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,070
but that wasn't bribery.

324
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,920
I won't allow you

325
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,850
to tarnish my mentor's innocence.

326
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,070
Mentor?

327
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Were you learning

328
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,750
how to make clay figurines that keep tomb robbers away

329
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,600
from him?

330
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,440
This has nothing to do with my killing.

331
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,300
I don't want to talk about it.

332
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,310
When you left the backyard

333
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,740
of the burial goods store for the first time,

334
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,540
did you see Lou Qingtai was dead?

335
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,270
No.

336
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,470
Did his eyes bulge?

337
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,250
And what about his tongue?

338
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,470
Well...

339
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,510
I can't remember.

340
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,270
What about his hands?

341
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,090
He seemed to be pinching his neck

342
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,110
with his hands in an attempt to breathe better.

343
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,550
Lu Da's younger brother.

344
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,110
Qingniao's older brother.

345
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,270
So Qingniao's older brother

346
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,400
that Mr. Su murmured

347
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,710
is Lou Qingtai.

348
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,869
Lu Da's younger brother

349
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,819
is Lu Er.

350
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,780
Although he's still unconscious,

351
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,390
he managed to name

352
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,670
the two bodies.

353
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,550
He's indeed a genius.

354
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,150
Unfortunately, he's still in a coma

355
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,310
and can't perform postmortem.

356
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,770
I don't think he can wake up

357
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,569
in a few days.

358
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,790
We should ask a coroner from a nearby county

359
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,030
to assist in the postmortem.

360
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,390
Why do we need another coroner?

361
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,050
Haven't all three bodies

362
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,380
already been examined?

363
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,790
Cao Hui is a competent coroner.

364
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,740
But due to her illness,

365
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,710
she didn't complete the postmortem.

366
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,310
Besides,

367
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,150
according to the current statement

368
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,750
and the postmortem results,

369
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,190
Lu Er was killed by Dugu Yang,

370
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,830
and Lou Qingtai was killed by Ma Huai.

371
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,510
But there's no clue

372
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,650
as to who killed Dugu Yang.

373
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,470
Regarding the murderer of Dugu Yang,

374
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,270
I have 3 suspects

375
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,630
in my mind.

376
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,840
Go ahead.

377
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,290
The first one is Chunshan.

378
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,050
He's the most suspicious.

379
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,550
Where is the seal?

380
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,190
There's no seal at all.

381
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,880
Take the 10 taels of silver here

382
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,340
and leave Shiyang County.

383
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,960
Never come back again.

384
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,950
Dugu Yang.

385
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,040
You own such a precious seal,

386
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,430
yet you made my sister live in poverty with you.

387
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,580
I haven't said anything in so many years.

388
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,480
Now you want me to cover up the fact that you committed murder

389
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,140
just with some silver ingots?

390
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,230
Do I look like a beggar to you?

391
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,510
Shameless!

392
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,300
You're even worse than a beggar.

393
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,750
Get lost!

394
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,470
Dugu Yang.

395
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,390
If you don't give me the seal,

396
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,880
I'll look for it myself.

397
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,150
But in the end,

398
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,190
Chunshan didn't find Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal

399
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,590
in the burial goods store.

400
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,910
After that, he escaped from Shiyang

401
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,190
and took part in treasure gambling in Qingchuan Town,

402
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,520
where he met General Lu.

403
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,790
Then, he sneaked back

404
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,540
to Dugu Yang's house

405
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,320
in an attempt to steal the seal.

406
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,450
Your analysis is reasonable.

407
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,190
But when did Chunshan admit he killed Dugu Yang?

408
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,450
Where is the evidence?

409
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,960
Well...

410
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,210
I don't have it now.

411
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,990
But I'm afraid

412
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,670
torture is the only way we can deal with such a shameless person.

413
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,270
Continue.

414
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,030
The second suspect

415
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,270
is Dong Haogu.

416
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,770
I didn't report it to the court

417
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,390
because I didn’t want to get myself suspected.

418
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,830
Since he didn't get the seal,

419
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,510
Dong Haogu

420
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,610
first seduced a married woman,

421
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,710
and then tried to take advantage of

422
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,910
that rat, Chunshan.

423
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,230
How can we believe his words?

424
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,150
I think

425
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,830
this is what happened

426
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,830
on that night.

427
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,110
This seal is an ancestral inheritance of my family.

428
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,840
Please take good care of it.

429
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,720
Don't do it wrong.

430
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,670
No problem.

431
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,070
Dugu Yang.

432
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,490
Do you really think

433
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,150
I'm doing business with you?

434
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,740
I love the seal,

435
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,030
but I love money more.

436
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,590
After Dong Haogu got the seal,

437
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,290
he didn't escape from Shiyang immediately.

438
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,180
On the one hand, he didn't want to give himself away.

439
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,750
On the other hand,

440
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,210
he wanted to get Chuntiao.

441
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,550
That makes sense.

442
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,950
Dong Haogu kept saying

443
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,550
everything he said was true.

444
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,310
But how can we be credulous facing such a profiteer?

445
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,640
Who else do you suspect?

446
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,830
Niu Daming.

447
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,780
The night watchman, Uncle Zhong,

448
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,970
saw it with his own eyes

449
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,630
that he escaped from the burial goods store before 1 a.m. in panic.

450
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,670
The reason why he looked flustered

451
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,750
was that he just killed

452
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,350
Dugu Yang.

453
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,230
Who is it?

454
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,160
Niu Daming.

455
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,120
Why are you here again?

456
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,860
My wife's business has nothing to do with you.

457
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,670
But if you die,

458
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,580
your wife will have everything to do with me.

459
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,630
The woman of my dream, Chuntiao,

460
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,790
will be mine.

461
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,200
To get Chuntiao,

462
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,690
Niu Daming has gone crazy.

463
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,430
Now I think

464
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,110
we should interrogate Niu Daming first.

465
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,430
He's even more suspicious than Chunshan.

466
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,990
Besides,

467
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,170
there's a witness.

468
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,910
What you said does make sense.

469
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,840
But Niu Daming refused to confess.

470
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,470
He has worked in the government office for many years.

471
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,530
He's very cunning.

472
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,490
If we want him to confess,

473
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,810
we'll have to torture him.

474
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,790
Dugu Xiashu.

475
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,510
Not long ago in Chang'an,

476
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,710
the Mara escaped the wall  and caused a bloodbath.

477
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,540
Time was tight, and there was no way to investigate.

478
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,270
Some suspects were arrested.

479
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,150
But Su Wuming and I

480
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,870
never tortured anyone

481
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,990
because we were worried that they'd confess to avoid being punished,

482
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,390
which may result in wrongful convictions.

483
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,670
I'm ashamed.

484
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,630
Thank you for reminding me, General Lu.

485
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,200
So now, we...

486
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,150
Lu Lingfeng.

487
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,490
I drew it according to Qingniao's statement.

488
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,230
Magistrate Dugu.

489
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,710
The judgement you made before

490
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,550
is unfair.

491
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,580
Why is that? Please enlighten me.

492
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,030
Considering the items Dong Haogu bought from the tomb,

493
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,870
his crime is tantamount to tomb robbery.

494
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,470
But he was only flogged 20 times

495
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,800
before he was released.

496
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,350
Although Niu Daming stabbed someone with a dagger in the street,

497
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,150
it was just an attempted murder.

498
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,350
Besides, he's been a government official for years.

499
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,350
He may have not achieved much, but he did work hard.

500
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,210
How could you put him on death row?

501
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,230
So what's your opinion, General Lu?

502
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,990
Release him.

503
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,840
After all, he's worked in the government office for a long time.

504
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,440
If you treat your subordinates nicely,

505
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,500
when others see it,

506
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,100
they'll also be willing to work for you.

507
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,170
I don't think we should do that.

508
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:54,990
Why not?

509
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,590
I've said everything I have to say.

510
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,960
Why do they want me to go to court again?

511
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,390
They don't want you in court.

512
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,190
They said you can go home now.

513
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:18,980
Zhou.

514
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,810
Are you kidding me?

515
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,650
Leave here or not, I don't care.

516
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,700
Why are you riding so fast?

517
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,050
How can you ride a horse like that?

518
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,750
Who did that?

519
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,590
I only want the treasure.

520
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,290
I don't want your life.

521
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,430
Just leave your package

522
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,910
and get lost.

523
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,830
Where did you come from, little bandit?

524
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,090
How dare you kidnap me?

525
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,350
Do you want to die?

526
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,020
Hero, let's be friends.

527
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,470
How about

528
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,310
we share the treasure half and half?

529
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,170
In your dreams.

530
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,690
There's a treasure called

531
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,150
Dugu's seal or something.

532
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,680
If you have that treasure,

533
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,850
I may consider sparing your life.

534
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,080
You mean Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal?

535
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,680
Yes.

536
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,070
I don't have that.

537
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,110
You're about to die, and you're still lying.

538
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,790
Looks like

539
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,020
I have no option but cut off your head.

540
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,950
Don't.

541
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,750
I really don't have it.

542
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,270
Hero.

543
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,940
Please spare my life.

544
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,770
You can have

545
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,480
all these.

546
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,640
I just want the seal.

547
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,880
That seal has got many people killed.

548
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,870
But until now,

549
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,190
no one has seen it.

550
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,030
I think

551
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,430
it's just a lie

552
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,190
made up by Dugu Yang

553
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,120
to fool his wife.

554
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,610
There is no such thing in the world at all.

555
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,600
Unfortunately,

556
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,050
I was also deceived even though I worked in the government office for years.

557
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,310
I almost got beheaded.

558
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,490
Fortunately,

559
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,870
the nerd magistrate is a fool.

560
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,730
He released me.

561
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,910
That's why I was running for my life.

562
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,140
Although I'm a nerd magistrate

563
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,240
and I couldn't get my head around it,

564
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,170
where did you get

565
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,340
so many gold and jewels?

566
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
You're just a government official.

567
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,340
Niu Daming.

568
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,830
Niu Daming.

569
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,920
Where is Dugu Xiashu?

570
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,670
Mr. Su, you....

571
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,870
You're awake.

572
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,790
Zhou.

573
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,000
Niu Daming is very cunning.

574
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,670
We can release him for now

575
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,030
and lure him to give himself away.

576
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,160
He's been released.

577
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,650
I just got the news.

578
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,610
Niu Daming tried to escape,

579
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,760
and Magistrate has taken some people to capture him.

580
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,030
Who's the one that came up with this idea?

581
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,690
General Lu.

582
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,390
I remember now.

583
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,060
Lu Lingfeng has arrived in Shiyang.

584
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,910
General Lu

585
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,790
also found two other bodies

586
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,870
in the clay figurines in the burial goods shop.

587
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,230
They were tomb robbers, Lu Er and...

588
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,330
Lou Qingtai?

589
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,120
How did you know?

590
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,230
Have the bodies been examined?

591
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,720
Yes.

592
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,110
Have the suspects been interrogated?

593
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,630
Yes.

594
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,430
Bring me the records.

595
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:43,870
Okay.

596
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,660
[Government Office of Shiyang County]

597
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,520
Magistrate.

598
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,300
General Lu!

599
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,690
Mr. Su is awake.

600
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,310
Great.

601
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,160
Did he say anything?

602
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:02,870
He said

603
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,510
you should release Niu Daming

604
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,310
to lure him to give himself away.

605
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,790
General Lu, look.

606
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,740
Mr. Su and you

607
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,940
had the same idea again.

608
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,110
He also asked for the files

609
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,310
and the postmortem records.

610
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,780
Now,

611
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,680
he's being carried

612
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,340
to the mortuary place in the government office.

613
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,090
Who's beating the Admonishment Drum this time?

614
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,400
Madam.

615
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,360
Stop beating it.

616
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,240
I'm here.

617
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,830
Why didn't you stay at home

618
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,760
and recuperate?

619
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,960
I've recovered.

620
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,260
I didn't expect that this old drunkard is a miracle-working physician.

621
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,590
He gave me a few injections,

622
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,270
and now

623
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,790
I'm full of energy.

624
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,210
As a coroner,

625
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,670
I can't give up the postmortem halfway.

626
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,230
Where are the bodies?

627
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,730
I want to continue.

628
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,030
Hurry up.

629
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,080
The female coroner said

630
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,590
the strangling injury

631
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,960
wasn't fatal.

632
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,770
Arrange for her to continue the postmortem.

633
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,780
I, Cao Hui, the female coroner of Tang, am here to examine the body.

634
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Ghosts and gods, please stay clear.

635
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,870
What are you doing?

636
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,710
I'm examining the body.

637
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,030
Are you a coroner?

638
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,270
No.

639
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,280
If you are not a coroner, how can you examine the body?

640
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:27,430
Madam.

641
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,230
He is...

642
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,510
Carry me out.

643
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,370
Don't disturb the coroner's work.

644
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,030
Look, he's awake.

645
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,710
Brother.

646
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,550
Brother.

647
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,110
Don’t cry.

648
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,450
Now that I've survived this,

649
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,110
I can live at least ten more years.

650
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,670
Chicken Fed.

651
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,620
Thank you for saving my life again.

652
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,230
You should thank Lu Lingfeng.

653
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,870
If it weren't for him,

654
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,470
the assassin would have

655
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,630
taken your head away.

656
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,830
In that case, there would be nothing

657
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,690
that I could do.

658
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,540
Please thank him on my behalf then, Sister.

659
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,200
It seems Lu Lingfeng

660
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,930
doesn't want to talk to me.

661
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,870
Brother.

662
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,190
He has some misunderstanding in you.

663
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,990
You must have

664
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,810
your reasons for doing this.

665
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,010
You should tell him.

666
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,630
What is there to say?

667
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,160
Forget it.

668
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,510
Fei.

669
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,670
Tell Magistrate Dugu that

670
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,060
after Cao Hui is done with the postmortem,

671
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,910
I want to do it again.

672
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,020
Xijun.

673
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,710
Go buy me something

674
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,430
from the street.

675
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,150
Okay.

676
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,640
Brother.

677
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,790
Yingtao is awake too.

678
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,930
How about I take you to see her?

679
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,120
Help me

680
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,750
buy that thing first.

681
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,640
Magistrate.

682
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,790
Although there're no obvious injuries on the victim's body,

683
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,910
it doesn't mean

684
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,220
there's no fatal internal injury.

685
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,800
Please put the body under the sun

686
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,830
in an hour.

687
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,800
I'm Cao Hui.

688
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,240
Postmortem goes on.

689
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,440
Brother.

690
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,570
I bought it.

691
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,950
Good.

692
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
Magistrate Dugu.

693
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,680
Since the coroner isn't back yet,

694
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,780
can I give it a try first?

695
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,990
How do you want to try, Mr. Su?

696
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,590
Get me some water

697
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,790
and pour it on the body.

698
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,990
Chicken Fed.

699
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,170
Do me a favor.

700
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,470
Use this red umbrella

701
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,070
to block the sun.

702
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,870
Observe every part carefully.

703
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,790
Okay.

704
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,510
Look.

705
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,680
Fei.

706
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,150
Move the umbrella.

707
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,150
Cover it.

708
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,630
The wounds aren't caused by

709
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,490
sharp weapons and blunt weapons.

710
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,670
The wounds are not obvious,

711
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,400
and they're not easy to be seen.

712
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,110
Judging from the faded wounds,

713
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,230
the ribs here

714
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,830
were broken under heavy pressure.

715
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,550
Impressive.

716
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,080
What if a long time passed,

717
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,740
the body has decomposed,

718
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,960
and there were only bones left?

719
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,310
What would you do?

720
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,230
I can use the Bone Steam Method.

721
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,090
Stop bluffing.

722
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,740
Your speech

723
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,530
isn't convincing at all.

724
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,790
Then we can only cut open his chest

725
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,630
and check his ribs directly.

726
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,990
You mean autopsy?

727
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,520
What if the victim's family doesn't allow it?

728
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,320
If the family doesn't allow it,

729
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,870
there's nothing I can do.

730
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,960
I, Cao Hui, the female coroner of Tang, am here to examine the body.

731
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,060
Irrelevant people, stay clear.

732
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,540
Light the fire.

733
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,060
Grill white plum cakes.

734
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,070
Chuntiao.

735
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,090
Learn from me.

736
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,190
What are you waiting for?

737
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,150
Mother.

738
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,320
I'm afraid of dead people.

739
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,600
How can a coroner's wife be not afraid of dead people?

740
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,070
Don't force her. I'll do it.

741
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,900
Get out of the way, old drunkard.

742
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,760
Three generations of our family have been coroners.

743
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,290
We've never made any mistake in postmortems.

744
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,350
Now,

745
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,620
we're in Shiyang Government Office

746
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,750
and under the witness of Magistrate

747
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,510
and everyone here.

748
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,560
Just consider this

749
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,989
as helping me

750
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,310
for my son.

751
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,030
Yes.

752
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,190
Magistrate.

753
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,730
The ribs are broken in these places,

754
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,590
which were caused by the pressure of heavy objects.

755
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,270
This person

756
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,230
was suffocated and pressured to death.

757
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,280
Using white plum cakes in postmortems.

758
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,470
I heard about it from my mentor, Detective Di, once.

759
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,370
I didn't expect

760
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,270
I could see it with my own eyes today.

761
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,950
Thank you, Madam.

762
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,120
This method is to show

763
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,410
internal injuries on the surface of the skin.

764
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,070
It's a sophisticated method.

765
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,090
I, Lu Lingfeng,

766
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,610
admire you a lot.

767
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,730
You flatter me.

768
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,810
Postmortem is over.

769
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,320
I, Cao Hui, will take my leave.

770
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,610
Hold on.

771
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,850
All the staff of Shiyang Government Office here

772
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,390
want to thank you, Madam.

773
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,930
-Thank you, Madam.
-Thank you, Madam.

774
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,870
Assistant Xu.

775
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,110
Double the postmortem fee for her.

776
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:20,780
Okay.

777
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,650
I don't want the money.

778
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,850
I just hope the new county magistrate

779
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,160
can solve the case as soon as possible

780
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,810
and catch the murderer who killed my son.

781
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,350
I, Cao Hui,

782
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,860
will wait for your good news.

783
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,150
Mother.

784
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:41,810
Mother.

785
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,570
Madam, wait.

786
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Magistrate Dugu.

787
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,110
The case is basically clear.

788
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,630
Why don't we bring the suspects to the court

789
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,310
and interrogate them in front of everyone?

790
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:05,690
[Justice and Integrity]

791
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,150
Here in court,

792
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,870
I'll ask you questions,

793
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,750
and you must think carefully before you answer.

794
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,280
Because everything you say

795
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,470
will be documented.

796
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:24,830
Ma Huai.

797
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,310
You make great naans.

798
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,830
Thank you.

799
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,150
You said Dugu Yang was your mentor.

800
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,170
Now his mother

801
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,490
and wife are both here.

802
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,590
Can you tell us

803
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,430
how you became his disciple?

804
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,850
I said

805
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,470
it has nothing to do with this case.

806
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,230
The murderer will be sentenced to death.

807
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,880
This may be

808
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,910
your last chance.

809
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,200
Why don't you

810
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,630
tell us about it?

811
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,270
I'm also a Juren.

812
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,270
But I never gave up my dream all these years.

813
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,990
I traveled far to the Western Region

814
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,080
and stayed in Xizhou for 10 years.

815
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,100
I made some money

816
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,800
by selling naans.

817
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,790
A year ago,

818
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,450
I returned to Shiyang,

819
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,990
but my parents

820
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,800
were executed subsequently.

821
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,070
Lou Lide.

822
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,310
I'll kill you sooner or later.

823
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,470
I did say that,

824
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,330
but I said it out of anger.

825
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,250
Not long after I left home,

826
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,340
my parents

827
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,390
became tomb robbers.

828
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,210
They didn't die unjustly.

829
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,370
I stayed in Shiyang and opened a naan shop.

830
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,740
Unlike ordinary naans,

831
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,370
the naans I sell

832
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,540
have fresh lamb stuffed in them.

833
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,800
I opened more branches.

834
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,260
I not only share dividends

835
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,550
with the shopkeepers,

836
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,150
but also all the other staff.

837
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,560
I just hope now that they've got proper jobs,

838
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,750
they won't think about becoming tomb robbers.

839
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,210
After I buried my parents,

840
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,760
I went to Lingdu Burial Goods Store.

841
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,290
I was surprised to find that

842
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,830
the clay figurines there

843
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,150
were magnificent.

844
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,110
I wanted to learn this skill.

845
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,180
I wanted to teach it to more people

846
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,470
after I learn it

847
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,430
and open a burial goods shop

848
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,430
in every county.

849
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,750
This is actually a unique business.

850
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,920
But Dugu Yang sold

851
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,750
his clay figurines at a very low price.

852
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,660
How many times do you have to multiply the price

853
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,720
if you want to make a fortune out of it?

854
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,090
Business is business.

855
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,510
Of course I'll raise the price.

856
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,840
But what I want to do more

857
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,530
is to eradicate

858
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,350
all the tomb robbery in the world.

859
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,270
But Dugu Yang

860
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,700
turned me down

861
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,230
because I'm tomb robbers' son.

862
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,750
I didn't care.

863
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,870
I went to his house to beg him many times.

864
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,440
I bought a load of clay

865
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,870
specially used for clay figurine making every month

866
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,750
and sent it to him

867
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,210
to show my determination.

868
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,040
Finally,

869
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,580
2 months ago,

870
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,870
he agreed.

871
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,120
So you really agree?

872
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,950
I've thought it through.

873
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,390
If I can use my craftsmanship

874
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,450
to make some money,

875
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,120
Chuntiao can live a better life.

876
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,000
That'll be worth it.

877
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,280
Master.

878
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,810
How much did you pay Dugu Yang?

879
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,270
We agreed

880
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,680
I'd pay him 9 silver ingots of 10 taels.

881
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,840
3 per month,

882
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,790
for 3 months.

883
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,000
I've paid 6 of them.

884
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,470
There are documents.

885
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,990
6 silver ingots?

886
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,490
Why haven't I seen any of them?

887
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,870
I asked

888
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,360
Master once.

889
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:52,570
Master.

890
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,650
Is your wife happy to receive the silver ingots?

891
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,800
I haven't given them to her yet.

892
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,630
The day you finish your apprenticeship

893
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,280
happens to be Chuntiao's birthday.

894
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,720
I'll give them to her all at once when the time comes.

895
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,260
I'm sure she'll be happy.

896
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,110
I heard

897
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,870
your wife goes out to have tea and drinks with people a lot.

898
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,330
Master.

899
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,990
I don't want to hear

900
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,760
those boring people's gossip.

901
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,990
Don't you spread it, either.

902
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,190
She's my wife, I...

903
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,270
I know what kind of person she is.

904
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,130
She won't do anything behind my back.

905
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,510
Chuntiao.

906
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,450
Why are you crying in court?

907
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,510
How inappropriate.

908
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,580
Yes.

909
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:37,830
Ma Huai.

910
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,870
Do others know

911
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,790
that you took Dugu Yang as your master?

912
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,450
He asked me to keep it a secret.

913
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,210
I didn't want to publicize it either.

914
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,070
In that case,

915
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,800
the silver ingots Qingniao saw that day,

916
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,330
which you gave to Dugu Yang,

917
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,630
were the fee for your apprenticeship.

918
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,070
Yes.

919
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,630
A few days ago,

920
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,510
I completed 2 months of apprenticeship.

921
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,910
Now that I think about it,

922
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,070
that day

923
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,630
was the day

924
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,760
when Master examined Lou Lide's body.

925
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,310
Lou Lide?

926
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,470
The executioner?

927
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,950
I examined his body.

928
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,430
There are no injuries on the skin

929
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,590
and no signs of poisoning.

930
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,750
He should have died of an acute disease.

931
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,220
He had no facial nerve paralysis

932
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,620
or limb paralysis.

933
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,270
So it wasn't a stroke.

934
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,310
He seems to be in pain.

935
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,070
It should be that his chest got pinched,

936
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,600
and he died of chest tightness and chest pain.

937
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,120
This disease

938
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,430
is also known as angina.

939
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,750
It often occurs when a person uses a lot of energy

940
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,060
after he overeats.

941
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,870
In this case, he ate

942
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,830
too many naans stuffed with lamb.

943
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,070
After that,

944
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,090
he started lifting stone padlocks in the yard

945
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,630
to exercise his arm strength.

946
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,070
That's right.

947
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,430
Son,

948
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,440
the result of your postmortem is correct.

949
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,830
It's good to have you to double check, Mother.

950
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,950
I've been a coroner all my life,

951
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,180
and I never made any mistake.

952
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,790
I didn't

953
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,550
do the techniques you taught me wrong

954
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,630
or let you down, Mother.

955
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,870
My son.

956
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:22,880
What's wrong?

957
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,590
You're so young.

958
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,150
Why did you say things like "all your life"?

959
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:27,980
Mother.

960
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,510
My greatest blessing

961
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,270
is to be your son.

962
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,580
You no longer regret becoming a coroner?

963
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,060
It's a low-paid and menial job.

964
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,350
But the job of a coroner

965
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,150
is a matter of the truth of death

966
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,790
and the justice in the world.

967
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,360
Someone has to do it.

968
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:05,830
Ma Huai.

969
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,000
In that case,

970
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,230
you are actually a nice person.

971
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,350
But you strangled Lou Qingtai to death.

972
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,840
It's a capital crime.
