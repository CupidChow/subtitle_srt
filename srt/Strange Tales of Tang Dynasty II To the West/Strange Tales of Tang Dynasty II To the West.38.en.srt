[Episode 38]

4
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,470
Judging from this,

5
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,570
Fan sold me out, didn't he?

6
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,920
Since you already know,

7
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,750
just tell us the truth.

8
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,480
That old scoundrel.

9
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,750
The reason why I married him back then

10
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,470
is that I hoped he would die soon,

11
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,030
so that my father would pity me

12
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,840
and give me a larger share of the family property.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,699
Unexpectedly,

14
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,510
not only is he still not dead,

15
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,770
but he even sold me out.

16
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,190
Tell us

17
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,190
how you killed Duobao.

18
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,140
Cao Duobao was Ye Lai's child,

19
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,630
and that Ye Lai

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,110
is a vicious woman.

21
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,750
Why should the two of them

22
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,829
have a share of our family property,

23
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,070
which my father worked so hard for?

24
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,030
I wouldn't accept it!

25
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,090
Cao Rong said she wouldn't accept it,

26
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,790
and of course, I also wanted a larger share of the family property.

27
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,450
Therefore,

28
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,710
we stayed at Cao's Mansion yesterday.

29
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,890
Why does he keep going to the kitchen?

30
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,310
If he doesn't go to sleep,

31
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,240
it'll be hard for us to take action.

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,350
Rong.

33
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,710
Have you thought it through?

34
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,440
Cut the crap.

35
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,260
I was so anxious.

36
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,350
He went back and forth to the kitchen

37
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,550
3 or 4 times

38
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,510
before he

39
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,520
finally turned out the light.

40
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,670
After I saw Duobao turn out the light,

41
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,530
I thought he must have gone to bed,

42
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,280
so I asked that old scoundrel to hurry up and take action.

43
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,790
Yang?

44
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,430
You...

45
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:11,970
Hurry up!

46
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,800
What are you dawdling for?

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,060
Do you want people to find out about this?

48
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,260
I always thought

49
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,750
Duobao was quite strong physically.

50
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,430
However,

51
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,590
he didn't resist

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,860
with much strength.

53
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,710
I'm an old man.

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,230
At that time,

55
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,080
I was worried that I wouldn't be able to strangle him to death in a while.

56
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,330
But unexpectedly,

57
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,990
it was quite easy.

58
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,680
What is this for?

59
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,040
With his face covered,

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,240
his ghost won't be able to track us down.

61
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,480
Shameless.

62
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,950
So shameless!

63
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,030
I...

64
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,710
It was just a wrong decision made in a moment of weakness.

65
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,310
Nonsense!

66
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,440
If it was just a wrong decision made in a moment of weakness,

67
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,430
you wouldn't have prepared

68
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,890
the ying cloth in advance.

69
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,550
You old bastard.

70
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,720
I'll strangle you to death!

71
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,330
I'll kick him to death!

72
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,470
You conspired with your husband

73
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,720
to kill your younger brother of maiden home.

74
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,510
Have you ever regretted it?

75
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,909
I regret that I got caught by you.

76
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,850
Otherwise,

77
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,500
I could have gotten an even larger share of the family property.

78
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,360
I wish I could

79
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,920
slit your throat right now!

I, Pei Xijun,

82
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,820
never cursed anyone.

83
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,190
But you

84
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,860
will end up in hell!

Your reputation is well-deserved.

90

I can't cheer myself up.

104
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,110

How have I treated the people of Shazhou?

112
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:40,950
Well.

113
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,670
Very well.

114
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,830
It's good that you acknowledge it.

115

I must kill him with my own hands.

The ones who killed Duobao

118
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,790
are Fan Songling and his wife, who conspired with him.

119
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,920
That's impossible.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,550
Rong is just a little fool.

121
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,150
She hasn't had much education,

122
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,300
and she refused to learn needlework,

123
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,900
let alone business affairs.

124
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,950
She must have been

125
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,290
bewitched by that old scoundrel.

126

There are witness testimonies.

I'm afraid Cao Rong

129
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,670
is the mastermind.

130
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,650
That's even more impossible.

131
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,160
A child of mine, Cao Zhongda,

132
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,480
could never be a murderer.

133
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,870
It must be that Fan Songling.

134
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,910
He killed Duobao,

135
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,590
and now

136
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,990
he wants to frame my daughter.

137
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,790
You...

138
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,710

Mr. Cao.

140
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,429
Do you also think Duobao

141
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,360
was strangled to death too easily?

142
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,750
Yes.

143
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,750
I read the file

144
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,450
of Fan Songling's statement.

145
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,670
He said at the beginning,

146
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,990
Duobao was still trying to pry his hands off

147
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,990
so that he couldn't choke him,

148
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,190
but later, he stopped struggling.

149
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,990
Instead,

150
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,670
he covered his stomach with both hands.

151
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,590
Right.

152
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,360
I also found it very weird at that time.

153
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,230
From the two postmortems,

154
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,230
no signs of poisoning was detected.

155
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,150
Therefore,

156
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,910
I want to do another postmortem.

Third Young Lady

161
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,070
carried Young Master Duobao's body away.

162
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,030
I said the government office wouldn't allow it,

163
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,160
but Third Young Lady

164
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,450
slapped me in the face.

[Cao's Mansion]

166
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,510
Is Third Young Lady here?

167
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,310
What are you doing here?

168
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,310
Third Young Lady.

169
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,950
This case has not been completely solved yet.

170
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,030
I'm afraid we have to take Young Master Duobao's body

171
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,430
back to Qiande Hall

172
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,270
for postmortem.

173
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,590
Haven't you already caught the murderers?

174
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,830
What's the point of another postmortem?

175
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm afraid we can't tell you

176
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,830
the reason, Third Young Lady.

177
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,480
The body must be taken away.

178
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,270
Duobao has already been placed in the coffin.

179
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,390
I won't let anyone disturb him.

180
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,350
What if I say we must do another postmortem?

181
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,750
If you want to open the coffin,

182
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,950
you'll have to examine my corpse first.

183
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,940
Third Young Lady.

184
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,910
Throw them out!

Yes!

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,800
It's all thanks to Physician Fed's acupuncture.

192
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,790
What's going on here?

193
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,480
Duobao has already been placed in the coffin.

194
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,280
I won't let anyone take him away.

195
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,910
Since the murderers have already been caught,

196
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,710
why can't you leave my son alone?

197
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,830
Can't you just let him rest in peace?

198
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,190
Where is Zhongda?

199
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,070
How are you, Zhongda?

200
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,620
Today is your 60th birthday.

201
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,950
We are here to congratulate you.

202
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,150
The three elders

203
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,730
are from the Family Supervisory Committee.

204
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,350
Please speak frankly if you have anything to say.

205
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,110
You are here to urge me to set off to the underworld, aren't you?

206
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,300
It's stated in the Supervisory Committee's rules that

207
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,550
before you pass away,

208
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,470
we must pay you a visit.

209
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,910
I'll definitely set off to the underworld

210
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,230
before midnight.

211
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,760
Although today is my birthday,

212
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,940
there's no banquet here.

213
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,480
Please take your leave.

214
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,510
Zhongda, you're the most accomplished person

215
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,230
in the Cao family in Shazhou.

216
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,830
We three sincerely admire you.

217
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,390
Today,

218
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,850
we are also seeing you off sincerely.

219
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:19,950
Thank you.

220
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,430
Hanging something red at the gate

221
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,150
signifies the joy of longevity.

222
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,510
Hanging mourning banners in the courtyard

223
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,140
shows the filial piety of the children.

224
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,790
Zhongda.

225
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,110
Your one son and three daughters are all outstanding.

226
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,840
In this life,

227
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,470
you should have no regrets, right?

228
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,600
No regrets, indeed.

229
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,610
See the guests out.

230
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,120
Three elders.

231
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,460
The mourning banners hung in the courtyard

232
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,660
are not for my father.

233
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,590
They're for my younger brother, Duobaoi.

234
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,120
He was murdered last night.

235
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,230
Young Master Duobao?

236
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,800
He's dead?

237
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,360
Zhongda.

238
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,040
What on earth happened?

239
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,870
Duobao is already dead.

240
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,590
My father saw his child die earlier than himself.

241
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,070
No sadness in the mortal world

242
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,270
is greater than this.

243
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,030
Cao Xiao.

244
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,750
You can't joke about this kind of thing.

245
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,190
I saw Duobao

246
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,710
under the Mogao Caves yesterday.

247
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,990
He was still alive and kicking.

248
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,920
Of course I wouldn't joke about it.

249
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,630
Duobao was murdered.

250
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,060
The government

251
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,080
has already caught the murderers.

252
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,060
This is the official in charge of criminal hunting

253
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,840
appointed by Prefectural Governor,

254
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,500
Sheriff Lu.

255
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,810
He can testify.

256
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,770
We want to see the body.

257
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,110
The coffin has been sealed.

258
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,780
You can't see it.

259
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,540
How dare you!

260
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,310
We are not only elders,

261
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,990
but also the supervisors of the Cao family.

262
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,270
We must see

263
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,710
Duobao's corpse.

264
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,140
As they say, life is as unpredictable as the weather.

265
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,840
It's really heartbreaking

266
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,990
that Duobao died at such a young age.

267
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,970
We want to extend our condolences

268
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,970
to you, Zhongda, and your family.

269
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,950
However,

270
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,030
you,

271
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,660
Cao Zhongda,

272
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,610
get to live.

273
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,120
What do you mean by that?

274
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,780
Zhongda, there's something you don't know.

275
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,460
The Supervisory Committee has issued a new rule.

276
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,340
If the heir passes away,

277
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,550
the elderly person who's having the 60th birthday funeral

278
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,750
no longer needs to go.

279
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,310
Cao Duobao was your only son.

280
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,910
Now that he has passed away,

281
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,910
it fits perfectly with the new rule.

282
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,120
When did this new rule come into being?

283
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,960
Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival,

284
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,280
and the Family Supervisory Committee

285
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,680
decided this after careful deliberation.

286
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,020
Zhongda.

287
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,070
You are the first in the Cao family

288
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,780
to practice the new rule.

289
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,150
You've really hit the jackpot.

290
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,030
Father.

291
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,400
You don't have to go.

292
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,480
Yes, Father.

293
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,660
I'm happy for you.

294
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,660
Saisai.

295
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,480
Come on. Kowtow to Grandfather

296
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,330
and wish Grandfather longevity.

297
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,310
Get up. Get up.

298
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,550
We also wish Zhongda

299
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,880
longevity

300
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,470
and happiness in your old age.

301
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,910
My only son is dead.

302
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,260
This family is already shattered.

303
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,710
Tell me. Even if I live forever,

304
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,670
what joy is there to have,

305
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,170
and what happiness is there to enjoy?

306
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:46,630
Father.

307
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,340
Please don't be too sad.

308
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,130
Sis.

309
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,280
Get Father away.

310
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,790
The coffin lid needs to be closed now.

311
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,190
Let Duobao rest in peace.

312
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,790
Hold on.

313
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,990
What trouble are you trying to cause this time?

314
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,770
Please leave my house immediately.

315
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,670
Throw him out.

316
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,430
Yes!

317
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,940
Xiao.

318
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,260
Father, go have a rest.

319
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,470
I will handle Duobao's funeral.

320
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,670
Please rest assured.

321
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,660
You misunderstood, Third Young Lady.

322
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,470
Sheriff Lu

323
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,150
is not trying to cause trouble.

324
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,550
He's doing this for the good of your younger brother, Duobao.

325
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,020
Third Young Lady, you're in charge of the family's pawnshop business,

326
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,990
so you must be very knowledgeable, experienced,

327
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,430
and exceptionally wise.

328
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,170
But you are still too young.

329
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,310
You don't understand

330
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,470
the rules of funerals.

331
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,750
Once the coffin lid is closed,

332
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,660
it cannot be easily opened

333
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,790
until the burial.

334
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,830
If a coffin lid which has been sealed

335
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,430
is opened by any chance,

336
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,700
it absolutely cannot

337
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,430
be casually closed back again.

338
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,750
Even poor families

339
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,200
must follow this rule.

340
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,190
You Cao family is the richest  family in Shazhou.

341
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,430
Hurry up and

342
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,110
get a new coffin.

343
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,420
What kind of rule is that?

344
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,070
You don't understand,

345
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,430
and I don't have to explain it to you.

346
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,630
Mrs. Cao.

347
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,839
To comfort Young Master Duobao's soul,

348
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,790
which has already been disturbed,

349
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,190
please prepare another coffin

350
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,060
which is even better in quality.

351
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,310
Mr. Su, you're right.

352
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,960
My son has already been disturbed.

353
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,210
This coffin cannot be used anymore.

354
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,430
We must replace it with a new one.

355
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,520
You want to do another postmortem?

356
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,390
Exactly.

357
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,680
If you ask me,

358
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,590
since the murderers have been found

359
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,390
and they've confessed without reservation,

360
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,150
there's no need to do another postmortem, right?

361
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,950
We suspect there's more to Cao Duobao's death

362
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,010
than meets the eye.

363
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,020
Or rather,

364
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,850
there might be another murderer.

365
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,340
How is that possible?

366
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,550
There's no way

367
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,610
a kid was killed twice, right?

368
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,110
Of course it's possible.

369
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,030
Among the mysterious cases investigated by my mentor Detective Di,

370
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,270
there are precedents.

371
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,070
This happened in the Cao family.

372
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,070
Besides, Mr. Cao

373
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,050
is having his 60th birthday funeral today.

374
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,210
Prefectural Governor Zhang, there's something you don't know.

375
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,940
Mr. Cao's 60th birthday funeral

376
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,300
has been cancelled due to Duobao's death.

377
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,600
Therefore, another postmortem

378
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,090
is absolutely necessary.

379
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,430
Wait a minute.

380
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,350
The 60th birthday funeral of the Cao family

381
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,190
has been a tradition for hundreds of years.

382
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,320
After I took office,

383
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,050
I once proposed to abolish it.

384
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,930
But those from

385
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,270
their Family Supervisory Council

386
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,720
refused resolutely, and they even threatened to die for it.

387
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,980
How could it be abolished all of a sudden?

388
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,310
Besides,

389
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,830
it happened at this critical moment.

390
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,430
I couldn't help

391
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,110
but get suspicious.

392
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,190
I think we should just forget it.

393
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,900
The murderers have been found,

394
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,350
so the case can already be considered solved.

395
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,790
The delegation of Kang will arrive any day now.

396
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,190
Sheriff Lu still has important duties to fulfill.

397
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,920
Zhang Huang!

398
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,920
As a prefectural governor,

399
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,030
when it comes to the matter of life and death,

400
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,830
how can you allow any ambiguity?

401
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,710
As you know,

402
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,630
once the delegation of Kang arrives,

403
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,630
I will have to go to the capital city.

404
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,750
Aren't you afraid that I will report to His Majesty

405
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,210
and accuse you of disregarding human lives?

406
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,700
Sheriff Lu.

407
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,950
The top priority now

408
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,070
is to go to Cao's Mansion immediately

409
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,070
and bring back Cao Duobao's corpse.

410
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,790
I am not an official of this prefecture,

411
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,350
so it's inconvenient for me in many ways.

412
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,150
I'll leave it to you, Prefectural Governor Zhang.

413
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,230
Alright then.

414
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,830
I'll take care of it personally.

415
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,750
Master.

416
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,030
Mr. Su wants to examine the body.

417
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,830
Why did you bring us

418
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,590
here?

419
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,750
Postmortem is an important way

420
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,830
to solve mysterious cases,

421
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,890
but it's definitely not the only way.

422
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,830
Since the murder took place,

423
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,830
this row of portraits of the providers

424
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,070
has been coming to my mind

425
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,270
constantly.

426
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,160
The first in the row

427
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,240
must be Mr. Cao, Cao Zhongda.

428
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,970
The following ones are

429
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,360
Ye Lai, Cao Duobao, Cao Yin,

430
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,190
Li Chi, Cao Rong, Fan Songling,

431
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,550
Cao Xiao, and Saisai.

432
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,420
The last one...

433
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,550
It's that butler!

434
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,590
That's right.

435
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,350
It's the butler, Ding Mao.

436
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,410
Li Chi once said...

437
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,230
Your butler

438
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,030
wasn't loyal to you,

439
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,880
yet you let him

440
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
be a provider of the Cao Family Cave.

441
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,670
So I used 5 silver ingots.

442
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,860
I remember Mr. Su said that...

443
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,150
The providers are

444
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,730
the masters of this family.

445
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,030
Children

446
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,080
are even like the servants

447
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,230
who are very important to this family.

448
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,990
Good memory.

449
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,300
But from what I've observed of the Cao family,

450
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,430
it's Third Young Lady, Cao Xiao, who always makes the call.

451
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,830
Ding Mao was imprisoned,

452
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,810
yet the Cao family has still been well-organized.

453
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,510
It seems their family

454
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,840
wasn't affected at all.

455
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,510
So,

456
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,000
how important

457
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,640
could Ding Mao possibly be?

458
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,530
We need to get the answer from Mr. Cao.

459
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,830
But he's overcome with grief at the moment.

460
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,230
How should we bring it up?

461
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,810
Or we can ask Chief Architect Fan.

462
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,390
Let's go back and interrogate Fan Songling.

463
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,920
Let's go.

464
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,380
I've brought the body back.

465
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,350
Examine the body as fast as you can,

466
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,470
and send it back immediately after you finish.

467
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,100
The new coffin ordered by the Cao family

468
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,190
will arrive soon.

469
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,030
Hold on, Prefectural Governor.

470
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,350
I need you to witness this.

471
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,470
Forget it.

472
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,340
If you can't

473
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,570
find anything wrong,

474
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,440
it'll be embarrassing for you,

475
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,270
disciple of Detective Di.

476
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,000
I, Su Wuming,

477
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,870
don't care about my dignity.

478
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,860
The truth of the mysterious case is the most important.

479
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,830
Given Mr. Cao's

480
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,670
special status in Shazhou,

481
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,750
I have to request you to witness it in person, Prefectural Governor.

482
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,140
Alright then.

483
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,110
The rice balls are ready.

484
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,240
They're still warm.

485
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,480
This is the cotton cloth boiled in vinegar.

486
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,630
Prefectural Governor,

487
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,690
please have a seat.

488
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,030
No need.

489
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,330
Just do it fast.

490
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,000
I suggest you have a seat.

491
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,190
It will take about 2 hours.

492
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,400
But...

493
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,710
Right.

494
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,910
Since it's called the Cao Family Cave,

495
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,990
the providers

496
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,790
should naturally be from the Cao family.

497
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:36,950
I'm both

498
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,430
a son-in-law of the Cao family

499
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,210
and a chief architect,

500
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,720
so of course, I'm one of the providers.

501
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,590
But I never expected

502
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,850
Ding Mao would also be a provider.

503
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,720
I remember

504
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,600
it was because of Ye Lai.

505
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,610
This is truly magnificent and grand.

506
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,700
I wish there could be 10 providers,

507
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,790
so that it would be perfect in every way.

508
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,240
You mean you want Xiao to get married soon?

509
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,790
Didn't the matchmaker

510
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,830
visit us already?

511
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,710
Talk to her

512
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,680
and ask her to hurry up and make a decision.

513
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,020
Xiao is opinionated.

514
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,470
I dare not talk to her about this.

515
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,990
Then don't rush it.

516
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,540
After she finds her Mr. Right,

517
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,370
we'll add him to the mural.

518
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,200
There is someone else, though.

519
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,460
The butler, Ding Mao.

520
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,280
He believes in Buddhism

521
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,340
and is very devout.

522
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,070
He mentioned to me yesterday

523
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,950
that if he could become

524
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,320
a provider of this cave,

525
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,060
he would be willing to donate some money.

526
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,990
Ding Mao?

527
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,680
He even vowed

528
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,910
that if his wish could be granted,

529
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,070
he would be willing to stay in the Cao family for the rest of his life,

530
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,200
take care of Duobao,

531
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,830
and persuade Duobao to focus on learning the business

532
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,990
so that he can take over the Cao family's business in the future.

533
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,990
On that day, Ye Lai

534
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,460
said a lot of good things about Ding Mao.

535
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,230
If it were me,

536
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,050
I would have been suspicious.

537
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,590
But my father-in-law

538
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,650
had no guard against Ye Lai at all.

539
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,750
He actually agreed to her request right away.

540
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,230
I was so angry.

541
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,570
Why were you angry?

542
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,040
Don't you know who I, Fan Songling, am?

543
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,430
They actually wanted to paint a servant and me

544
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,470
in one painting.

545
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,630
How could I not be angry?

546
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,810
I couldn't let them get what they want so easily.

547
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,510
Who is this you're painting?

548
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,430
Ding Mao.

549
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,470
That butler.

550
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,360
They want Ding Mao to be a provider?

551
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,650
How come I didn't know about this before?

552
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,270
This was Ye Lai's idea.

553
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm afraid

554
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,630
we don't know exactly

555
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,420
what her relationship with Ding Mao is.

556
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,190
Shut up.

557
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,710
Don't talk nonsense.

558
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,360
I do love talking nonsense,

559
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,990
but everything happens for a reason.

560
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,710
As the matriarch of the family,

561
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,110
she put in a lot of effort

562
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,000
and said a lot of nice things

563
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,790
to help a servant become a provider.

564
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,270
If you say there's nothing going on

565
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,470
behind this,

566
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,430
I don't buy it.

567
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,830
So you think Ye Lai and Ding Mao

568
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,160
have an unusual relationship?

569
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,230
Do you have any evidence?

570
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,310
Evidence?

571
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,710
No.

572
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,970
It's not rare for servants

573
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,150
to be providers.

574
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,170
You made a wild guess just based on speculation.

575
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,750
What good does it do you?

576
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,660
I don't really care

577
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,590
whether it does anything good to me.

578
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,350
As long as it does no good to him,

579
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,870
I'll do it.

580
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,290
You old scoundrel.

581
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,010
You really deserve to die!

582
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,150
Old scoundrel?

583
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,630
Yeah.

584
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,270
I'm about to die anyway.

585
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,430
Everything I'm saying

586
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,990
is true.

587
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,070
Although this Fan Songling is detestable,

588
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,350
it's understandable

589
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,910
that he made such a guess.

590
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,700
It's just that

591
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,870
we have just arrived in Shazhou.

592
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,750
We are still unfamiliar with this place and the people here.

593
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,110
It'll be very difficult

594
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,470
for us to investigate the truth.

595
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,000
Why bother investigating?

596
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,690
Why don't we just gyp Ding Mao?

597
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,120
Time is running out,

598
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,450
so we can resort to unusual means.

599
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,630
I... I only took 5 silver ingots.

600
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,270
You won't give me the extreme punishment, will you?

601
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,470
You think this is about the 5 silver ingots?

602
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,590
I didn't know you were so vicious, Ding Mao.

603
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,520
How could you...

604
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,670
You actually did something so evil.

605
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,270
Do you think you can still call yourself human?

606
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,100
Why can't I call myself human?

607
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,350
What I've always wanted to be

608
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,230
is a good man.

609
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,230
Now,

610
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,590
Bao is dead.

611
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,110
You must avenge him!

612
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,150
Duobao was our friend.

613
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,240
Of course we want to avenge him.

614
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,390
But to find the murderer,

615
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,770
you must tell the truth.

616
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,670
Actually,

617
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,210
we already knew

618
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,030
what you've been trying to hide.

619
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,110
It's just that

620
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,590
we want to hear it from you in person.

621
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:08,990
I...

622
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,400
It turned black.

623
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,550
So before he was strangled to death,

624
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,210
he had already been poisoned.

625
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,050
This is also black.

626
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,520
He was indeed poisoned.

627
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,530
This method of poison detection

628
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,950
has existed since ancient times.

629
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,430
It's the valuable experience of generations of coroners throughout the ages.

630
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,530
More than one person

631
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,730
wanted Duobao dead.

632
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,990
What a good kid.

633
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,310
I'm so mad.

634
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,110
Fed.

635
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,670
Take a quick look.

636
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,290
What kind of poison is this?

637
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,470
It's not arsenic.

638
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,790
Judging from its smell,

639
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,130
it's a bit like aconite.

640
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,700
Aconite?

641
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,000
I think I've heard of it before.

642
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,720
It's a medicinal ingredient.

643
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,300
It is indeed a medicinal ingredient.

644
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,350
It has the effect of relieving rheumatism, chills and pains.

645
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,990
But in case of overdose,

646
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,130
it can also be life-threatening.

647
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,680
What you're talking about is common aconite.

648
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,090
There are many varieties of aconite.

649
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,390
Among them, there's one called Kusnezoff Monkshood Mother Root.

650
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,470
It's highly toxic.

651
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,910
But the poison in this

652
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,670
is not Kusnezoff Monkshood either.

653
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,510
Could it be Red Neck?

654
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,310
What is Red Neck?

655
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,910
The most toxic type of aconite

656
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,530
is called red aconite,

657
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,680
commonly known as Red Neck.

658
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,260
After being poisoned,

659
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,230
the person will feel a sting and tingling in the mouth and tongue.

660
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,390
Later, he'll experience numbness inside the mouth,

661
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:19,910
and then

662
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,940
that person will constantly want to drink cold water.

663
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,310
Drink cold water?

664
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,960
I remember Fan Songling said

665
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,660
before they took action,

666
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,870
they saw Duobao

667
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,730
go to the kitchen many times.

668
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,190
Xue Huan and I

669
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,670
checked the kitchen at Cao's residence.

670
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,270
There's a very big water urn.

671
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,240
The water inside

672
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,130
is very cold.

673
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,660
This adds up, doesn't it?

674
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,790
It seems this case

675
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,240
really has some hidden mystery behind it.

676
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,630
Prefectural Governor Zhang,

677
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,160
you're really insightful.

678
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,670
You guided us to take a different approach

679
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,270
and uncovered important clues.

680
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,550
This is truly a great achievement.

681
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,440
If it weren't for you,

682
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,790
who personally handled this,

683
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,190
how could we have made such a breakthrough?

684
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,070
Please, Prefectural Governor, give the order immediately

685
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,510
to seal up Cao's residence

686
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,110
and get Mr. Cao and his family

687
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,950
transferred to Qiande Hall.

688
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,150
Arrange them each in a different room

689
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,950
and assign people to keep them watch day and night.

690
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,750
Su Wuming.

691
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,750
Are you suspecting Mr. Cao?

692
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:19,940
Yes.

693
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,630
Mr. Cao is a man of great virtue.

694
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,990
How can you suspect him?

695
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,260
But with Duobao dead,

696
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,490
Mr. Cao wouldn't have to go through his 60th birthday funeral.

697
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,790
That's right.

698
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,630
A murderer always has a motive

699
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,790
for killing.

700
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,560
Family property may not be a big deal,

701
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,790
but survival is.

702
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,420
It seems that the one who'd benefit from Duobao's death the most

703
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,980
is indeed Mr. Cao.

704
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,110
Prefectural Governor.

705
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,580
Please give the order right away

706
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,690
to prevent

707
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,070
collusion.

708
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,910
Mr. Cao.

709
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,930
Prefectural Governor Zhang.

710
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,270
Are you here to arrest me in person?

711
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,010
No, no, no.

712
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,550
Regarding Young Master Duobao's death,

713
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,810
we still need to investigate some clues.

714
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,110
So I'm here to ask you, Mr. Cao,

715
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,770
to come with me to Qiande Hall.

716
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,390
Wasn't my son strangled to death

717
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,350
by Fan Songling?

718
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,870
Well,

719
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,550
there are some things

720
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,630
that I cannot say.

721
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,760
Please, Mr. Cao,

722
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,390
no more questions.

723
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,470
Twelve years ago,

724
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,610
when Mrs. Cao passed away,

725
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,060
Ye Lai, who was already

726
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,500
engaged to Ding Mao,

727
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,200
fainted at the door of Qiande Hall.

728
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,270
What... what happened?

729
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,230
What's going on?

730
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,100
Is she alright?

731
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,830
Quick, get the doctor!

732
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,310
Yes.

733
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,440
Ye Lai claimed

734
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,980
that she came from Hanzhou

735
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,639
to seek refuge with her uncle.

736
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,070
But her uncle passed away,

737
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,389
and she had no other relatives or friends in Shazhou.

738
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,850
Due to physical weakness,

739
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,610
she stayed at Qiande Hall for several days.

740
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,070
She and Mr. Cao developed feelings for each other over that time.

741
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,580
This is how she became the current

742
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,670
matriarch of the Cao family.

743
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,400
But this was all premeditated.

744
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,949
The mastermind behind this was Ding Mao.

745
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,790
He was a servant of the Cao family.

746
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,310
Since he knew well that the Cao family

747
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,190
had the tradition of 60th birthday funeral,

748
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,949
he and Ye Lai devised this scheme

749
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,080
with the intention of making their son

750
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,790
the heir of the Cao family.

751
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,110
Son?

752
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:39,790
That is to say,

753
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,389
Cao Duobao was...

754
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,830
When Ye Lai married into the Cao family,

755
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,949
she was already pregnant.

756
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,760
Over the years,

757
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,489
she has been deceiving Mr. Cao.

758
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,500
Let's interrogate the matriarch of the Cao family.

759
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,310
As soon as she saw Ding Mao's confession statement,

760
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,630
Ye Lai also confessed that

761
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,159
she conspired with Ding Mao

762
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,230
to wrest Mr. Cao's family property.

763
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,290
This scheme was devised 12 years ago.

764
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,910
After Ye Lai became the matriarch of the Cao family,

765
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,710
Ding Mao also became the butler.

766
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,950
The two of them occasionally had secret liaisons,

767
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,480
but they were very careful.

768
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,430
For 12 years,

769
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,560
he used his wife and child

770
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,560
to wrest someone else's family property.

771
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,790
He really carried out this scheme after long deliberation.

772
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,590
This Ding Mao

773
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,090
is really despicable.

774
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:27,990
Su Wuming.

775
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,590
What do you think?

776
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,590
You found out about

777
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,990
such a secret relationship in just one day.

778
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,030
You three are indeed top detectives.

779
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,480
Why are you being sarcastic?

780
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,520
What do you mean?

781
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,840
Mr. Cao

782
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,950
is a leader of Shazhou's business community.

783
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,470
He must not be an ordinary person.

784
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,000
They've been living under the same roof for 12 years.

785
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,070
If Ye Lai and Ding Mao

786
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,830
really had an affair,

787
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,340
no matter how careful they were,

788
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,070
could they really hide it from Mr. Cao?

789
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,070
Besides, the Cao Family Supervisory Committee

790
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,380
suddenly changed the rules

791
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,080
on Dragon Boat Festival.

792
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,350
And the next day

793
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,680
happened to be Mr. Cao's 60th birthday.

794
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,790
Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

795
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,350
Prefectural Governor.

796
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,610
We came a long way here,

797
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,230
and we are not familiar with Shazhou.

798
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,750
Perfectural Governor Zhang, please help interrogate

799
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,450
the patriarch of the Cao family

800
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,580
and members of the Family Supervisory Committee

801
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,380
on our behalf.

802
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,730
No problem.

803
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:44,810
[Cao's Mansion]

804
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,430
[Wealthy and Successful]

805
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,390
Time is running out.

806
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,630
Let's split up and look for clues.

807
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,670
Let's meet back here

808
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,430
in an hour.

809
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,990
I, Fed, got nothing.

810
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,150
Lu Lingfeng and I

811
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,590
didn't find anything either.

812
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,870
Mr. Cao's room is tidy,

813
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,770
as if it was rarely inhabited.

814
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,270
He probably sleeps at Qiande Hall a lot.

815
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,710
As for Cao Yin's room,

816
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,510
she's been doing needlework.

817
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,150
It seems she's been getting ready for a baby.

818
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,710
However,

819
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,470
this has nothing to do with this case, right?

820
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,630
In Ding Mao's room,

821
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,660
we found two pieces of women's clothing.

822
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,140
We compared them with Ye Lai's clothes,

823
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,940
and they are extremely similar.

824
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,910
Master.

825
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,870
I found this

826
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,950
in Cao Xiao's room.

827
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:22,880
Xue Huan.

828
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,990
Did you preserve

829
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,180
the one found in Duobao's room well?

830
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,190
Here it is.

831
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,990
Fed, take a quick look.

832
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,710
It's Red Neck.

833
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,550
This branch is no different

834
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,350
from that one,

835
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,550
except for the color of the rhizome.

836
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,810
This is just an ordinary plant.

837
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,310
The ice cream we had yesterday

838
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,350
was garnished with this.

839
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,110
Also, this branch's

840
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,750
rhizome

841
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,540
was not originally red.

842
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,310
It's just it was dipped in

843
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,110
Red Neck powder,

844
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,350
so it was dyed red.

845
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,950
The poison Duobao was afflicted by

846
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,370
is this.

847
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,190
You found this

848
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,910
in Cao Xiao's room?

849
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,350
Yes.

850
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,430
Take me there.

851
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,230
Everyone, split up and look for clues.

852
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,960
The more detailed, the better.

853
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,990
Su Wuming!

854
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,800
Lu Lingfeng!

855
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,270
Where did you find it?

856
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,350
On the dressing table.

857
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,150
It was tucked inside a rouge box.

858
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,820
I'm sorry, Master.

859
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,690
I was careless.

860
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,310
I didn't look carefully

861
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,040
through these cosmetic items.

862
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,190
Let me see.

863
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,700
Red Neck.

864
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,630
She stored so much of it.

865
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,990
How many people does she want to poison to death?

866
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,250
Interrogate Cao Xiao.

867
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,600
You want to interrogate me?

868
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,140
Qiande Hall is my family's property.

869
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,540
You outsiders

870
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,160
want to interrogate me here?

871
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,870
How ridiculous.

872
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,160
Where is Zhang Huang?

873
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,020
Bring him here.

874
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,910
You dared to call Prefectural Governor by his name.

875
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,880
How imposing, Third Young Lady.

876
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,550
Calm down first.

877
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,260
Let me show you something.

878
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,390
This is what we found

879
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,710
in your room.

880
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,160
This is a cosmetic item of mine.

881
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,050
Why did you

882
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,870
bring it here?

883
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,950
Give it back to me!

884
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,910
How dare you, Cao Xiao!

885
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,770
How dare you snatch the evidence?

886
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,110
You secretly kept this deadly poison.

887
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,550
What did you intend to do with it?

888
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,150
You're

889
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,210
quite a dignified-looking lady.

890
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,390
How could you bear to poison Duobao to death?

891
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,610
Sheriff Lu.

892
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,390
Mr. Su.

893
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,630
Prefectural Governor Zhang wants to see you.
