[Episode 40]

4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,470
You two came just in time.

5
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,509
It's best to nail up all the windows at the back.

6
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,070
Otherwise, if I use my Disappearing Technique to escape again,

7
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,710
how will you explain to the prefectural governor?

8
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,380
You're joking.

9
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,150
If you wanted to escape,

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,350
who could stop you?

11
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,510
Besides,

12
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,870
you are not the murderer at all.

13
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,360
Cao Zhongda.

14
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,590
Cao Xiao has already confessed.

15
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,750
My children...

16
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,630
have all been hurt by me.

17
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,950
Although they were guilty,

18
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,590
they were all being

19
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,510
considerate towards you.

20
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,170
The silly girl may look smart,

21
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,980
but is actually muddle-headed.

22
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,630
I'm not a fool.

23
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,370
I realized long ago that

24
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,510
Duobao is not part of the Cao bloodline.

25
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,070
But he is a good kid,

26
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,930
and he looks just like my

27
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,950
first child.

28
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,630
First child?

29
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,150
My first wife

30
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,510
was Situ Mei.

31
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,720
She was the daughter of Situ Troupe's master.

32
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,410
We fell in love at first sight,

33
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,200
and vowed to grow old together.

34
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,430
The next year,

35
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,420
she gave birth to a son for me.

36
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,350
But alas,

37
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,560
there was a great plague in Fanyang that year.

38
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,870
The mother and son

39
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,510
both passed away.

40
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,720
I, Lu Linfeng, am from Fanyang.

41
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,150
I know about

42
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,210
that great plague.

43
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,650
I was lucky to survive.

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,020
Disheartened, I returned to Shazhou.

45
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,150
I remarried and had three daughters.

46
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,430
Later, I married Ye Lai

47
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,040
and had Duobao.

48
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,710
But when Duobao was one year old,

49
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,680
he caught a cold and almost died.

50
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,290
I prayed day and night before Buddha.

51
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,829
Suddenly one day,

52
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,540
I dreamt that

53
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,630
my first son

54
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,030
descended from the sky,

55
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,100
and merged into one with Duobao.

56
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,760
And then this child just...

57
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,750
miraculously survived.

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,550
Ding Mao was scheming

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
while Ye Lai was distracted.

60
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,310
I saw through

61
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,870
their scheme right away.

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,790
But what does this have to do with the child?

63
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,670
On the surface,

64
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,430
I am strict with him.

65
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,040
I don't like him being a broker.

66
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,709
But to be honest, this child

67
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,630
is just like me,

68
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,350
and the most like me.

69
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,480
So,

70
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,870
Mr. Cao, you've never poisoned anyone.

71
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,150
Then how did you know that

72
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,920
what poisoned Duobao

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,070
was that ice cream?

74
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,820
Well that...

75
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,550
Isn't that what happened yesterday afternoon...

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Dad, don't hit me.

77
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,310
Who said I was going to hit you?

78
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,330
Dad, will you be back for dinner tonight?

79
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,990
Distinguished guests have arrived in Shazhou.

80
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,670
The prefectural governor is hosting a banquet.

81
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,110
I have to accompany them.

82
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,720
Then don't drink so much, Dad.

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,120
Come back early instead.

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,650
You've something to share?

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,750
Today, I made some money again.

86
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,880
Let me treat you to some ice cream

87
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,140
as a way to celebrate your birthday, Dad.

88
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,330
Dear brothers.

89
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,070
Xiaoxiao is young and ignorant.

90
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,150
Please give her a chance to live.

91
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,610
Put this murder charge

92
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,510
on my head instead.

93
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,500
I have already lived a wasted life of 60 years.

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,710
It's more than enough.

95
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,750
I don't want to live anymore.

96
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,410
But this child is still young.

97
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,430
I'm begging you.

98
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,650
Please get up quickly.

99
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,870
Mr. Cao.

100
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,890
Although Cao Xiao had made careful plans,

101
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,940
but at the moment of the crime,

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,950
good thoughts prevailed over evil ones.

103
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,590
Someone else poisoned Duobao.

104
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,040
It wasn't Xiaoxiao?

105
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,430
No.

106
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,010
Then who was it?

107
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,350
Who poisoned the boy Duobao?

108
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,950
Master, this plan is truly brilliant.

109
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,310
With just one word 'trick',

110
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,790
you made Cao Zhongda and Cao Xiao

111
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,800
both tell the truth.

112
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,050
Your Master wanted to

113
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,270
trick the truth out

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,510
from one of them.

115
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,230
But who would have thought...

116
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,670
There are only a few people in the Cao family.

117
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,940
The servants are all grateful for Mr. Cao's kindness,

118
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,790
and Duobao treats everyone really well.

119
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,850
It's even more unlikely that they would poison anyone.

120
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,950
Oh no, oh no!

121
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,950
The two disciples of Detective Di are stumped.

122
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,440
Disciples of Detective Di?

123
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Saisai seemed to have mentioned Detective Di before.

124
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,270
Xijun.

125
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,000
Xue Huan.

126
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,040
The three of us were all present at that time.

127
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,440
What Saisai said was that

128
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,680
the disciples of Detective Di are formidable,

129
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,210
or that the disciples of Detective Di are not to be trifled with?

130
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,430
Aunt Rong is a dummy.

131
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,350
She doesn't even know who Di Renjie is,

132
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,590
but I know.

133
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,400
My mother said that Detective Di is very formidable.

134
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,050
His disciples are not to be trifled with.

135
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,430
Sheriff Lu, you're capable.

136
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,270
You must avenge

137
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,100
Uncle Duobao.

138
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,070
It seems that everything has been said.

139
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,550
Yes.

140
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,550
I remember what she said was,

141
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,430
"Detective Di is formidable.

142
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,270
His disciples

143
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,470
are definitely not to be trifled with."

144
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,070
Su Wuming.

145
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,270
Based on Saisai's description,

146
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,070
this sentence

147
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,000
was said by her mother Cao Yin.

148
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,920
I didn't see that coming.

149
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,560
You, Lu Lingfeng, are now

150
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,510
so vigilant and meticulous.

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,610
You can actually

152
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,380
discern the clues of this case

153
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,909
from a child's single sentence.

154
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,910
Wait a minute.

155
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,470
How come I

156
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,870
don't understand anything?

157
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,070
I don't get it either.

158
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,100
Su Wuming,

159
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,580
What's going on here?

160
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,110
This sentence

161
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,670
doesn't sound like something a mother would say to her child.

162
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,830
It should be

163
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,640
what Cao Yin said to Li Chi.

164
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,270
The child happened to overhear it.

165
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,030
And Li Chi said that

166
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,400
after he left Qiande Hall,

167
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,900
he went straight home and fell asleep.

168
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,250
He was awakened by a nightmare between 3 to 5 a.m.,

169
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,470
so he grabbed his sword and left.

170
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,309
He never mentioned to his wife

171
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,590
that at the banquet,

172
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,039
there were two disciples of Detective Di.

173
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,909
Moreover,

174
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,470
Cao Yin and Li Chi's testimonies

175
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,950
are highly consistent.

176
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,990
This indicates that

177
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,390
from the very beginning,

178
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,740
they colluded in their statements.

179
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,270
Master.

180
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,370
So in the end, was it Cao Yin who poisoned Duobao,

181
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,270
or was it Li Chi?

182
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,960
We don't know yet.

183
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,710
It's getting late.

184
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,660
Saisai will be scared

185
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,520
to sleep alone.

186
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,430
Xijun,

187
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,170
go keep her company.

188
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,380
Okay.

189
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,870
Wait a minute.

190
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,530
I have one more matter,

191
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,350
but I'm not sure if it counts as a clue.

192
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,150
Let's hear it.

193
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,470
Cao Yin

194
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,790
is pregnant.

195
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,320
Are you sure?

196
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,950
Although I didn't take her pulse,

197
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,610
I'm definitely not mistaken.

198
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,920
Lu Lingfeng.

199
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,470
Look at this page.

200
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,480
What are you guys

201
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,070
doing here?

202
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,790
You're having a good time, aren't you?

203
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,120
Drinking and feasting so early in the day?

204
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,790
Of course.

205
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,320
I served as a judicial adjutant for many years.

206
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,470
The brothers here in Shazhou Prison

207
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
would of course take good care of me.

208
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,870
I've already written my letter of remorse

209
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,470
and submitted it to the prefectural governor.

210
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,830
I, as an adjutant,

211
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,070
am innocent.

212
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,550
I will not have to eat the food

213
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,280
in this prison for much longer.

214
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,280
Pretending to assassinate Mr. Cao

215
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,430
and then hiding here in this prison.

216
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,640
Do you really think you can escape?

217
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,780
You can't escape the long arm of law.

218
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,110
You've miscalculated.

219
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,670
Didn't Cao Yin tell you?

220
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,630
The disciples of Detective Di are not to be trifled with.

221
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,690
Are you waiting to be tortured before you plead guilty?

222
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,500
You little brat.

223
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,430
Who do you think you're scaring?

224
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,770
You're not officials of Shazhou.

225
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,470
Mind your own business!

226
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,880
Not only are we not Shazhou officials,

227
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,760
but I've been roaming the the country since I was a child.

228
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,550
I consider all evil as my enemy.

229
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,830
I've never acknowledged

230
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,430
the rules of the government.

231
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,730
Sheriff Lu.

232
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,550
Xue Huan.

233
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,990
The two of you,

234
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,030
please step outside for a moment.

235
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,030
What are you up to?

236
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,750
Guards!

237
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,830
Li Chi.

238
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,950
Haven't you noticed?

239
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,350
Here in Shazhou Prison,

240
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,800
those you call your brothers

241
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,200
were transferred away by the prefectural governor long ago.

242
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,430
Yingtao.

243
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,680
Don't tire yourself out.

244
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,270
Why don't I do it?

245
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,730
Go away.

246
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,490
I haven't beaten anyone up in a long time.

247
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,420
My hands are eager for some action.

248
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,630
It's this cabinet.

249
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,390
Open it.

250
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,510
How come the small bottle

251
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,970
containing the poison is gone?

252
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,830
It's really gone.

253
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,630
Besides you,

254
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,270
who else has the key to this cabinet?

255
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,940
There are only two keys to this cabinet,

256
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,790
the otherset is in the hands of Minister Li.

257
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,470
Li Chi?

258
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,990
Is there a place in the city government office

259
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,670
where he works

260
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,980
or rest alone?

261
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,110
Governor.

262
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,320
This is the very bottle.

263
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,790
He's really capable of such things.

264
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,300
[Loyalty and Devotion]

265
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,840
Governor Bing.

266
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,150
This criminal has confessed.

267
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,410
This is his testimony.

268
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,790
Governor Zhang.

269
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
I'm being wronged.

270
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,940
I was tortured into confessing.

271
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,270
I'm Cao Yin, the eldest daughter of the Cao family.

272
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,530
Greetings, Governor.

273
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,590
Honey, you've come at the right time.

274
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,250
Honey, please testify for me.

275
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,040
I want to see the testimony.

276
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,550
Every word of

277
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,890
Li Chi's statement is true.

278
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,160
I ask that you, Governor, to punish him severely.

279
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,920
Honey.

280
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,660
I, Cao Yin,

281
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,630
gave a false testimony to cover up for Li Chi.

282
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,550
I'm sorry for going against my father's teachings.

283
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,680
I'm sorry to Saisai,

284
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,190
and the child in my womb.

285
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,410
I'm even more sorry to my younger brother Duobao.

286
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,970
I request that you punish me for my crime.

287
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,400
How dare you, Li Chi.

288
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,730
As an official of Tang,

289
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,230
you murdered your brother-in-law

290
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,630
for the family's assets.

291
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,270
You scum!

292
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,400
Be prepared for the execution.

293
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,070
Honey!

294
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,390
Honey, save me!

295
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,830
Honey, save me!

296
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,080
-Morning, Mr. Cao.
-Morning, Mr. Cao.

297
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,190
Mr. Su is indeed a man of great talent.

298
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,990
You managed to spot clues

299
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,440
in my will.

300
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,890
Li Chi is a judicial adjutant.

301
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,170
Getting him to confess

302
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,440
would never be easy.

303
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,000
Some extraordinary measures are needed.

304
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,950
Mr. Cao, you may need to step in personally.

305
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,250
As for Cao Yin, that child

306
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,780
has been too headstrong since she was little.

307
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,430
Alas, I

308
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,130
really can't bear to see her heartbroken again.

309
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,340
Dad.

310
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,810
Where are you

311
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,560
taking us to?

312
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,330
You'll know when we get there.

313
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,450
Go call Mother.

314
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,550
Don't go!

315
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,360
Don't go!

316
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,510
Uncle has some candy.

317
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,710
Come, come.

318
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,990
Dad.

319
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,800
Whose house is this?

320
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,430
Saisai.

321
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,590
Go ask

322
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,100
who their father is.

323
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,870
Who is your father?

324
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,190
Li Chi.

325
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,630
Mother.

326
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,270
The father of these two children

327
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,470
is also called Li Chi.

328
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,780
It must be a duplicate of my dad's name.

329
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,380
Saisai.

330
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,100
I have a portrait of your father here.

331
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,390
I painted it.

332
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,350
Does it look like him?

333
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,359
Yes, it does.

334
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,430
That is my dad!

335
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,089
Mother.

336
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,060
-Someone drew a portrait of our father.
-That’s my dad’s portrait!

337
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,579
That's my dad's portrait.

338
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,150
Now do you understand

339
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,690
why did I only leave you with

340
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,230
one tenth of the family's assets in my will?

341
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,190
Li Chi had a mistress long ago.

342
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,910
Dad was afraid that after my 60th birthday funeral...

343
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,440
Dad.

344
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,490
Please say no more.

345
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,650
I understand everything now.

346
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,020
But there's one thing I don't understand.

347
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,230
Was it you who poisoned Duobao?

348
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,110
Dad.

349
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,150
There are no outsiders here now.

350
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,910
Tell me the truth.

351
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,870
If it was really you who did it,

352
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,770
I will take the blame for you.

353
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,230
Dad.

354
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,630
I didn't do it.

355
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,170
It was Li Chi who poisoned Duobao to death.

356
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,470
Although he is a judicial adjutant,

357
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,790
he is very cowardly.

358
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,610
Moreover,

359
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,410
he has the bad habit of sleep talking.

360
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,500
That day,

361
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,110
after he poisoned Duobao...

362
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,780
Duobao.

363
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,950
Don't come looking for me as a soul.

364
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,950
Go find him.

365
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,190
Go to your father.

366
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,260
Who...

367
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,430
Who asked him to be this unfair?

368
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,150
Honey, honey.

369
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,690
What are you doing?

370
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,430
What have you done to Duobao?

371
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,940
You are a murderer.

372
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,150
A murderer!

373
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,950
Are you even human?

374
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,010
Everything I've done,

375
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,550
isn't it all for Saisai

376
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,950
and the son in your belly?

377
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,950
I, Li Chi, married into a

378
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,990
merchant family,

379
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,120
but only got one tenth of the family's assets.

380
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,500
Everything I did today

381
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,690
was all because of Cao Zhongda.

382
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,310
Are you crazy?

383
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,900
I hate that I didn't have the courage to kill myself at that time.

384
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,990
I really don't have the courage to die either.

385
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,050
Saisai is still young.

386
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,870
The baby in my womb

387
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,670
is only two months old.

388
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,510
If I died,

389
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm afraid it would be three lives lost.

390
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,760
Although Li Chi is hateful,

391
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,230
but after all, he

392
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,890
is the father of two children.

393
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,440
So...

394
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,450
So I gave him an idea.

395
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,480
Didn't you say

396
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,260
that two of Detective Di's disciples have arrived?

397
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,110
Don't you know

398
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,770
how powerful Detective Di is?

399
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,270
Detective Di's disciples

400
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,310
are definitely not to be trifled with.

401
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,670
What's there to be afraid of?

402
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,110
I am a judicial adjutant.

403
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,130
But you are from the Cao family.

404
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,110
You need to stay away from the murder case.

405
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,690
What will you do

406
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,110
if Zhang Huang asks those two disciples

407
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,440
of Detective Di to help?

408
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,260
Well…

409
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,130
How did I not think of that?

410
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,560
At this moment,

411
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,230
Saisai was already been woken up by your quarrel.

412
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,960
She didn't know what happened,

413
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,390
but she clearly heard

414
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,150
the words "Detective Di" and "disciples."

415
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,100
Yes.

416
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,840
Yesterday morning

417
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,630
when I was combing my daughter's hair,

418
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,490
she asked me who Detective Di was.

419
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,310
I knew then

420
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,440
that she had overheard.

421
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,730
Disciples of Detective Di

422
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,370
are indeed remarkable.

423
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,640
I thought

424
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,860
the idea I came up with was quite clever,

425
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,760
but I never expected

426
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,030
a single sentence from my child

427
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,930
would become the flaw.

428
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,070
It's all your fault

429
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,290
for coming up with this lousy idea.

430
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,470
If I were still the judicial adjutant,

431
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,720
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

432
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,550
I...

433
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,070
I'm going to kill you!

434
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,510
You bastard.

435
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:05,950
Please

436
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:06,990
enjoy.

437
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,790
Here.

438
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,450
I cannot

439
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,750
accept the money.

440
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,400
Thank you so much, Mr. Su,

441
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,300
for clearing Mr. Cao's name.

442
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,240
Then today, we'll take it as

443
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,200
you treating us.

444
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,110
Of course.

445
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,430
I have to thank you

446
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,510
for providing me with an important clue.

447
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,170
No problem.

448
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,890
No problem.

449
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,460
What clue did he provide?

450
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,270
After Li Chi left the table,

451
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,670
he asked Mr. He

452
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,210
to make him a serving of ice cream,

453
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,610
saying that he wanted to bring it home for his daughter to eat.

454
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,080
But Saisai

455
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,260
doesn't eat ice cream at all

456
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,230
Xijun,

457
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,310
I don't eat ice cream.

458
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,190
You don't like it?

459
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,950
I ate it once last year

460
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,950
and got a stomachache afterwards,

461
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,150
so Mother doesn't let me eat it anymore.

462
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,670
This was the loophole.

463
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,290
This Li Chi is really despicable.

464
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,670
He actually used Mr. Cao's name

465
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,450
to trick Duobao into eating

466
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,850
that poisoned ice cream.

467
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,790
Brother-in-law!

468
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,470
What brings you here?

469
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,930
Father-in-law is hosting guests at Qiande Hall.

470
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,460
He Keke made some ice cream.

471
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,810
Father-in-law thought of you

472
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,210
and specially asked me to bring one for you.

473
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,330
How come you have one here too?

474
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,400
Come,

475
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,410
eat the one your father gave.

476
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,350
Brother-in-law,

477
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,270
this is the one I saved for my father.

478
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,070
I'm waiting for him to come back.

479
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,420
The guests who came today

480
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,110
are having a great time with your father.

481
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,070
They drank quite a lot.

482
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,480
I'm afraid he won't be able to make it back.

483
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,450
How about this?

484
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,510
I'll take your well-meaning gift

485
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,550
and deliver it to him.

486
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,590
Alright then.

487
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,460
Brother-in-law,

488
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,590
the color of this ice cream

489
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,870
looks a bit off.

490
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,830
It's a new flavoring

491
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,300
that He Keke developed.

492
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,220
It has some medicinal fragrance.

493
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,470
The guests who came from afar

494
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,730
all liked it very much.

495
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,590
That's why your father asked me

496
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,630
to specially bring it over

497
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,890
for you to have a taste.

498
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,680
Then I must thank you, Minister Li.

499
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:41,910
By the way,

500
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,170
what did you find in Duobao's book

501
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,070
last night?

502
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,790
In Duobao's red-covered book,

503
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,950
there's a record of a real murder

504
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,670
that happened in Shazhou.

505
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,230
Two brothers fought

506
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,270
over the family's property.

507
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,590
In the end, both of them were poisoned to death.

508
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,830
The fatal poison

509
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,310
was the red aconite.

510
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,970
The one who poisoned them

511
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,820
was their stepmother.

512
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,790
This case

513
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,550
was solved by Li Chi.

514
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,070
According to Duobao's book,

515
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,860
Li Chi searched the room

516
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,430
of the brothers' stepmother

517
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,700
and found the Red Neck.

518
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,230
He kept the evidence in the city government office

519
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,030
and would take it out from time to time

520
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,390
to show off to visitors.

521
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,240
In that case,

522
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,150
the one who solved this mysterious case

523
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,350
could also be said to be Duobao,

524
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,390
the victim himself.

525
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,550
Indeed.

526
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,790
Such a good kid.

527
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,110
It's such a pity.

528
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,490
I kept pondering about it.

529
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,450
The idea that Cao Yin gave to Li Chi

530
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,410
was actually very brilliant.

531
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,390
Before the victim was discovered,

532
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,750
he first exposed himself

533
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,190
for a minor offense

534
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,710
and hid from the arresting officer's

535
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,510
line of sight.

536
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,600
That was really close.

537
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,990
Mr. Cao almost

538
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,750
took the blame for this scum.

539
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,590
Duobao is really a good kid.

540
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,790
A child of Tang

541
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,310
cannot die in vain like this.

542
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,810
[Qiande Hall]

543
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,040
Sheriff Lu,

544
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,270
I brought you some ice cream.

545
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,030
Thank you.

546
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,170
I'll eat them when I get back.

547
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:44,770
Su Wuming,

548
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,270
come with me to see Governor Zhang.

549
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,800
Alright.

550
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,150
I am ashamed.

551
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,910
So ashamed.

552
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,280
I must act swiftly

553
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,530
and use Cao Duobao's death

554
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,310
to put an end to this bad practice.

555
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,350
Mr. Cao,

556
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,150
can you please

557
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,250
read aloud Young Master Duobao's

558
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,710
heartfelt words

559
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,670
for everyone to hear?

560
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,230
The custom of the 60th birthday funeral is centuries old.

561
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,900
I believe that there must have been a reason for it

562
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,840
at its inception.

563
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,430
Those who reach the age of 60

564
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,910
care for the younger generations

565
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,630
and leave the hope of the family to their children,

566
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,390
voluntarily going to the grave.

567
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,750
It is admirable.

568
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,950
However, nowadays,

569
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,470
in the prosperous age of the Tang Dynasty,

570
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,510
our people are well-fed and well-clothed.

571
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,110
The reason why this custom cannot be abolished

572
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,590
is due to the stubborn conservatism of the families

573
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,720
and the government offices' negligence in this matter.

574
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,350
I,

575
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,210
Cao Duobao,

576
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,630
hereby swear,

577
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,070
that after my father passes away,

578
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,670
I will immediately announce

579
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,680
to abandon the family property

580
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,340
and break ties with my family.

581
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Even if I am blamed

582
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,110
for rebelling against my ancestors,

583
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,310
it shall be so.

584
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,910
I will also use my entire life to fight against it,

585
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,200
until the 60th birthday funeral,

586
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,710
this murderous custom,

587
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,370
is completely abolished.

588
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,110
Listen to what the child said.

589
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,920
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

590
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,570
As the prefectural governor,

591
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,270
if I cannot abolish this bad practice,

592
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,690
I, Zhang Huang,

593
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,930
would be letting down the people of Shazhou.

594
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,910
This is the most famous site

595
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,100
of Dunhuang,

596
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,140
the Mogao Caves.

597
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,350
Three hundred years ago, a monk named Yue Zun

598
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,750
came here.

599
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,230
He saw a brilliant golden light

600
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,710
on the opposite Sanwei Mountain,

601
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,510
as if thousands of Buddhas were sitting there.

602
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,090
So, he created the first cave

603
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,430
on Mingsha Mountain.

604
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,830
This cave contains

605
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,430
sculptures and murals,

606
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,310
all beautifully crafted.

607
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,130
Why do you know so much

608
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,430
at such a young age?

609
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,590
I learnt it all from

610
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,250
my uncle's hometown journal.

611
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,580
My uncle had two main wishes.

612
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,800
The first was to abolish the 60th birthday funeral,

613
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,100
which has already been accomplished.

614
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,800
The second

615
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,550
was to introduce the beauty of Dunhuang

616
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,610
to travelers from all over the world.

617
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,490
I want to fulfill it for him

618
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,750
Master,

619
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,110
Mr. Su,

620
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,470
wake up!

621
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,910
The delegation of Kang has arrived.

622
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,770
Governor Zhang

623
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
is urging us to go.

624
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,990
We waited for them at the city gate every day,

625
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,270
but they didn't come.

626
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,750
Last night, Mr. Cao held a banquet.

627
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,910
We drank a little too much

628
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,070
and slept a bit longer,

629
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,270
but now they're here.

630
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,110
The court has ordered

631
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,670
for us to set off immediately after the delegation arrives.

632
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,270
You all quickly pack your things.

633
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,870
Su Wuming,

634
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,790
come with me to the city gate to welcome them.

635
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,270
Okay.

636
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,850
Greetings, Governor.

637
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,170
Where's the delegation of Kang?

638
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,680
They have already left.

639
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,450
Why did they leave?

640
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,040
Aren't we going to Chang'an together?

641
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,950
The delegation was led by the Fourth Prince of Kang.

642
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,850
They received an urgent message halfway,

643
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,350
saying their king is critically ill.

644
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,470
The prince was ordered to return to Kang immediately.

645
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:53,990
So,

646
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,390
they sent a few people to Shazhou

647
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,870
to leave these tribute gifts

648
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,530
of 18 boxes of golden peaches.

649
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,110
Then they turned around and left.

650
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,830
Next,

651
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,350
we will have to trouble Sheriff Lu.

652
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,060
This is the state letter from Kang.

653
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,230
Please keep it safe, Sheriff Lu.

654
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,670
Sheriff Lu, how many men do you need

655
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,030
to escort the tribute to the capital?

656
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,890
Just let me know

657
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,070
and I will dispatch the troops.

658
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,340
Since there are only these 18 boxes,

659
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,470
there's no need to send troops to escort them.

660
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,350
My group of six

661
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,090
is capable of handling it.

662
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,120
That should be fine.

663
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,560
I drank too much yesterday.

664
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,590
Me too.

665
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,590
You and I were both influenced by Mr. Cao.

666
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,780
It was hard to stop.

667
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,260
Mr. Cao donated all his family fortune.

668
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,710
Half of it was used to improve the Mogao Caves.

669
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,270
It not only promotes Buddhism,

670
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,110
but also allows those exquisite sculptures

671
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:17,870
and murals

672
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,690
to be better passed down to future generations.

673
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,150
As for the other half,

674
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,190
Mr. Cao actually

675
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,110
distributed it all to

676
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,590
the poor people of Shazhou.

677
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,650
It's really admirable.

678
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,530
For a merchant to love the people so much,

679
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,750
it really makes me feel ashamed.

680
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,470
You still have a long way ahead of you.

681
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,240
Tell me.

682
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,750
What are your thoughts and feelings

683
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,480
about this journey to the west?

684
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,630
The western region is vast

685
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,780
with thriving trade and travel,

686
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,910
and exotic scenery.

687
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,710
I've seen many things

688
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,350
that I've never seen before.

689
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,990
When I went to Nanzhou,

690
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,250
I only realized that

691
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,130
there are many

692
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,360
impoverished places

693
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,750
outside of Chang'an and Luoyang's luxury.

694
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,810
The people live in extreme hardship.

695
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,429
But on this journey to the west,

696
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,230
I realized

697
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,090
that the important reason

698
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,590
for the people's hardships

699
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,870
comes from the endless fights

700
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,469
and bloodshed in the palace.

701
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,429
It seems that

702
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,360
everything happens in the palace,

703
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:20,790
but actually,

704
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,570
it affects the people of Tang

705
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,969
thousands of miles away.

706
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,080
Perhaps, you will soon

707
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,630
witness a fight

708
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,610
of life-or-death.

709
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,190
You were born into the Lu family of Fanyang,

710
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,670
one of the most noble families.

711
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,000
You excel in both civil and martial arts

712
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,670
and achieved success at a young age.

713
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,870
You were once the luckiest person

714
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,139
in this dynasty,

715
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,110
but now,

716
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,920
you're in the most difficult situation

717
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,850
in the entire dynasty.

718
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,929
After returning to Chang'an now,

719
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,550
you'll be forced to choose

720
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,430
who to side with:

721
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,960
the emperor or the princess.

722
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,470
Why am I so unlucky?

723
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,150
Indeed.

724
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,630
You are also the unluckiest person

725
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,030
in the entire dynasty.

726
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,760
The unlucky thing for me

727
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,950
is meeting you.

728
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,280
The desert is vast

729
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,910
and the sky is limitless.

730
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,230
Why do you have to remind me

731
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:23,830
about these

732
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,290
difficult things of mine?

733
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,430
We are about to return to Chang'an.

734
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,830
What does Chang'an mean

735
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,590
in your hearts?

736
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,190
I was born and raised

737
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,620
in Chang'an.

738
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:38,910
Chang'an

739
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,140
is my home.

740
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,350
In Chang'an,

741
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,340
I met my lady.

742
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,960
In Chang'an,

743
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,990
I also met Master.

744
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,920
Chang'an

745
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,350
changed my destiny.

746
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,750
I had my glorious days in Chang'an

747
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,910
and I was also down and out in Chang'an.

748
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,190
Chang'an belongs to me,

749
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,110
yet doesn't belong to me.

750
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,150
Su Wuming,

751
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,450
what about you?

752
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,310
Chang'an is

753
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,030
a bustling and colorful city,

754
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,710

755
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,070
His Majesty expelled me from Chang'an,

756
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,470
but he didn't say I couldn't go back.

757
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,830
This time, I want to properly

Why don't you leave it to me?

835
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,020

It is precisely because I am a cautious person

that I advise Your Majesty to make a decision early.

He should arrive in the next few days.

897

I just don't know why His Majesty

898
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,110
