4
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,539
Lu Lingfeng,

5
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,030
don't panic!

6
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,150
Brother has made arrangements in advance.

7
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,880
The bandits have been subdued.

8
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,900
Mr. Su,

9
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,710
your strategic planning is impressive.

10
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,910
I, Jiang, admire you.

11
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,320
It's nothing.

12
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,150
Come on.

13
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,800
Let's hurry and think of a way

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,310
to open this door.

15
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,590
Let me.

16
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,240
Step aside.

17
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,790
You actually made it here alive?

18
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,880
How exactly should we address you?

19
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,580
Landlady,

20
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,910
Mrs. Mo,

21
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,350
or treasure hunter?

22
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,750
For a dying person,

23
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,790
whatever you call me will just be your last words.

24
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,520
I don't mind.

25
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,550
Lady,

26
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,960
you lost the game of Tokhara knife.

27
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,070
You must accept the consequences.

28
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,829
When will we have our wedding night?

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,150
Who do you think you are

30
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,150
to take advantage of me?

31
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,390
Hermit,

32
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,040
why did you align with them?

33
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,530
Someone was killed in the remote inn,

34
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,700
turning it into a place of disputes.

35
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,829
As someone outside the secular world,

36
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,030
why didn't you leave?

37
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,750
The one standing in front of you is not a hermit,

38
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,600
but the sheriff of this county.

39
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,000
You're an official?

40
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,180
And a sheriff, no less?

41
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,560
I was so stupid.

42
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,960
I actually spared these people

43
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,840
just because of you.

44
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,730
So what?

45
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,990
Should we thank you

46
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,230
for sparing us?

47
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,050
You were staying at my inn,

48
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,050
drinking my wine, eating my food.

49
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,850
If I wanted to kill you, would it be difficult?

50
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,990
You, little girl,

51
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,550
seem to have some experience in Jianghu.

52
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,070
You tested the water and the wine

53
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,190
with Yong'an Pills.

54
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,990
Wait a minute.

55
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,160
But if I were to

56
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,510
poison your food,

57
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,310
could you tell?

58
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,190
You're quite capable.

59
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,380
You even know

60
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,590
we used Yong'an Pills.

61
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,670
In those two superior rooms you were staying in,

62
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,990
just one night's sleep

63
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,909
would make you blind

64
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,950
by the next morning.

65
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,850
No matter how great your martial arts skills are,

66
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,310
what difficulty would I have in killing you?

67
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,909
Moro incense

68
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,390
can blind people just by smelling it for one night.

69
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,710
You're quite vicious!

70
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,950
In that case,

71
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,300
I should thank you for arranging for me

72
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,700
to sleep in the woodshed?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,920
I could have

74
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,710
easily killed them.

75
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,790
It was all because of you.

76
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,950
When you arrived,

77
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,610
I couldn't bear to see you die.

78
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,030
So I used the Tokhara knife instead,

79
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,910
trying to scare everyone away.

80
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,720
Let me tell you,

81
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,690
Sheriff Jiang,

82
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,390
the moment you entered the in,

83
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,590
the way she looked at you was different.

84
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,270
She has taken a liking to you.

85
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,990
If you weren't a sheriff,

86
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,830
she'd probably want to marry you

87
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,110
and make you the landlord of her Mo's Inn.

88
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,740
Say something.

89
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,830
Your voice is also pleasant to hear,

90
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,420
like that of a celestial being.

91
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,110
Boy-crazy!

92
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,110
You...

93
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,150
really are a sheriff?

94
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,950
Indeed.

95
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,670
As Jiang Wei, the sheriff of Shen County,

96
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,070
I'm now questioning you.

97
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,670
Where are the 34 construction workers

98
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,610
of Shen County now?

99
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,190
It seems you truly are.

100
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,890
How old are you?

101
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,670
Answer me!

102
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,300
Where are the construction workers?

103
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,630
Are they safe?

104
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,159
Are you 23 years old?

105
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,490
If my younger brother were still alive

106
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,950
this year

107
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,159
he would be this age.

108
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,290
When he was little, I asked him

109
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,550
what he most wanted to be when he grew up.

110
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,909
He said

111
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,060
he most wanted to be a sheriff

112
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,470
because the official who catches thieves is the most impressive.

113
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,870
You built an inn in the wilderness above

114
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,910
because you discovered the Vajra Temple

115
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,630
buried underground.

116
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,870
Your aim

117
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,970
is Master Moshi's tongue relic, right?

118
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,370
You are truly knowledgeable.

119
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,430
Once again, you've got it right.

120
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,490
Treasure hunters,

121
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,190
seeking treasures for those who pay them.

122
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,730
It's just that this time, it took some effort

123
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,480
and was delayed for half a year.

124
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,430
You treasure hunters

125
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,150
are no different from thieves.

126
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,350
Even if your brother were still alive,

127
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,070
he would be implicated by you,

128
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,790
unable to take the imperial examinations,

129
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,050
and even less likely to become a sheriff.

130
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,470
Do you think we want to be

131
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,530
treasure hunters?

132
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,470
Back in the day

133
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,030
my dad was a mobile corps commander,

134
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,690
but he was wrongfully framed,

135
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,390
and our entire family was to be executed.

136
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,990
If we hadn't escaped in time,

137
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,870
my dad and I

138
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,310
would have died long ago.

139
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,070
It's just a pity that

140
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,470
my brother...

141
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,900
Those despicable officials...

142
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,310
He was only 11 years old, and they actually...

143
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,290
Since the late years of Empress Wu Zetian,

144
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,180
the court has been in turmoil,

145
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,980
and informing has been rampant.

146
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,310
Even the frontier army

147
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,080
couldn't avoid the influence.

148
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,790
I can tell that

149
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,830
you probably

150
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,400
all are veterans.

151
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,870
Now,

152
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,549
a new emperor has ascended the throne

153
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,830
and granted amnesty to the whole country.

154
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,789
Why don't you try to appeal for justice

155
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,230
and clear your names?

156
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,070
It's too late.

157
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,410
We've killed too many people.

158
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,430
We can't clear our names now!

159
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,110
Who cares about the name?

160
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,790
Following the Treasure Hunting Grandmaster,

161
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,270
the gold and silver we've accumulated

162
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,070
have been piling up like mountains.

163
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,340
Which one of you officials

164
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,470
dares to say you're richer than us?

165
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,160
Everyone,

166
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,590
it was all because that sheriff pretending to be a hermit

167
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,790
looks like my brother

168
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,630
that I didn't kill them all

169
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,470
up there.

170
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,760
Now I have to trouble you all

171
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,270
to take action together.

172
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,500
I am Lu Lingfeng,

173
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,910
the former general of the Imperial Guards.

174
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,040
All you old brothers

175
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,470
once served in the army.

176
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,670
Anyone who hasn't committed murder

177
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,310
can surrender their weapons.

178
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,440
I will do my best to ensure your safety.

179
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,140
I am Su Wuming, a disciple of Detective Di.

180
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,740
I am willing to vouch for you.

181
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,350
Lu, Su,

182
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,950
since you are so eager to die,

183
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,210
I will grant your wish!

184
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,320
Lu Lingfeng,

185
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,870
don't kill those who surrender.

186
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,950
Make this quick!

187
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,210
Leave this woman to me!

188
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,970
Found it, found it!

189
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,150
I finally found it!

190
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,380
I finally found it!

191
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,430
Daughter?

192
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,440
Brothers?

193
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,880
Grandmaster, help!

194
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,890
Grandmaster,

195
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,790
save us!

196
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,110
Daughter,

197
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,550
are you alright?

198
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,480
I'm fine!

199
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,100
I told you long ago

200
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,150
not to be kind.

201
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,960
[Treasure Hunting Grandmaster]

202
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,110
Why can't you remember?

203
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,070
I even gave you winter clothes to keep warm.

204
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,730
How could you say such things?

205
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,430
sir,

206
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,430
how about I give you a piece of clothing?

207
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,230
Bring it here.

208
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,710
Your words and actions

209
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,750
have desecrated the sacred place where Master Moshi

210
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,710
translated scriptures, debated,

211
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,230
and turned a robber into a Buddha.

212
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,500
Moshi?

213
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,690
That old monk was indeed remarkable.

214
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,030
His tongue turned into a relic.

215
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,070
Do you know how much the employer paid

216
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,550
for this small piece?

217
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,680
You were once a mobile corps commander.

218
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,780
How could you let profit drive you

219
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,030
to do such a thing?

220
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,730
What does it matter to you?

221
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,230
The Sogdian businessman in the ancestral hall

222
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,630
was killed by you, right?

223
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,530
I wanted to eat chestnuts.

224
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,880
So I went to the town to buy some.

225
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,830
When I returned,

226
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,030
I saw a red ribbon tied to the gate

227
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,520
and knew that many people had moved in.

228
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
I could only enter via the rooftops.

229
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,970
Let me ask you this:

230
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,590
Where are the construction workers from Shen County

231
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,790
who built the inn now?

232
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,320
The construction workers?

233
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,190
They built the inn for me.

234
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,270
I chose a nice place with mountains and water

235
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,350
for them to rest in peace.

236
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,130
We

237
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,550
owe each other nothing.

238
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,780
You killed them?

239
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,710
That was 34 lives!

240
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,280
Compared to the ruins of the Vajra Temple

241
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,030
that I painstakingly searched for,

242
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,950
a few lives

243
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,150
mean nothing.

244
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,440
You old villain!

245
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,790
You killed too many people

246
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,340
and committed heinous sins.

247
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,960
Brothers,

248
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,790
let's capture him together!

249
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,270
Okay!

250
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,440
Boss, run!

251
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,040
Brothers!

252
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,110
Step back!

253
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,910
Xijun, hurry!

254
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:36,990
Fed.

255
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,690
Do you recognize this beast?

256
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,340
I was about to ask you the same question.

257
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,830
Aren't you the knowledgeable one?

258
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,060
You read those supernatural notes all day long.

259
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,590
What the heck is this thing?

260
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,520
I've never seen this thing either!

261
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,710
This is underground.

262
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,460
Could it be...

263
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,710
Could it be what?

264
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,640
Could it be the legendary Fushu?

265
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,150
There are three fierce beasts underground:

266
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,240
Wangxiang, Boqi,

267
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
and Fushu.

268
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,200
This Fushu,

269
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,810
looks like a pig but isn't quite a pig,

270
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,110
and like a sheep but isn't quite a sheep.

271
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,170
It loves to eat the brains of the dead.

272
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,870
Is there a special way to subdue this beast?

273
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,950
If it takes any longer,

274
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,470
I'm afraid it will be too late.

275
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,380
Chicken Fed!

276
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,890
Why are you looking at me?

277
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,150
I don't have any ideas.

278
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,880
I don't have any pepper with me right now.

279
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,430
and besides,

280
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,230
even if I did, it might not work.

281
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,350
Underground beast?

282
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,870
Brother, what are you thinking?

283
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,670
Cypress!

284
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,310
Cypress?

285
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,450
Think about it.

286
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,230
Why do people choose

287
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,190
burial sites with cypress trees

288
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,820
when burying the dead?

289
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,310
It's to suppress this fierce beast.

290
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,110
Right, right.

291
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,570
Let's give it a try.

292
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,510
Yingtao,

293
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,530
go chop some cypress wood!

294
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,790
And sharpen them!

295
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,170
Lu Lingfeng!

296
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,070
Attack it with the cypress wood!

297
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,620
How is it?

298
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,590
Damn it.

299
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,550
You killed my precious beast!

300
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,950
You committed so many heinous acts.

301
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,820
Do you still care about lives?

302
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,020
I've been a treasure hunter all my life,

303
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,110
respected by my peers

304
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,590
as Grandmaster.

305
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,550
I never thought I'd be defeated

306
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,270
by you youngsters.

307
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,630
Come on.

308
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,150
Grandmaster?

309
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,160
You can't even recognize the Sobering Pearl.

310
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,760
The Sobering Pearl?

311
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,210
You don't know, do you?

312
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,240
Let me tell you.

313
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,320
There are nine legendary pearls in the world,

314
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,150
which are

315
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,500
the Memory Pearl,

316
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,830
the Bichen Pearl,

317
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,190
the Shangqing Pearl, the Qingni Pearl,

318
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,470
the Treasure-gathering Pearl, the Evil-dispelling Pearl,

319
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,870
the Snake Pearl, the Charming Pearl, and the Sobering Pearl.

320
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,260
The pearl held by

321
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,450
the White Brow Immortal you worship

322
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,530
is the Sobering Pearl that emits

323
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,870
a tea fragrance.

324
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,960
You don't know that, do you?

325
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,570
What happened?

326
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,630
The protective pearl originally held by the immortal

327
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,260
was lost.

328
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,830
Later, we found a random pearl

329
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,150
in the tower

330
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,710
and placed it there.

331
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,370
No one took it seriously, Dad.

332
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,270
Weren't you once a mobile corps commander?

333
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,470
Why did you say you've been a treasure hunter all your life?

334
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,930
I was born into a family of treasure hunters.

335
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,800
I bought the position of mobile corps commander.

336
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,550
Later, our entire family was to be executed

337
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,310
because I hijacked

338
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,070
the tribute from Kang.

339
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,080
Landlady, you heard that, didn't you?

340
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,550
Yes.

341
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,320
The court was indeed in a mess years ago.

342
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,910
But in terms of this matter,

343
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,310
he was not wronged.

344
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,310
Your brother's death

345
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,550
was also caused by him.

346
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,620
And as for

347
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,430
all the veterans here,

348
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,870
they must have been misled by him

349
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,320
into the wrong path.

350
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,430
Cut the crap.

351
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,310
At worst, we can die together!

352
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,070
Dad!

353
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,310
You are old.

354
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,410
The next Treasure Hunting Grandmaster

355
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,510
will be me.

356
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,910
Dad!

357
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:10,550
Dad!

358
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,550
Dad.

359
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,030
Dad.

360
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,200
Dad!

361
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,680
Don't even think about taking the treasure!

362
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,230
You fake sheriff,

363
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,230
save your strength

364
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,960
for figuring out how to escape.

365
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,750
Sheriff Lu,

366
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,030
you are young

367
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,780
and incredibly skilled in martial arts.

368
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,580
I admire that.

369
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,910
But you're tired.

370
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,150
Moreover,

371
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,230
I have been studying your moves.

372
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,910
At this moment, if you think you can defeat me,

373
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,520
you are overestimating yourself.

374
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,630
I won't take your life.

375
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,150
Everyone,

376
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,710
farewell.

377
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,340
Dad.

378
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,310
Dad.

379
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,760
As Jiang Wei,

380
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,640
the sheriff of Shen County,

381
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,270
I'm now questioning you.

382
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,670
Where are the bodies

383
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,670
of the 34 construction workers?

384
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,820
In the forest behind the mountain.

385
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,790
State your name

386
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,990
and registered residence,

387
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,950
bind your hands,

388
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,630
and come with me.

389
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,520
If there's any resistance,

390
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,570
you will be killed without mercy.

391
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,190
Hermit,

392
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,910
don't bother.

393
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,110
You really do look like my brother.

394
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,720
Don't!

395
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,910
This deep ditch

396
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,650
must have been caused by a ground fissure.

397
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,200
It’s bottomless.

398
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,020

Your horse must have also

401

perished in this ditch.

402
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,950
This woman

403
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,270
is pitiful.

404
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,080
Showing pity at this moment,

405
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,620
even if sincere,

406
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,810
is no better than saying nothing.

407
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,910
Let's hurry back up

408
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,570

409
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,390
Hurry.

410
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:09,990
Let's go.

411
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,070
You two,

412
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,170
come here.

413
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,150
Give us a hand.

414
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,520
Carry him upstairs.

415
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,990
Watch out!

416
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,950
Why did you attempt to assassinate Lu Lingfeng?

417
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,990
Who ordered it?

418
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,110
Master Long!

419
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,870
Fed!

420
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,250
Save him!

421
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,830
Yingtao's injury is not severe.

422
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,030
Chicken Fed said a few days of rest

423
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,830
will heal her.

424
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,750
Long Tai's injuries are too severe.

425
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,410
I don't know if he can survive.

426
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,710

427
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,550
what did you find

428
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,750
on those two?

429
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,960
Nothing.

430
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,470
Then why did you search for so long?

431
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,400
They came for me.

432
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,030
I deserve to know the truth.

433
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,950
Yes, Brother.

434
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,350
Tell him.

435
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,510
This gold was found

436
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,190
on Jia Buli.

437

This document

438
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,670
was found on Lan Juzi.

439

440

on the document

442
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,350
match perfectly.

443
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,230
I think

444
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,390
these two

445
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,560
are bounty hunters.

446
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,350
What are bounty hunters?

447
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,590
They are people who take money

448
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,270
to kill

449
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,850
others' enemies.

450
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,670
But I have no enemies

451
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,430
Maybe

452
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,920
they mistook you for someone else.

453
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,150
This letter paper

454
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,230
is not used by common people.

455
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,030
It's exclusively

460
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,350
and been stolen by ill-intentioned individuals.

461
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,480
Don't overthink it.

462

If he wanted to kill me,

463
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,720
why didn't he issue a decree directly?

464
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,960
-Lu Lingfeng!
-Xijun!

465
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,040

when the bad times are over will come.

503
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,550
Mr. Su, the same goes for you.

504
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,230

to ask of you.

Please go ahead.

Mr. Lu,

514
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,470
since you are heading to Yunding,

515
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,470
you will definitely pass by Hanzhou.

516
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,990
Could you deliver these relic

517
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,790
to the Hui'an Temple in Hanzhou?

518
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,760

519
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,450

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,600
including Jiang Wei, look so serious,

576
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,790
putting on an act.

577
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,550
What can I say?

578
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,040
You all have official careers.

579
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,470
You don't have a choice.

580
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,630
Unlike me,

581
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,950
I only carry the world and its people in my heart

582
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,470
while freely wandering in the wilderness.

583
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,430
I'm the most suitable person

584
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,100
to release Long Tai.

585
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,640
You admitted it so quickly.

586
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,380
This is not the court.

587
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,410
Yes, I let him go.

588
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,190
What? You're going to torture me?

589
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,720
Come on, come on.

590
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,540
Tie me up!

591
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,870
Long Tai has good martial arts skills

592
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,590
and a strong sense of justice.

593
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,270
May he be on the right path in the future,

594
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,390
becoming a hero, not a thief.

595
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,230
Fei Yingjun,

596
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,590
as former Acting Deputy President of the Supreme Court,

597
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,070
I'm now questioning you.

598
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,710
Do you have

599
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,840
the Sobering Pearl?

600
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,110
Yes.

601
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,240
Why didn't you hand it over?

602
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,750
It's not that I stole it.

603
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,990
I got it by chance

604
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,750
when I was

605
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,650
performing Mi Tuo's autopsy.

606
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,350
Besides,

607
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,720
if I hand it over,

608
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,560
it will be passed from one officer to another.

609
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,150
It'll definitely end up in the hands

610
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,670
of some corrupt official.

611
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,510
So, it's better

612
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,690
for me to keep it.

613
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,360
Brother,

614
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,720
this sobering pearl is unclaimed,

615
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,230
and Chicken Fed loves drinking like his life depends on it.

616
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,230
So if he has it,

617
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,110
it can be considered putting it to good use.

618
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,710
Well said.

619
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Xijun has a point.

620
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,480
Now, Uncle Fed

621
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,960
will never make mistakes due to being drunk again.

622
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,800
That's right

623
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,590
What are you talking about?

624
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,930
When have I ever made mistakes?

625
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,270
How could you even say that?

626
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,840
You lost

627
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,790
my spear.

628
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,430
Wasn't it just that one time?

629
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,800
You

630
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,030
are the great general of the Lu family of Fanyang.

631
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,320
Don't be so petty,

632
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,330
and won't let this little slip of mine go.

633
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,730
Let's go. Let's go.

634
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,230
Don't worry.

635
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,000
The two of us

636
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,030
are the best bounty hunters

637
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,130
and have never failed.

638
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,430
I have finished the documents.

639
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,490
If we fail to take Lu Lingfeng's life,

640
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,570
we will offer our lives instead.

641
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,510
There can't really be such a person, right?

642
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,550
What kind of person?

643
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,750
My master once told me

644
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,930
that in this world, there are so-called cultivators

645
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,510
who have mastered the art of divine walking.

646
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,990
They can walk as fast as flying.

647
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,350
He specifically mentioned

648
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,700
that by using a certain technique

649
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,860
to dredge the meridians and improve blood flow inside the body,

650
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,660
one can achieve

651
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,310
the effect of feeling as light as a swallow.

652
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,500
So they can leave in the morning and arrive at their destination in the evening.

653
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,350
If one temporarily removes their kneecaps,

654
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,150
then they can travel 800 li a day.

655
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,920
One can still walk after having one's kneecaps removed?

656
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,710
Yeah.

657
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,570
It's possible for a person

658
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,230
to run fast through practice.

659
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,030
But traveling 800 li a day

660
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,090
without kneecaps?

661
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,690
I don't believe it.

662
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,470
Yingtao,

663
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,990
your master imparted great martial arts to you.

664
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,250
But this kind of story is indeed absurd.

665
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,520
What do you think, Fed?

666
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,450
I think it must hurt.

667
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,960
Of course, it will hurt.

668
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,550
If there was another way,

669
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,840
I wouldn't be like this.

670
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,270
Are you sick?

671
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,390
No,

672
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,270
what I mean is

673
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,980
that I can treat you.

674
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,290
No need.

675
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,270
No need.

676
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,150
Yu Di's illness

677
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,390
cannot be cured by regular doctors.

678
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,990
Your name is Yu Di, like Yu Di Emperor?

679
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,310
You've got nerve.

680
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,640
Using this name,

681
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,630
are you not afraid of being struck by lightning from heaven?

682
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,510
My name

683
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,270
is different from his name.

684
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,140
[Liu Yu Di]

685
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,070
The same word

686
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,070
but with different characters.

687
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,830
Well...

688
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:18,760
Well...

689
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,190
What illness do you actually have?

690
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,870
Yes.

691
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,790
Tell us.

692
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,890
Uncle Fed is not an ordinary doctor.

693
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,690
He's a miracle-working doctor.

694
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,110
Forget it.

695
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,160
I won't trouble you anymore.

696
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,720
Sir...

697
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,930
Old miracle doctor,

698
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,060
thank you very much.

699
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,510
You...

700
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,230
are quite polite.

701
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,770
I see you don't have a horse either.

702
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,610
Why don't you travel with us?

703
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,170
No need.

704
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,990
No need.

705
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:45,430
Besides,

706
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,760
we may not be going the same way.

707
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,830
Have a safe journey, everyone.

708
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,470
Alright.

709
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,830
Let's not disturb him anymore.

710
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,290
We need to hurry on our way.

711
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,050
Let's go

712
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,110
I...

713
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,710
The great river surges on.

714
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,980
It seems much wider

715
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,390
than described in books.

716
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,150
It's still early.

717
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,320
How come there's no ferry boat?

718
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,470
Let's walk along the river

719
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,750
and find the official ferry.

720
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,590
There will naturally be ferry boat.

721
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,390
You're right.

722
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,830
There are usually official ferries

723
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,710
on big rivers.

724
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:41,910
At major ferries,

725
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,810
there are usually boat officers stationed.

726
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,510
Since it's an official ferry,

727
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,950
there must be wine here.

728
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,370
Drinking is all you know.

729
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,160
So what then?

730
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,850
Do I have to get that Boat Officer

731
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,850
to stew a couple of chickens for you?

732
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,330
That would be perfect.

733
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,870
[Qianchong Dock]

734
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,170
You are a ferryman?

735
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,420
Yes.

736
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,330
Stand up to answer.

737
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,220
It will take another two hours

738
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,430
for the official boat to return from the opposite shore.

739
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,950
It's getting late.

740
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,710
If you don't want to take the boat at night,

741
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,040
you can stay here for now

742
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,950
and leave in the morning.

743
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,560
If you are in a hurry,

744
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,290
there's nothing we can do.

745
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,150
Private boats

746
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,170
are not allowed to cross the river.

747
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,830
Why is that?
