4
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,990
Protect?

5
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,539
I have long wanted to destroy it.

6
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,390
Sheriff Lu, you're awake?

7
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,190
That's great!

8
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,670
I have already informed Mr. Su

9
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,470
and Miss Xijun

10
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,390
that you are at Sheriff Sima's house.

11
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,870
The minor injury is nothing serious.

12
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,680
I was just afraid they will be worried.

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,630
Longzi told me

14
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,470
that you wanted to charge into the Yunding Immortal Steps alone.

15
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,310
That's why I went.

16
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,110
Fortunately,

17
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,310
I witnessed

18
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,350
the impressive sight of the former General of the Imperial Guards

19
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,350
fighting bravely against the odds.

20
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,730
Your Heng sword is not bad.

21
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,030
It's just not

22
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,870
in the official style of Tang.

23
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,480
It's a sword made by a commoner.

24
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,850
It reminds me not to forget the people at any moment.

25
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,680
Sheriff Lu,

26
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,230
Sheriff Sima has said

27
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,060
the same thing you just said.

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,320
Sheriff Sima.

29
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,329
[Two years ago]

30
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,290
Sheriff Sima,

31
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,250
don't be angry.

32
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,550
The place where Jinyu House is located

33
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,230
has been abandoned for many years.

34
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,230
People all say

35
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,829
that if it remains abandoned, it will be haunted by ghosts.

36
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,910
Now, someone has paid a high price to purchase it

37
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,050
and wants to build the Yunding Immortal Steps

38
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,390
to be in concert with the Yunding night market.

39
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,829
Isn't this a good thing?

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,270
The night market is a normal business,

41
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,140
but they want to have

42
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,180
some hunting game.

43
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,980
This is against the laws of Tang.

44
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,030
Can't you tell

45
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,890
what kind of person He Yulang is?

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,750
He came from the palace.

47
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,060
He came to the west by imperial decree.

48
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,360
Where is the decree?

49
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,070
How can he show it to us?

50
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,050
Besides,

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,350
the magistrate has only been in Yunding for two years

52
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,829
and he's about to be promoted.

53
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,470
If it weren't for someone close to His Majesty

54
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,490
helping him,

55
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,350
how could he be promoted so quickly?

56
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,950
Sima,

57
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,590
you've worked in Yunding

58
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,300
as the sheriff for ten years.

59
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,390
Do you know why you haven't been promoted?

60
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,590
The court has long forgotten about you.

61
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,079
In the future,

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,390
Yunding will reach the top with the Immortal Steps.

63
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,750
Isn't it a good thing for both of us?

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
[Yunding County Government Office]

65
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,420
Sheriff Sima.

66
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,230
Sheriff Sima.

67
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,770
Why are you upset?

68
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,360
I had no selfish motives

69
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,470
to lift the curfew

70
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,930
and open the night market.

71
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,830
Even though I run a wine business myself,

72
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,590
it's for the prosperity of Yunding.

73
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,320
Because I never dare to forget the common people,

74
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,040
I always reflect on myself.

75
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,030
But now,

76
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,570
they want to build that Yunding Immortal Steps.

77
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,070
If it doesn't harm the people of Yunding,

78
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,950
then so be it.

79
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,649
Otherwise,

80
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,010
I, Sima Liang, will never agree to it.

81
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,510
The magistrate at that time has been promoted,

82
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,440
while I was dismissed from my post.

83
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,150
I heard that you

84
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,190
had interacted with that He Yulang.

85
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,590
What exactly is his background?

86
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,950
Did he really come from the palace?

87
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,590
Who knows?

88
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,790
He even invited me for a drink a few days ago.

89
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,430
I tried to get information out of him,

90
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,490
but he didn't reveal anything at all.

91
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,350
All I know is that this person

92
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,730
was brought to Yunding

93
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,909
by one of Song Shang's schoolmates.

94
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,909
Could it be someone called Zhao Lei?

95
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:55,670
That's right.

96
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,530
That's the man.

97
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,890
He's from Qinzhou.

98
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,260
So,

99
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,870
you've met Zhao Lei before?

100
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,590
I have.

101
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,990
On the day Longzi mentioned just now,

102
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,720
he was the one who drank with us.

103
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,820
What of it?

104
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,550
Has he also gone to you?

105
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,710
His elder brother Zhao Lei

106
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,170
was indeed my schoolmate,

107
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,720
but he never came to Yunding to look for me.

108
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,790
Song Shang is lying.

109
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,950
Since you have

110
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,150
always been on guard,

111
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,030
have you never suspected

112
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,420
that those missing persons cases

113
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,770
are related to the Yunding Immortal Steps?

114
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,700
Of course I have.

115
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,570
Have you investigated it?

116
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,180
I have.

117
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,880
In that case,

118
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,710
the person who burned the files

119
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,390
must be afraid that you would uncover the truth.

120
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,200
No.

121
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,940
Those files were not burned.

122
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,230
I have them all.

123
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,720
I was worried that the new sheriff

124
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,710
would be in cahoots with those people

125
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,850
and after I left office,

126
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,850
these files would instead be unsafe

127
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,810
if left in the county government,

128
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,670
so I took advantage of when the thieves set the fire

129
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,510
to move them.

130
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,690
Now, I'll return them all.

131
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,440
If you wish to punish me,

132
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,680
I, Sima Liang,

133
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,950
accept it.

134
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Didn't Suo Long say that

135
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,350
Lu Lingfeng is out of danger now?

136
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,550
Don't worry anymore.

137
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm worried about Chicken Fed now.

138
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,830
Xijun,

139
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,750
is this

140
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,920
a model of the Yunding Immortal Steps?

141
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,140
Yes.

142
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,690
You have a good eye.

143
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,870
I thought it looked similar before.

144
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,750
With your verification,

145
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,150
it can't be wrong.

146
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,230
Judging from the antiquity of this model,

147
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,260
it should be at least 20 years old.

148
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,190
The previous resident of this mansion was

149
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,030
Lyu Xianke.

150
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,950
What is

151
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,670
the connection between this model and Lyu Xianke,

152
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,660
the missing Market Supervisor?

153
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,590
Magistrate,

154
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,870
let me toast you.

155
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,870
Sure.

156
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,750
You're drinking?

157
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,180
Why didn't you invite me?

158
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,800
Sheriff Lu, you came just in time.

159
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
The magistrate was just praising you.

160
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,270
You've solved

161
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,830
a murder case so quickly.

162
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,659
Yes.

163
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,860
Song Shang and Lu Lingfeng,

164
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,850
with you two as my right-hand men,

165
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,310
I am

166
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,060
truly blessed.

167
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,750
Come on.

168
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,830
Let's have a drink.

169
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,200
Sit.

170
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,590
Solving a murder case is nothing.

171
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,900
The lost files of the county government,

172
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,150
214 files in total,

173
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,910
have all been retrieved.

174
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,910
Among them are

175
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,590
109 missing persons cases.

176
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,550
I just scanned a few

177
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,630
and found many suspicious points

178
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,560
pointing to Yunding Immortal Steps.

179
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,670
Magistrate Huangfu,

180
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,950
please seal off Yunding Immortal Steps immediately.

181
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,580
This...

182
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,030
This can't do.

183
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,630
The county government and Yunding Immortal Steps

184
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,650
already have a contract.

185
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,310
Song Shang!

186
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,220
I once asked about the matter of your schoolmate,

187
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,150
Zhao Lei.

188
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,530
How did you answer me at that time?

189
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,169
He... he never came to Yunding.

190
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,159
You're lying.

191
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,520
Magistrate Huangfu had not yet taken office then.

192
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,030
It was you who recommended Zhao Lei

193
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,429
to the former magistrate

194
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,309
to run Yunding Immortal Steps

195
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,309
and set up a hunting game.

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,550
This...

197
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,840
What?

198
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,290
Do you want me to find more witnesses?

199
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,620
Yes,

200
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,840
Zhao Lei did come to me before,

201
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,970
but this person is ungrateful.

202
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,370
Ever since he got

203
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,230
the right to run Yunding Immortal Steps,

204
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,190
he disappeared.

205
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,390
Thus,

206
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,870
I was unwilling to admit that he came to me before.

207
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,630
So what?

208
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,310
So what?

209
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,910
Guards!

210
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,190
Here.

211
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,710
I suspect Song Shang

212
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,860
is directly connected to

213
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,350
the missing persons cases.

214
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,230
Arrest him and take him to the Yunding Prison first.

215
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,590
You—

216
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,270
Interrogate him after sealing

217
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:20,910
Yunding Immortal Steps.

218
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,340
Yes.

219
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,670
You...

220
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,400
Magistrate!

221
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,130
Officer Suo,

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
you may leave.

223
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,470
How dare you, Suo Long!

224
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,830
I am the chief official of Yunding.

225
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,610
You won't listen to my orders?

226
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,590
Yes.

227
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,270
Magistrate.

228
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,000
Lu Lingfeng!

229
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,180
Song Shang is your superior.

230
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,660
You want to imprison him?

231
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,810
Lives are at stake.

232
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,760
I can't care about these things.

233
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,840
With me here,

234
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,050
you don't have the authority.

235
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,030
This case involves many lives

236
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,590
and there are many missing persons

237
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,270
at risk.

238
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,280
For special circumstances,

239
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,470
I request for

240
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,950
special measures.

241
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,930
Fortunately, I always carry this secret imperial decree

242
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,690
on me.

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,620
Deputy President of the Supreme Court,

244
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,440
Lu Lingfeng

245
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,970
was arrogant and negligent.

246
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,300
Therefore,

247
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,490
he is demoted to be the sheriff of Yunding in Hanzhou

248
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,350
in order to temper his character.

249
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,470
If he devotes himself to self-improvement,

250
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,040
he only needs encouragement.

251
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,170
If he remains reckless and willful...

252
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,560
Lu Lingfeng,

253
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,640
you can read the rest yourself.

254
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,510
Keep this confidential.

255
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm only revealing this to you because our ancestors

256
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,240
had a good relationship.

257
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,660
Deploying soldiers according to this model,

258
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,870
one can quickly charge into Yunding Immortal Steps.

259
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,790
At present,

260
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,270
the most crucial thing is to act fast.

261
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,620
If we are one step too late,

262
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,280
Fed will be in greater danger.

263
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,160
Lu Lingfeng,

264
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,340
you need to make a decision quickly.

265
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,690
Lu Lingfeng,

266
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,530
Brother is talking to you.

267
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,630
I heard him.

268
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,590
The Immortal Steps and the county government have a prior contract.

269
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,710
As the sheriff,

270
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,630
I have no control over this.

271
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,710
Who cares about the contract?

272
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,860
Are you not going to

273
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,940
save Uncle Fed from danger?

274
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,740
The sheriff is a minor position,

275
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,230
but it's still appointed by the imperial court.

276
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,960
Chu Yingtao,

277
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,560
you're from the Jianghu.

278
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,060
You won't understand

279
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,230
the principles behind this.

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,400
Someone from the Jianghu

281
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,940
indeed doesn't understand

282
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,800
how to keep an official position.

283
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,070
Since we are not from the same world,

284
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,730
from now on,

285
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,520
let's not meet again.

286
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,790
Lu Lingfeng!

287
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,080
You have no say in this!

288
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,540
Xijun,

289
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,890
please don't cause any more trouble.

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,150
Tell me,

291
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,510
what exactly happened?

292
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,410
What do you mean?

293
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,640
The Lu Lingfeng today

294
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,550
is not the Lu Lingfeng

295
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,570
that I know.

296
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,840
Yunding Immortal Steps

297
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,580
is mysterious and unpredictable.

298
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,380
Going there without preparation

299
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,710
will indeed make it easy

300
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,080
to fall into an ambush.

301
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,270
I also know

302
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,430
you were injured,

303
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,750
but aren't you fine now?

304
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,590
Now that we've found this model,

305
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,130
we should immediately

306
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,790
study the military strategy

307
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,990
and defeat them

308
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,310
in one fell swoop while it's still light out.

309
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,230
Moreover,

310
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,590
you've already stirred up the hornet's nest.

311
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,830
Aren't you afraid that those

312
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,150
evil cult members

313
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,190
will escape?

314
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,320
Who told you it was an evil cult?

315
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,350
You've seen

316
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,930
those mute slaves with your own eyes.

317
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,230
They have unknown origins, are all dull-witted,

318
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,200
and can't speak.

319
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,670
Doesn't this match

320
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,920
the frequent disappearances

321
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,300
in Yunding?

322
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,470
It's just your speculation.

323
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,680
There's no evidence.

324
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,610
Then what do you think we should do?

325
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,390
Continue to look for evidence.

326
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,270
If it points to Yunding Immortal Steps,

327
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,670
I'll request an official letter from the government office

328
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,870
to discuss with them.

329
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,250
What did you say?

330
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,070
Did I not make myself clear,

331
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,730
or did you not hear me clearly?

332
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,360
Fed has been confirmed

333
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,270
to have disappeared from Yunding Immortal Steps

334
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,530
and you won't save him?

335
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,840
As the sheriff,

336
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,910
I dare not have any personal interests.

337
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,870
What about Qing Xi then?

338
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,790
It's a murder case intertwined with a missing person case.

339
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,150
Isn't this exactly the reason to thoroughly investigate

340
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,870
Yunding Immortal Steps?

341
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,640
Are you lecturing me on how to be a sheriff?

342
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,750
I know

343
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,030
Huangfu Tan or Song Shang

344
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,260
must be stopping you.

345
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,070
They are your superiors,

346
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,150
but now,

347
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,640
lives are at stake.

348
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,030
Sometimes, overstepping authority

349
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,550
is not a grave mistake.

350
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,880
I heard

351
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,070
Yunding Immortal Steps

352
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,400
was advocated by the previous magistrate

353
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,950
during his tenure.

354
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,350
I don't think Huangfu Tan

355
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,380
will fall out with you for the sake of

356
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,600
the previous magistrate's matter.

357
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,760
Besides, so what if he does?

358
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,400
Lu Lingfeng,

359
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,470
if we can destroy

360
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,230
this Yunding Immortal Steps that has harmed countless people,

361
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,830
then this trip to the west will be worth it.

362
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,500
Shut up!

363
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,930
Have you forgotten

364
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
you are just my personal secretary?

365
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,840
No.

366
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,030
Magistrate Huangfu said you can only be called

367
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,260
a butler in Yunding.

368
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,070
Whether a butler

369
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,060
or a personal secretary,

370
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,910
I

371
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,870
quit.

372
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,580
Where is Lu Lingfeng?

373
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,950
You incompetent fool.

374
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,430
Brother!

375
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:03,970
Halt!

376
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,640
From now on,

377
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,780
you will stay in the county government office

378
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,010
and not leave my side even half a step.

379
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,540
Lu Lingfeng can't be counted on now.

380
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
What should we do?

381
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,470
Before it gets dark,

382
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,390
let's sneak into Yunding Immortal Steps.

383
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,740
If we can't save Fed,

384
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,550
then we'll die with him.

385
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,490
You stick to the original plan

386
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,270
and go investigate that body art store.

387
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,790
Fed is our friend

388
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,810
and our benefactor.

389
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,790
And that Qing Xi

390
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,960
is also a living being.

391
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
We must save them.

392
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,750
I'm not waiting for 10 p.m.

393
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,140
I'll just sleep here

394
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,210
and collect the reward money in the morning.

395
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,720
How about it?

396
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,390
All good.

397
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,790
Here.

398
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,640
Yingtao,

399
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,619
come give me a hand.

400
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,910
Okay.

401
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,030
Let go.

402
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,970
Are you sure you want to do this?

403
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,349
If I solve

404
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,750
this mysterious case to save Fed,

405
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,480
I'll die with no regrets.

406
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,940
It's alright.

407
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,830
As long as you don't come out,

408
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,560
your life shouldn't be at risk.

409
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,580
It's nighttime.

410
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,400
I know.

411
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,350
You know that Brother and Yingtao

412
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,630
are going to Yunding Immortal Steps.

413
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,430
Aren't you going to take action?

414
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
I'm incompetent.

415
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,880
Lu Lingfeng,

416
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,830
I'm going to ask you again

417
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,350
what Brother asked during the day.

418
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,750
What on earth happened today

419
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,480
that made you become like this?

420
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,320
I used to believe in you.

421
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,230
I've never doubted

422
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,690
your courage and bravery,

423
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,990
but now it seems

424
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,030
I was wrong.

425
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,440
Where are you going?

426
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,790
To Yunding Immortal Steps to save Chicken Fed.

427
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,710
You fool!

428
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,250
Sheriff Lu,

429
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,070
how can you say something

430
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,230
so rude to a lady?

431
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,100
It's unbecoming of someone from the Lu family of Fanyang.

432
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,710
Ms. Pei,

433
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,660
I heard that your father is

434
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,340
the former Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Pei Jian.

435
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,660
Since arriving in Yunding,

436
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,790
you haven't revealed your identity yet,

437
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,430
have you?

438
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,270
That's good then.

439
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,530
At tonight's banquet,

440
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,510
let Magistrate Huangfu

441
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,570
and Mr. Song toast you a few more cups.

442
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,690
I'm in no mood to drink.

443
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,770
From Chang'an to Yunding,

444
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,780
you traveled long and far

445
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,120
by his side.

446
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,270
Your relationship with Sheriff Lu

447
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,800
is quite obvious to the eye.

448
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,570
Although he's sitting securely in the county government office now,

449
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,230
he's feeling anxious inside.

450
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,530
If you wish to help him,

451
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,020
you'll need to drink well at tonight's banquet.

452
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:24,950
This man

453
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,840
is the former sheriff, Sima Liang.

454
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,320
He was the one who saved me today

455
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,650
after being shot by the poisonous arrow.

456
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,870
Sima is trustworthy.

457
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,800
Drinking

458
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,630
can indeed relieve worries.

459
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,960
But today, I just had a big fight with them.

460
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,150
I don't know...

461
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,880
Don't worry.

462
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,610
I've already made arrangements for you.

463
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,890
Assistant Minister Pei's daughter?

464
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,310
Lu Lingfeng,

465
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,720
why didn't you tell me earlier

466
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,810
that Ms. Pei came with you to Yunding?

467
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,910
It's my fault.

468
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,830
I didn't want to disturb

469
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,110
you and your assistant.

470
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,870
Besides

471
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,110
my father has already been demoted to Ju County...

472
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,520
Demoted?

473
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,710
That's just temporary, right?

474
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,840
I heard that the officials

475
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,300
heavily relied on by the emperor

476
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,570
were mostly promoted by Assistant Minister Pei.

477
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,580
I believe it won't be long

478
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,270
before your father returns to the capital

479
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,070
and becomes the prime minister.

480
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,290
There are indeed such rumors.

481
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,550
However,

482
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,750
they are just rumors, after all.

483
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,540
Ms. Pei, please have a seat.

484
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,020
Please have a seat.

485
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,190
It is 9 p.m.

486
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,280
The gate will be closed in an hour.

487
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,010
Those who have not left by then

488
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,150
will be considered as participants in the hunt

489
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,010
and responsible for their fates.

490
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,790
It's about to start.

491
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,230
Hurry, let's go.

492
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,630
Don't worry about it for now.

493
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,490
If you leave too late, you'll die.

494
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,940
Miss, you really came.

495
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,390
Since we've already made an appointment,

496
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,520
how could I not come?

497
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,370
But what are those two

498
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,200
strange men in red

499
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,510
shouting about outside?

500
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,590
It's so annoying.

501
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,010
During the day,

502
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,550
didn't you say you knew

503
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,610
the rules of Yunding Immortal Steps?

504
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,310
Yes, I do.

505
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,980
I'm wearing a mask.

506
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,950
But at 10 p.m.,

507
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,620
the hunting game will begin.

508
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,290
I've heard about that too.

509
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,550
All those shop owners fled in panic.

510
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,510
Why didn't you leave?

511
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,430
Don't I have an appointment with you?

512
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,870
That's hilarious.

513
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,820
Even ghosts wouldn't believe you.

514
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,410
You're in cahoots with them, aren't you?

515
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,730
Later, will you

516
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,390
hunt me down?

517
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,950
Miss, you're so beautiful.

518
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,170
How could I bear to do that?

519
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,150
You really are in cahoots with them?

520
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,790
No, no, no.

521
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,910
It's just that the owner of Yunding Immortal Steps

522
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,240
is a good friend of mine.

523
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,200
He likes to get body art.

524
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,310
I never charge him when he comes here

525
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,270
to get body art.

526
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,950
In return,

527
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,510
during the hunting game,

528
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,350
they're not allowed to disturb my shop.

529
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,950
Look,

530
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,790
with so many pigments and patterns,

531
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,330
if I allow people to hide in here

532
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,730
and they get hunted down,

533
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,110
my shop would be messy beyond recognition.

534
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,640
How could I do business then?

535
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,270
Of course,

536
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,150
those who hide here for the night

537
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,690
can't collect the reward either.

538
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,930
The people who hide here overnight

539
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,310
are all women, right?

540
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,670
Yes,

541
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,520
but you're the most beautiful one.

542
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,230
Nonsense.

543
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,280
I know someone else.

544
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,370
Not only is she beautiful,

545
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,680
but she dances even more beautifully.

546
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,110
No way.

547
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,350
Miss, what do you want to get painted

548
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,030
and where?

549
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,310
Peonies.

550
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,270
Peonies waiting to bloom.

551
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,750
Where do you want it?

552
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,760
On my shoulders.

553
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,990
One on each side.

554
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,310
You're not here to get body art, are you?

555
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,230
Since I

556
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,220
risked getting hunted to come here

557
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,400
and it's not for body art,

558
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,000
there can only be one reason.

559
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,510
It's to find someone.

560
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,220
That lady is called Qing Xi. She's a great dancer

561
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,430
and has an unbloomed peony

562
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,890
painted on each shoulder.

563
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,220
At 10 p.m. two nights ago,

564
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,620
she came looking for you.

565
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,270
Where is she?

566
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,650
Why do I feel dizzy?

567
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,150
If you're dizzy, sit down for a while.

568
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,990
Take a rest.

569
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,350
The woman you just mentioned

570
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,440
indeed got the peonies painted here,

571
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,500
but she didn't come

572
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,400
two nights ago.

573
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,550
You got it wrong.

574
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,270
It's easy if you want to see Qing Xi.

575
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,230
Let's have some fun first

576
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,990
and I'll sell you at 10 p.m.

577
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,740
Then you'll naturally see her.

578
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,050
You can take the antidote for the knockout incense first,

579
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,770
but I can't?

580
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,950
Hurry up and tell me

581
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,250
where you sold her to.

582
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,590
Up there,

583
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,680
they're looking for beautiful women

584
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,630
to be female mute slaves.

585
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,240
The buyers are from Chang'an.

586
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,370
100,000 coins each.

587
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,250
How much did you sell them for?

588
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,950
Th-three hundred coins.

589
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,390
Bastard!

590
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,250
How many did you sell?

591
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:14,950
Four.

592
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,280
I promised to sell them

593
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
two more tonight.

594
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,390
Two?

595
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,380
Besides me, who else do you have?

596
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,560
In the cabinet.

597
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,630
Save me!

598
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,750
This bastard Qing Fu

599
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,470
raped me

600
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,870
and said he's going to sell me.

601
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,370
Yunding is a place

602
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,890
with excellent feng shui.

603
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,410
Noble people often visit.

604
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,150
I remember two years ago,

605
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,370
that classmate of Assistant Song

606
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,300
brought an important figure here.

607
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,470
But he can't compare to Ms. Pei.

608
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,590
Drink, drink!

609
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,910
Magistrate Huangfu,

610
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,710
Mr. Song,

611
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,550
I was too reckless today.

612
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,130
I said many things I shouldn't have said.

613
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,110
Now, I'll use Sima's wine

614
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,310
to toast you two

615
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,440
as an apology.

616
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,590
You're too polite.

617
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,530
Since Lu Lingfeng offered a toast,

618
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,410
I must join him.

619
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,230
Come, cheers!

620
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,310
Lu, what matter

621
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,580
are you apologizing for?

622
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,490
It wouldn't be about the Yunding Immortal Steps, would it?

623
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,520
You guessed correctly.

624
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,790
It is indeed the Yunding Immortal Steps.

625
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,790
I'm very curious.

626
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,270
Why does Yunding County

627
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,260
allow it to exist?

628
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,180
Young and impetuous.

629
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,870
I was just as curious as you back then.

630
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,110
But after the Yunding Immortal Steps opened,

631
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,710
I was completely convinced.

632
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,070
Do you think people from all over

633
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,870
flock here

634
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,160
merely because

635
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,620
Yunding is known for its fine wine,

636
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,310
or merely because there's no curfew,

637
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,710
and we have a night market?

638
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,430
No.

639
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,340
The previous magistrate of Yunding

640
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,470
was promoted to the Administrator of Shazhou

641
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,350
in less than two years.

642
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,300
That's because

643
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,960
Yunding's tax revenue is the highest in Hanzhou.

644
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,940
The two pillars of this tax revenue

645
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,150
is the wine

646
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,270
and the Yunding Immortal Steps.

647
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,820
When rich people come to Yunding,

648
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,790
the Immortal Steps is a must-visit.

649
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,670
If you shut it down,

650
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,490
Magistrate Huangfu and Mr. Song

651
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,490
will never let you hear the end of it.

652
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,540
Since you mentioned this matter,

653
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,230
let me say a few words.

654
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,560
Regarding the hunting game

655
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,820
of Yunding Immortal Steps,

656
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,550
Tang has never had such a thing,

657
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,860
but if it continues to exist long-term,

658
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,410
will it disrupt the local public order

659
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,570
and good customs?

660
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,110
You need not worry about this.

661
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,740
Here is the name list I compiled.

662
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,490
I have already asked Magistrate Huangfu to review it.

663
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,690
You'll understand once you take a look.

664
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Up until now,

665
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,850
a total of 306 local ruffians,

666
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,080
good-for-nothings, and gamblers

667
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,950
have died at the Immortal Steps.

668
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,300
I dare not say

669
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,160
that Yunding County is completely free of crime,

670
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,590
but at least 70%

671
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,880
of the criminals have been eliminated.

672
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,970
Over 90% of those with criminal records

673
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,770
have been eliminated too.

674
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,710
When I took office, I judged

675
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,290
that of those who would risk their lives

676
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,220
to make a fortune in that building,

677
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,390
most won't be good people.

678
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,110
That's why I supported it.

679
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,230
I see.

680
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,990
Although some of the dead

681
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,510
are good people,

682
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,560
it's impossible

683
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,190
for something to be perfect.

684
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,300
Thank you for your guidance, Magistrate Huangfu.

685
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,030
You flatter me.

686
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,760
Let's drink.

687
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,070
Magistrate Huangfu,

688
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,910
Mr. Song,

689
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,670
I'd like to

690
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,910
toast you both.

691
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,790
Ms. Pei, please don't toast us.

692
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,030
I've been watching.

693
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,160
We always drink it all in one go,

694
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,450
but each time,

695
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,880
you only take a small sip.

696
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,210
We can't handle

697
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,680
this toasting method.

698
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,400
I only take a sip when toasting,

699
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,620
but the person being toasted must finish the drink.

700
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,480
This is the rule

701
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,880
set by the Princess.

702
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,280
Well…

703
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,710
Last year in Luoyang,

704
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,310
Lu Lingfeng fought against the Meteorite Bear with all his might

705
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,240
and saved the Princess from the monster's clutches.

706
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,750
To express her gratitude,

707
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,620
the Princess invited us to drink together.

708
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,270
During the banquet, the Princess toasted me a cup of wine.

709
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,670
Not knowing my limit, I drank it all in one go

710
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,790
and got drunk.

711
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,070
I fell into the Princess's arms,

712
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,140
but she didn't order anyone to wake me up

713
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,470
and just had everyone continue drinking.

714
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,290
When I woke up, I was terrified.

715
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,510
I hurriedly apologized to the Princess,

716
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,710
but the Princess said

717
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,960
that from now on,

718
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,560
when I drink with anyone

719
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,450
within the territory of Tang,

720
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,670
I only need to take a small sip,

721
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,520
but the other person must finish the drink.

722
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,200
Yunding is certainly within Tang.

723
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,100
When I return to Chang'an,

724
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,150
I will definitely tell the Princess

725
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,400
that Magistrate Huangfu and Mr. Song

726
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,590
took good care of me and Lu Lingfeng.

727
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,880
Magistrate,

728
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,210
I apologize

729

For this journey to the west,

731
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,190
Ms. Pei was ordered by the Princess

732
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,390
to accompany me.

733
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,030
It is my honor

Mr. Song,

the Princess can't compare to the new emperor,

738
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,710
but many of the court's Prime Ministers

739
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,370
came from under her tutelage.

740
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,480
Are you

going to disrespect the Princess?

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,150

00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,480
It's impossible to leave safely now.

757
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,680
We can't let those assassins in either.

758
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,900
If Qing Fu's corpse is discovered,

759
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,390
we'll be in danger.

760
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,630
Heroine, you saved me.

761
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,080
I'll do whatever you say now.

762
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,820
Don't kill me!

763
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,050
If this were a few months ago,

764
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,200
you would have been dead long ago.

765
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,890
Now, we can't bear to kill you.

766
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,190
Look how strong and sturdy this guy is.

767
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,050
He must be worth a lot.

768
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,640
Come on, let's go drink some good wine with you.

769
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,170
Let's go.

770
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,590
I, Huangfu Tan, am by no means a heavy drinker.

771
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,610
As the magistrate,

772
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,720
everyone drinks

773
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,280
when I drink.

774
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,610
Then the people of Yunding who make a living from wine

775
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,670
will make profits.

776
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,290
This is what I call the art of inaction in governance.

777
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:15,910
Well said.

778
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,520
Let me toast you again.

779
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,280
No more, no more.

780
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,380
if I drink any more, I'll get drunk.

781
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,060
Magistrate Huangfu,

782
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,720
allow me to toast you on behalf of my father.

783
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,870
If my memory serves me right,

784
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,840
you visited my home

785
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,810
many years ago.

786
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,230
Ms. Pei, if you hadn't mentioned it,

787
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,270
I wouldn't have dared to say it.

788
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,390
At that time,

789
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,390
I was just a mere sheriff.

790
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,790
I was afraid that Assistant Minister Pei

791
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,350
wouldn't remember me.

792
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,630
After you left that day,

793
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,660
my father said that you had a calm and peaceful countenance

794
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,790
and hidden talents.

795
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,260
He said you would become a pillar of the court one day.

796
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,990
Really?

797
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,190
Assistant Minister Pei

798
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,180
had such an opinion of me?

799
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,630
I, Huangfu Tan...

800
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,350
Cheers!

801
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,520
I need to use the restroom urgently.

802
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,469
Excuse me.

803
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,429
Mr. Song,

804
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,340
the restroom is not this way

805
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,090
I have other business.

806
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,510
I'll take my leave first.

807
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,389
That won't do.

808
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,110
Since when did you get involved

809
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,040
with Sima Liang?

810
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,980
You deliberately got the magistrate drunk.

811
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,020
What are your intentions?

812
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,750
It seems you've figured it out.

813
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,710
Song Shang,

814
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,350
you're planning to report this to the Yunding Immortal Steps.

815
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,430
That won't do.

816
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,910
Why don't you go back and continue drinking?

817
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,710
Lu Lingfeng,

818
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,230
you want to go against Yunding Immortal Steps,

819
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,570
but don't forget about the imperial edict.

820
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,370
I'll dismiss you from your post right here and now.

821
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,630
Mr. Song,

822
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,540
Magistrate Huangfu is drunk.

823
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,780
Would taking something from his body

824
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,100
be considered stealing or robbing?

825
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,260
These things don't belong to Magistrate Huangfu.

826
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,860
This is...

827
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,390
You're a dismissed official.

828
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,790
What good does it do you

829
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,350
to collude with Lu Lingfeng?

830
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,910
You need to consider it carefully.

831
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,110
Yes, I was dismissed,

832
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,480
but being a commoner gives me more freedom.

833
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:44,990
Come,

834
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,480
I'll toast you three bowls.

835
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,750
I won't drink it.

836
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,410
Song Shang,

837
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,080
you only have two choices tonight.

838
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,470
Either

839
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,050
you get drunk and know nothing,

840
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,590
or

841
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,690
I get drunk and go on a rampage with my sword,

842
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,490
making sure you know nothing.

843
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,510
Lu Lingfeng,

844
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,460
it turns out

845
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,820
you already made preparations.

846
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,880
I had no choice but to resort to this.

847
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,460
Otherwise, I would have been dismissed on the spot

848
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,520
and I'd be unable to mobilize anyone.

849
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,350
What is

850
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,810
the secret decree that Song Shang

851
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:15,740
just mentioned?

852
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,910
It's a long story.

853
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,880
Xijun,

854
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,710
please draft a letter for me right away

855
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,420
to Commander Lu.

856
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,790
Explain everything that happened today

857
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,050
clearly and in detail.

858
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,710
I want to go with you

859
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,430
to the Yunding Immortal Steps.

860
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:28,950
What?

861
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,810
Are you worried about me?

862
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,350
But the Yunding Immortal Steps is dangerous.

863
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,150
If you go,

864
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,530
I'll be even more worried.

865
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,310
Well then,

866
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,520
I'll stay here to write the letter to Commander Lu.

867
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,920
You must be very careful.

868
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,430
I will.

869
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,540
Thank you, Sima,

870
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,070
for coming to my aid in time.

871
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,590
Otherwise, I would never

872
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,990
have come up with such a good solution.

873
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,250
Longzi has sharp ears.

874
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,950
He knew you were in trouble

875
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,610
and purposely came to tell me.

876
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:05,910
Sima,

877
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,750
I'm truly puzzled

878
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,430
about this Yunding Immortal Steps.

879
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,360
Those buildings

880
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,870
were first built 20 years ago.

881
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,580
The original plan was to imitate the Ghost Market of Chang'an

882
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,170
and be open

883
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,710
for those who want to do business at night.

884
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,270
However, because it was built in the mountains

885
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,550
and the supervisors cut corners,

886
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,950
the main hall collapsed.

887
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,330
The two sons of the city's Market Supervisor,

888
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,090
Lyu Xianke,

889
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,350
were killed

890
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,280
in the accident.

891
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,270
Wait a minute.

892
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,270
Lyu Xianke's sons

893
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,990
were in charge of supervising the construction project?

894
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,550
No.

895
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,390
They wanted to become the operators

896
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,110
of the Yunding Ghost Market after its completion.

897
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,590
Later,

898
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,500
Lyu Xianke kept leading people to rebuild it

899
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,560
and it was finally completed a few years ago.

900
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,690
But because people had died there,

901
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,490
the people found it to be a taboo,

902
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,910
so the original plan

903
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,170
could not be realized.

904
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,880
At that time, I was already the sheriff of Yunding County.

905
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,620
Considering the geographical location,

906
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,510
the needs of traveling merchants,

907
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,750
and for the benefit of the people of Yunding

908
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,280
who made a living by brewing and selling wine,

909
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,510
I proposed to lift the curfew

910
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,790
and open a night market in the center of the county.

911
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,670
Lyu Xianke strongly opposed it,

912
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,100
saying that I was the biggest wine merchant in Yunding

913
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,870
and promoting this policy

914
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,230
was just for the sake of selling my own wine.

915
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,830
He even went to the city many times to report me.

916
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,350
But in the end,

917
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,080
the night market opened

918
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,420
and his Immortal Steps became worthless.

919
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,650
Until two years ago...

920
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,520
Song's classmate was a smooth talker.

921
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,970
Moreover, He Yulang claimed

922
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,170
to be from the palace.

923
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,990
The magistrate wanted a promotion, so he had to curry favor.

924
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,590
It would bring high taxes too.

925
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,520
In the end, the contract was signed

926
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,800
and the hunting game

927
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,830
thus began,

928
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,410
devouring lives and gold.

929
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,290
Although I opposed it,

930
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,650
he used the night market to threaten me.

931
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,710
Either both locations closed

932
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,840
or both stayed open.

933
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,450
The lifting of Yunding's curfew

934
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,470
benefited the people

935
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,530
and boosted trade.

936
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
This was my greatest achievement

937
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,440
in my 12 years as an official.

938
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,970
How could I bear to close it?

939
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,040
I could only endure it until now.

940
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,410
Since you've seen the model,

941
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,530
you should be quite familiar

942
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,390
with the Yunding Immortal Steps.

943
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,320
Then let's split up.

944
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:10,790
Longzi,

945
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,290
Pang San'er, Ma Xi.

946
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,470
Yes.

947
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,430
These three have snuck into the Yunding Immortal Steps

948
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,760
from the back mountain with me many times.

949
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,510
There should be assassins hiding

950
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,080
in the main hall and the surrounding buildings.

951
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,810
The crossbow that hit you today

952
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,910
was their doing.

953
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,920
If we want to take down the Yunding Immortal Steps in one go,

954
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,250
we must first eliminate these assassins.

955
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,030
You three,

956
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,470
cooperate with Sheriff Lu.

957
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:31,990
Yes.

958
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,950
Sima,

959
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,520
I'll leave the assassins

960
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,400
to you then.

961
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,950
As the Sheriff of Yunding County,

962
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,810
I should lead the frontal assault

963
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,020
for it to have a deterring effect.

964
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,450
Have you forgotten about

965
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,560
the so-called rules of Yunding Immortal Steps?

966
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,160
Lu,

967
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,410
once I put on the mask,

968
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,310
I will be the current Sheriff of Yunding County.

969
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,190
What,

970
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,110
you don't feel assured leaving so many men

971
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,110
under my command?

972
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,790
No, Sima.

973
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,470
Say no more.

974
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,960
If we want to destroy the Yunding Immortal Steps,

975
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,860
we must take down the leader first.

976
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,980
Don't they understand

977
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,110
this principle too?

978
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,590
I will charge in from the front

979
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,230
to draw out their forces for you.

980
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,140
You can appear if anything happens to me.

981
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,070
That will have a deterring effect.

982
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,790
No.

983
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,730
It's settled.

984
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,830
I'm just a commoner.

985
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,760
My death would be of no great loss,

986
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,950
but you are the current Sheriff of Yunding.

987
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,950
If anything happens to you,

988
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,750
this battle will surely be lost.

989
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,250
And if Song Shang turns on us too,

990
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,450
what will you do then?

991
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,720
Listen to me.

992
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,320
Let's split up here.

993
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,480
Sheriff Lu,

994
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,030
come with us.

995
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,210
There's a shortcut here.

996
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,950
Everyone,

997
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,450
follow me, the Sheriff,

998
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,990
into the Yunding Immortal Steps.

999
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,190
Those who fall behind

1000
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
during this march

1001
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:07,480
will be executed!

1002
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,070
Yes, sir!

1003
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,610
Sent by Qing Fu?

1004
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,220
Yes.

1005
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,310
He promised two,

1006
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,630
but he only sent one.

1007
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,390
I guess he couldn't bear

1008
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,550
to part with the other one.

1009
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,210
That lustful Qing Fu.

1010
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,910
One day, I'll make him into a mute slave too

1011
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,870
and have him paint nonstop.

1012
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,550
Miss,

1013
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,810
you're not the most beautiful,

1014
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,820
but you are still quite likable.

1015
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,510
Once you become obedient,

1016
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,460
I'll be your first Master.

1017
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,630
What are you going to do?
