[Dunhuang, Mogao Caves]

5
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,590
Mogao Caves,

6
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,920
the place that I even dream about.

7
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,110
Hundreds of caves

8
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,580
were dug into the cliffs,

9
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,590
yet there are no signs of collapse.

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,450
It's a miracle.

11
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,390
In most of these caves,

12
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,850
tunnels are first dug out,

13
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,030
then dug diagonally upwards to form the roofs,

14
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,670
and then dug downwards.

15
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,110
The water immersion method is also used,

16
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,310
which makes it both safe and easy to dig.

17
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,570
It'll never collapse.

18
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,670
Little kid,

19
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,400
you know quite a lot.

20
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,700
You just arrived, right?

21
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,030
Let me tell you about it.

22
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,910
Shazhou governs

23
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,110
the two counties of Dunhuang and Shouchang.

24
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,190
The city ahead

25
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,030
is both the capital of Shazhou

26
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,829
and the county seat of Dunhuang.

27
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,550
Dunhuang, the precious land,

28
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,270
connects the entire Western Region.

29
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,230
All roads converge here.

30
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,510
So envoys can be seen here

31
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,990
and merchants come and go ceaselessly.

32
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,990
These Mogao Caves

33
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,630
are the soul of Dunhuang.

34
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,710
By the way,

35
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,310
three hundred years ago,

36
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,760
there was a monk named Yue Zun

37
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,870
who traveled here.

38
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,400
He saw this Sanwei Mountain

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,110
emanating myriads of golden light,

40
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,170
as if 1,000 Buddhas were meditating.

41
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,190
So

42
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,450
on the cliff of this Mingsha Mountain,

43
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,100
he carved out the first cave.

44
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,110
There are sculptures in the cave,

45
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,590
all extremely exquisite.

46
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,510
Just the murals

47
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,370
can be divided into

48
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,230
portraits, narrative paintings,

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,510
and sutra paintings.

50
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,290
Among them,

51
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,710
narrative paintings can be divided into

52
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,750
Buddhism founder's stories,

53
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,700
etiological stories,

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,630
Jataka stories,

55
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,030
and historical stories.

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,310
Ruru Jataka,

57
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,230
Conversion of the Five Hundred Bandits,

58
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,510
and Maitreya Sutra

59
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,790
are some of our ultimate treasures.

60
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,070
If you want detailed explanations,

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,910
why don't you pay for it?

62
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,670
He's such a good speaker.

63
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,750
We should pay him.

64
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,750
Here.

65
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,630
Take it.

66
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,070
No thanks.

67
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,690
I won't take the money.

68
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,510
Is it too little?

69
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:57,350
No.

70
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,390
I'd give a brief introduction

71
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,990
to any foreign guests I meet,

72
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,950
to be a good host.

73
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,840
Only if you

74
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,930
want further detailed explanations

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,270
or a tour around

76
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,230
the caves

77
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,520
do you need to pay me.

78
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,670
Then why don't you first tell us

79
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,230
what's good to eat and drink

80
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,030
here?

81
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,430
Our most famous fruit is

82
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,630
the Liguang apricot.

83
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,079
Our delicacies include

84
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,029
Xi pancakes,

85

cumin buns,

91
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,420
and Jinsha sliced chicken.

92
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,830
They're all delicious.

93
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,390
Your introduction

94
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,750
made me hungry.

95
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,710
Can you accept the money now?

96
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,070
No.

97
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,390
I can't accept the money.

98
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,030
I've done too little for you.

99
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,060
Well...

100
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,950
How about this?

101
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,330

I'm Duobao.

109
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,930
you can come to me.

110
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,010
Just ask any kid for Duobao,

111
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,040
[Duobao]

112
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,650

114

and you can find me.

115
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,220
Duobao.

116
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,800
Nice name.

117
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,710
Thank you.

118
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,230
In the desert ahead,

119
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,650
there's even a spring.

120
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,850
We call it the sand well.

121
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,659
But it looks like the crescent moon.

122
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,940
So I secretly named it

123
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,630
Crescent Spring.

124
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,570
But it hasn't caught on yet.

125
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,350
Before you enter the city,

126
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,010
you'll go through a sand dune.

127
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,950
You can surf there.

128
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
This is a special

130
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,990
Sand surfing?

131
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,930
I didn't expect Dunhuang to be so fun.

133
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,670

135
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,670
Take them all.

136
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,950
No.

137
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,470
These are enough.

138
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,350
Take your time.

139
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,570
I'll get going.

140
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,070

141

144

Look.

145
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,610
This painting looks a lot like Duobao.

146
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,070
It does look like him.

147
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,330
Unfortunately, it's not him.

148
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,550
That kid's out

149
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,070
to make a living at such a young age.

150
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,590
He must be from a poor family.

151
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,880
He's not qualified to be on murals.

152
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,370
This man

153
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,670
looks old

154
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,030
but even painted his nails.

155
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,710
It's not odd.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,200

157
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,310

Look.

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,590
Look at this row of people.

161
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,620
They're providers.

162
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,430
They're also called the cave masters

163
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,690
or merit masters.

164

166
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,790
This cave that Duobao brought us to

167
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,430
should be a family cave.

168
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,710
A provider

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,120
is a master of the family,

196
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,230
"Have a safe Dragon Boat Festival."

197
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,430
Dragon Boat Festival

198
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,070
has existed since ancient times.

199
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,440
It's a festival

200
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,870
and a happy day for the people.

201
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,910
As a festival,

202
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,110
it's already surpassed

203
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,710
its original significance.

204
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,590
So, on this day,

205
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,550
what's wrong with a greeting

206
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,430
of happiness?

207
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,600
Why should we change it?

208
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,950
As expected from a descendant of the Lu family of Fan Yang

209
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,470
and Detective Di's disciple who's earned merits

210
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,860
with His Majesty.

211
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
That makes sense.

212
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,780
Happy

213
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,330
or safe,

214
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,640
both are blessings.

215
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,520
There's no need to restrict it.

216
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,470
By the way,

217
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,240
we temporarily don't have an administrator,

218
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,560
and our military commander went to Guazhou for work.

219
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,230
This is Li Chi, our judicial adjutant.

220
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,520
[Judicial Adjutant, Li Chi]

221
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,790
Greetings.

222
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,670
The governor has been planning it for a year,

223
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,640
but Sheriff Lu

224
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,710
rejected it as soon as we met.

225
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,590
As expected of

226
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,110
the former general of the Imperial Guards

227
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,980
and former Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

228
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,700
It seems

229
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,930
you know me well, Minister Li.

230
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,270
Of course.

231
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,510
The former administrator of Shazhou

232
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,910
was once the magistrate of Yunding County.

233
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,190
It seems he was dismissed

234
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,750
because of some petty

235
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,810
Yunding Immortal Steps case.

236
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,590
A mere sheriff like you

237
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,510
can be so powerful.

238
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,270
It really

239
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,870
enlightened me.

240
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,830
Watch it.

241
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,620
I am not that powerful.

242
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,050
It's just that His Majesty is wise

243
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,880
and the court never indulges corrupt officials.

244
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,290
Governor.

245
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,910
Has the delegation of Kang

246
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,040
arrived in Shazhou?

247
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,470
Not yet.

248
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,730
I think it'll take a week or so.

249
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,150
In my opinion,

250
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,280
Lu Lingfeng

251
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,190
is just a mere sheriff,

252
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,990
but he also has his family members.

253
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,110
Next, let me

254
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,830
introduce them to you.

255
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,430
Please.

256
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,110
This is

257
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,150
the former Deputy President of the Supreme Court

258
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,550
and a Detective Di's disciple, Su Wuming.

259
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,990
I've heard a lot about you.

260
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,250
Greetings, Governor.

261
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,270
This is

262
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,080
the daughter of the Assistant Minister of Personnel,

263
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,090
Pei Xijun.

264
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,710
This is a descendant of Duke of Henan Chu Suiliang,

265
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,350
Chu Yingtao.

266
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,010
Greetings.

267
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,390
This is General Xue Rengui's great-grandson,

268
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,240
Xue Huan.

269
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,710
Lastly,

270
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,070
let me

271
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,350
introduce myself.

272
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,270
I'm Handsome Fed,

273
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,600
the disciple of the King of Medicine Sun Simiao.

274
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,550
Where are we

275
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,020
staying at these days?

276
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,970
Is it a banquet every three days

277
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,750
or every day?

278
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,770
That's up to you.

279
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,150
This...

280
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,700
Sure.

281
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,950
Mr. Fed, I've checked.

282
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,510
You'll live and eat in Qiande Hall,

283
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,350
the best place in Shazhou.

284
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,390
That's more like it.

285
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,300
Get someone to get the horses now!

286
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:06,870
Yes.

287
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,630
Go get the horses now.

288
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,230
Go.

289
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,980
Sheriff Lu.

290
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,350
You're all Shazhou's esteemed guests.

291
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:14,830
Please.

292
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,670
Please.

293
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,930
Everyone, come to me.

294
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,040
[Qiande Hall]

295
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,030
One for everyone.

296
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,870
Don't push.

297
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,280
Move along.

298
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,350
Move along.

299
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:37,790
Hurry.

300
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,750
Take it.

301
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,650
Are they helping the refugees?

302
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,110
I don't see them giving out porridge.

303
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,510
Such a big piece of beef

304
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,140
and a whole bag of flatbread.

305
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,540
It sure doesn't look like disaster relief.

306
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,180
And cloth too.

307
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,750
Mr. Cao gave more cloth

308
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,730
this year.

309
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,190
It's enough to make a set each

310
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,650
for my two grandchildren.

311
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,070
Yes.

312
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,850
Governor, who is he?

313
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,380
[Cao Zhongda, the richest man in Shazhou]

314
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,550
The richest man in this city

315
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,790
who does pawnshop business, Cao Zhongda.

316
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,120
People call him Mr. Cao.

317
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,330
He is also the leader of a trading company.

318
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,630
He was the first provider

319
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,440
on the wall of the cave.

320
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,390
What pawnshop business?

321
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,230
It's where

322
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,300
he provides storage for gold, silver,

323
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,380
or valuable items.

324
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,990
If you want to do business,

325
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,230
you can borrow money from him.

326
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,670
Mr. Cao

327
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,430
is also Minister Li's father-in-law.

328
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,950
Yes, I'm Mr. Cao's

329
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,510
eldest son-in-law.

330
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:36,910
Also,

331
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,150
this is not disaster relief.

332
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,590
Under our governor,

333
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,550
there are no refugees in Shazhou.

334
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,310
These are all gifts

335
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,160
to the Shazhou people from my father-in-law.

336
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,390
He'd do this annually

337
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,450
during festivals.

338
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,240
Take that old lady just now.

339
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,150
Since her grandson was born,

340
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,410
I bet she's never bought any cloth.

341
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,270
She waits for my father-in-law's

342
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,190
gifting period

343
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,150
to make clothes for the kids.

344
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,190
For today, I heard

345
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,350
he prepared thousands of catties of beef

346
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,990
and over 10,000 pieces of flatbread.

347
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,990
He does look like a kind man.

348
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,830
I want to befriend

349
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,780
your father-in-law.

350
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,590
You?

351
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,820
What's wrong with me?

352
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,070
Qiande Hall

353
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,090
is Mr. Cao's private restaurant.

354
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,750
He will entertain you

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,070
when you get there.

356
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,470
I'll introduce him to you then.

357
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,800
Governor Zhang.

358
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,910
Esteemed guests.

359
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,390
My master is still busy.

360
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,710
Please forgive us

361
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,110
for not hosting you well.

362
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,590
Come with me first.

363
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,120
Okay.

364
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
This is the butler, Ding Mao.

365
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,990
When my father-in-law

366
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,630
entertains guests,

367
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,590
he always comes to receive them.

368
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,220
[Butler, Ding Mao]

369
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,110
Everyone,

370
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,450
please.

371
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,070
Mr. Cao.

372
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,860
Disciples of Detective Di,

373
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,590
the daughter of the Assistant Minister of Personnel,

374
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,120
the descendant of Duke Chu,

375
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,710
and General Xue's great-grandson.

376
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,370
And you are

377
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,440
King of Medicine's disciple.

378
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,470
We are

379
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,710
honored to have you here today.

380
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,150
Yes.

381
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,400
Greetings, Mr. Cao.

382
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,830
Thank you.

383
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,830
Thank you.

384
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,550
Mr. Cao.

385
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,030
Are you being earnest

386
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,680
or pretending to be polite?

387
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,150
What do you mean?

388
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,550
Your son-in-law

389
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,520
is a mere judicial adjutant,

390
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,660
yet he's so arrogant.

391
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,870
But

392
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,830
a charitable man like you

393
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,990
is so humble.

394
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,240
This makes me

395
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,550
perplexed.

396
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,980
Father-in-law, I...

397
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,140
In the governor's presence,

398
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,750
you neglected the esteemed guests.

399
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,510
You're not tarnishing

400
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,310
your reputation or mine

401
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,200
but Shazhou's.

402
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,560
Apologize to the esteemed guests now.

403
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,790
Mr. Fed.

404
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,850
I'm sorry to have offended you outside the city gate.

405
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,780
As an old man,

406
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,910
please be magnanimous.

407
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,980
Old man?

408
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,150
Am I old?

409
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,300
Don't you know how to address him?

410
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,070
Call him Physician Fed.

411
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,790
I misspoke.

412
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,550
Father-in-law.

413
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,380
It's hard to verify if he's really

414
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,590
King of Medicine's disciple.

415
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,140
Besides,

416
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,150
even if it's true,

417
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,390
it doesn't guarantee he's a miracle doctor.

418
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,510
As a judicial adjutant,

419
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,150
do you not know

420
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,750
about them saving mute slaves

421
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,910
in Yunding?

422
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,150
What have you

423
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,510
been doing?

424
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,230
Mr. Cao, you know about

425
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,750
what I did in Yunding?

426
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,270
News of your good deeds in Yunding

427
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,240
have spread throughout the world.

428
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,480
I am

429
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,400
not blind or deaf.

430
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,490
Of course I know it.

431
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,430
Physician Fed, not only did you cure

432
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,550
Yunding's mute slaves,

433
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,740
but you even gave out

434
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,600
the treatment method and precious prescription for free.

435
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,230
Tell me.

436
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,010
This kind of merit

437
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,230
should be painted in the caves

438
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,000
and be passed down forever.

439
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,050
Well...

440
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,780
Governor.

441
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,510
I'd like to invite

442
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,829
Physician Fed to tonight's banquet.

443
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,170
What do you think?

444
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,720
As you say, Mr. Cao.

445
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,150
Oh, how can I accept this?

446
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,880
Governor Zhang, please.

447
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,270
You're the head of the house. You first.

448
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,350
You represent the city.

449
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,230
I'm just a merchant.

450
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,810
How dare I propose a toast in front of you?

451
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,660
I'm already uncomfortable

452
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,470
being in the seat of honor.

453
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,790
Don't make things hard for me.

454
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,510
Go on.

455
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,780
In the great land of Dunhuang

456
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,860
in the great Tang,

457
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,310
we have Mr. Cao

458
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,790
as the host

459
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,000
on a beautiful day of the Dragon Boat Festival.

460
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,670
Ladies and gentlemen.

461
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,980
Let's drink this cup together.

462
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,350
Please try the sliced chicken.

463
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,940
Please.

464
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,750
I, Fed, love chicken the most.

465
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,500
I'm even titled Chicken Fed.

466
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,750
But I didn't expect

467
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,930
to have such good chicken

468
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,250
in my lifetime.

469
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,070
Is this

470
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,670
seasoning too spicy?

471
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,920
Don't worry.

472
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,710
Eat more.

473
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,510
The next dish

474
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,390
relieves spiciness.

475
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,150
Come on, please.

476
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,950
Please.

477
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,030
What is this?

478
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,910
It's sweet and cold.

479
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,830
It's really good.

480
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,890
This is called ice cream.

481
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,830
If you eat it in midsummer,

482
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,770
it will be more delicious.

483
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,630
I've never

484
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,590
had such delicious food before.

485
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,630
Sheriff Lu, it's not odd that you haven't tried it.

486
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,560
Without Mr. Cao,

487
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,790
this dish wouldn't exist.

488
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,750
Governor Zhang, you're exaggerating.

489
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,680
Mr. Cao, don't be so modest.

490
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,830
This ice cream

491
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,290
was invented by a small stall vendor.

492
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,180
It's a pity

493
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,780
that when it was launched,

494
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,640
nobody cared

495
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,870
and business was bad.

496
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,300
He even lost all his capital.

497
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,160
His parents happened to die then,

498
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,310
and he had no money to bury them.

499
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,170
So, this vendor

500
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,150
wanted to sell himself

501
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,560
to bury his parents.

502
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,830
At this moment,

503
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,670
Mr. Cao got the pawnshop to lend him money.

504
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,350
A loan

505
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,430
without interest.

506
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,790
It's really hot

507
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,310
in Shazhou.

508
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,870
I just hope

509
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,990
this delicacy

510
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,860
can relieve a bit of the heat

511
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,510
when people visit Shazhou.

512
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,630
By the way,

513
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,910
the vendor who makes this dish

514
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,590
has become a big boss now.

515
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,430
Ding Mao.

516
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,030
Is Mr. He here?

517
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,030
Yes.

518
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,310
Greetings, Governor Zhang.

519
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,880
Greetings, Mr. Cao.

520
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,990
Greetings, esteemed guests.

521
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,990
I'm He Keke.

522
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,940
I make ice cream for a living.

523
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,630
I wonder

524
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,130
if you like the ice cream today?

525
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,220
Delicious!

526
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,270
Mr. He.

527
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,950
This ice cream is delicious.

528
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,700
If you can sell it in Chang'an,

529
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,360
it will become really famous.

530
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,190
If you plan to do so,

531
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,670
I can help find a place

532
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,470
to open a branch in the busiest street

533
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,390
in Chang'an.

534
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,210
How's that?

535
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,790
A branch in Chang'an?

536
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,570
That's great news. I've been thinking about it.

537
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,070
Mr. Cao.

538
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,150
If you're always around

539
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,690
and keep taking care of me,

540
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,660
maybe our ice cream

541
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,040
can really be sold to Chang'an.

542
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,990
Mr. Cao!

543
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,150
Keke.

544
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,790
What are you doing?

545
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,590
The guests are still here.

546
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,140
Hurry and get up.

547
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,830
Be good

548
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,630
and go run your business.

549
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,090
Tomorrow morning,

550
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,790
I'll come wish you a happy birthday.

551
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,150
Mr. Cao.

552
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,310
Did Mr. He just say

553
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,690
it's your birthday tomorrow?

554
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,990
Yes.

555
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,950
After tonight,

556
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,390
I'll be 60.

557
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,310
Then we will

558
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,630
wish you in advance.

559
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,200
-Mr. Cao, happy birthday.
-Mr. Cao, happy birthday.

560
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,910
Actually,

561
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,470
it's no big deal.

562
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,880
Tomorrow

563
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,350
is my birthday

564
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,740
and the day I advance towards death.

565
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,790
Mr. Cao.

566
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,340
You look healthy

567
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,630
and in good spirits.

568
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,950
How could you...

569
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,950
That's right.

570
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,760
Tell me if you have any illness.

571
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,750
If I can't cure you,

572
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,320
I will never call myself a miracle doctor.

573
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,080
What's troubling you, Mr. Cao?

574
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,870
No one can save Mr. Cao.

575
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,750
Who allowed you to speak?

576
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,350
As Mr. Cao's son-in-law,

577
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,370
how could you say that?

578
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,830
Why are you yelling when you know nothing?

579
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,340
Mr. Cao.

580
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,950
Physician Fed.

581
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,670
Don't get angry.

582
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,950
Li Chi is right.

583
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,320
Have you heard of

584
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,310
the 60th birthday funeral?

585
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,340
Is that

586
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,390
your family's custom?

587
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,790
Su Wuming.

588
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,400
What is the 60th birthday funeral?

589
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,270
It means that

590
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,190
when an elderly

591
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,150
passes their 60th birthday,

592
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,060
they'll have to enter

593
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,510
a tomb built in advance.

594
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,110
This custom was born

595
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,510
from the ancient times of hardship.

596
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,760
Later, in chaotic times

597
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,110
when food and clothes were scarce,

598
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,310
to let their children and grandchildren

599
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,630
survive,

600
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,000
the elderly would willingly

601
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,710
or be forced to enter the tomb.

602
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,710
What Mr. Su said is

603
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,880
an earthern jar tomb or a death cellar,

604
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,510
a tomb that's not sealed off.

605
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,420
When an elder goes in,

606
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,430
their descendants deliver food every day.

607
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,910
They also

608
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,410
have to bring a brick.

609
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,590
Each time when they leave, they've to place a brick

610
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,120
at the entrance of the tomb,

611
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,070
until the tomb

612
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,470
is sealed shut.

613
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,920
My family's custom

614
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,030
has long changed in Shazhou.

615
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,030
Tomorrow, I'm going to

616
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,960
a cave that has been dug beforehand.

617
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,330
But it's a prosperous era now.

618
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,600
Why should you still

619
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,110
follow such a family custom?

620
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,990
Tradition

621
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,440
has nothing to do with prosperity.

622
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,990
As a Cao descendant,

623
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,670
I must abide by it.

624
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,190
Such a dehumanizing custom

625
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,420
isn't tradition.

626
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,610
Just abandon it.

627
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:14,830
Li Chi.

628
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,600
As a judicial adjutant,

629
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,550
can you bear to watch

630
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,750
your father-in-law

631
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,150
choose the path of death

632
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,590
on his 60th birthday?

633
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,790
I've opposed it before.

634
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,470
But the Family Supervisory Committee

635
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,230
rejected it.

636
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,070
Supervisory Committee?

637
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,470
They're the

638
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,630
Cao family members

639
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,960
who supervise the 60th birthday funeral.

640
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,270
Governor Zhang.

641
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:35,930
Sheriff Lu.

642
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,550
This is an internal affair

643
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,830
of the Cao family.

644
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,360
It has nothing to do with the governor.

645
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,070
Besides, I've made up my mind.

646
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,910
I won't betray my ancestors.

647
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,350
I believe in Buddhism.

648
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,220
After entering the cave,

649
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,720
I won't eat or drink,

650
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,230
chanting sutras

651
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,000
and renouncing the world.

652
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,730
Think about it.

653
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,790
Isn't this a way

654
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,790
to be emancipated

655
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,190
from death?

656
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,290
Others don’t know of such joy.

657
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,360
All this talk about

658
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,550
the 60th birthday funeral has ruined the mood.

659
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,670
Time flies.

660
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,550
How fleeting.

661
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,310
As stated in the Orchid Pavilion Preface,

662
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,990
The things you liked in the past

663
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,250
have become old relics

664
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,870
in a blink of an eye.

665
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,750
As the old saying goes,

666
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,390
death is a big deal after all.

667
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,930
Of course it's sad.

668
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,150
But the joy still remains.

669
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,030
Just like tonight,

670
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,550
I have many friends here,

671
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,500
with the bright moon is in the sky.

672
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,910
Such is my life;

673
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,030
what else can I ask for?

674
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:43,610
Come on.

675
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,230
Let me propose a toast to all of you.

676
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,300
Mr. Cao.

677
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,050
Since I've met you,

678
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,170
you're my dear friend.

679
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,110
I saw you

680
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,950
giving alms at the door.

681
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,660
You are such a kind person.

682
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,950
After hearing your speech,

683
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,390
I'm deeply impressed.

684
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,400
I already think of you as a dear friend.

685
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,370
I never thought...

686
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,750
this meeting is also a farewell.

687
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,240
Mr. Cao!

688
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,710
Assassin!

689
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,930
Catch the assassin!

690
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,990
He escaped.

691
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,790
Assassin?

692
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,390
An assassin came to Qiande Hall?

693
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,830
I'm so sorry

694
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,220
for startling you.

695
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,910
Fed is drunk.

696
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,430
You brought him

697
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,350
to the main room upstairs.

698
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,830
That main room...

699
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,470
I often

700
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,280
sleep in that room.

701
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,270
Whenever I get drunk in Qiande Hall,

702
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,830
I rest there.

703
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,880
I don't want to

704
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,750
disturb my family and servants by returning late.

705
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,790
In that case,

706
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,910
the assassin was targeting Mr. Cao.

707
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,110
I have never

708
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,790
offended anyone in my life.

709
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,780
Mr. Cao,

710
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,630
you're the richest man in Shazhou

711
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,240
and about to have your 60th birthday funeral.

712
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,070
It must involve

713
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,190
your family inheritance.

714
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,310
You mean it's a family member

715
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,760
who wants to harm me?

716
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,910
It's just a guess.

717
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,550
Maybe the assassin

718
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,030
was coming for us.

719
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,430
This assassin was mediocre,

720
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,610
a far cry from those

721
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,030
targeting you and Lu Lingfeng

722
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,540
before.

723
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,710
That's right.

724
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,430
Not only is he unskilled in martial arts

725
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,670
but also cowardly.

726
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,110
When I woke up,

727
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,950
the curved sword in his hand

728
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,410
almost fell to the ground.

729
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,350
Curved sword?

730
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,370
[Cao's Mansion]

731
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,870
Who is it?

732
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,630
Who is it?

733
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:19,860
Father?

734
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,490
Is Li Chi at home?

735
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,110
Isn't he with you

736
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,110
entertaining guests at Qiande Hall?

737
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,070
He's not home.

738
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,010
Don't lie to me.

739
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,310
Father.

740
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,950
I'm your first child.

741
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,390
Since I was young,

742
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,870
I did everything

743
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,190
you asked me to.

744
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,550
I married the man

745
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,670
you chose.

746
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,030
When did I ever lie to you?

747
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,060
Fine.

748
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,360
Why are you crying?

749
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,600
Alright.

750
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,070
I'll go find him somewhere else.

751
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,080
Father, what's wrong with him?

752
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,830
I-I mean...

753
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,280
did Li Chi

754
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,610
offend you?

755
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,190
I'll know after I find him

756
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,070
and interrogate him.

757
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Get off your camel to leave the city!

758
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,880
[Wangjing Gate]

759
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,270
Cripple.

760
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,200
Who are you calling?

761
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,690
I am calling you.

762
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,000
Minister Li.

763
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:29,800
Get lost!

764
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,760
It's really you.

765
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,590
How was my sleeve arrow

766
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,830
last night?

767
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,670
Fed!

768
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,990
You look like a beggar,

769
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,590
yet you claim to be a miracle doctor.

770
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,950
You disrespected me time and again.

771
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,350
I, Li Chi,

772
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,390
am a strong man.

773
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
After I got drunk,

774
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,949
I felt the urge to kill someone.

775
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,460
Fortunately,

776
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,710
I stopped myself in time.

777
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,590
You're lying!

778
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,449
Yesterday,

779
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,389
I slept in Mr. Cao's room.

780
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,219
You wanted to kill Mr. Cao.

781
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,590
After you saw me in the bed,

782
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,790
you changed your mind,

783
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,389
right?

784
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,760
Are you eyeing

785
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,310
Mr. Cao's inheritance?

786
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,429
You...

787
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,159
Father-in-law.

788
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,850
Don't listen to his nonsense.

789
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,150
Your 60th birthday funeral

790
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,350
was imminent

791
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,070
and I couldn't bear to say goodbye.

792
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,659
I was already depressed.

793
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,260
And this Chicken Fed

794
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,739
kept picking on me.

795
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,570
I was drunk and wanted to

796
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,770
teach him a lesson.

797
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,960
But when I was about to do it,

798
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,760
I suddenly...

799
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,550
became sober.

800
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,120
I regret it so much.

801
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,100
I regret it so much!

802
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,430
Assassinating your father-in-law for the inheritance.

803
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,750
I think Physician Fed

804
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,190
has a point.

805
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,090
If you were really wronged,

806
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,550
you would've been cursing

807
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,150
instead of patiently defending yourself.

808
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,580
What evidence do you have

809
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,070
for your accusation?

810
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,470
Lu Lingfeng.

811
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,140
I heard

812
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,950
you've solved some cases.

813
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,590
Don't tell me

814
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,670
they were all based on speculation?

815
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,230
So what if I'm convicting you

816
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,550
on speculation?

817
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,350
Nonsense!

818
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,990
How can we convict him

819
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,350
without evidence?

820
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,910
I understand and sympathize

821
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
with Minister Li.

822
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,180
If I were him,

823
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,590
a matrilocal husband

824
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,250
who didn't get

825
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,090
a fair share of the inheritance,

826
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,150
I'd be indignant too!

827
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,510
Yes!

828
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,810
Even an outsider

829
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,170
can see this injustice!

830
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,070
Is this still speculation?

831
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,290
The governor

832
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,420
heard your confession.

833
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,070
Father-in-law, I...

834
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,140
It was in a moment of weakness.

835
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,260
Let me ask you one thing.

836
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,990
Does Cao Yin know about your assassination?

837
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,870
Say something.

838
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,850
Father, what's wrong with him?

839
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,820
I mean...

840
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,110
did Li Chi

841
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,270
offend you?

842
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,470
I'll know after I find him

843
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,950
and interrogate him.

844
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,150
Interrogate me?

845
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,510
I'm the judicial adjutant.

846
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,670
In Shazhou,

847
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,070
only I can interrogate others.

848
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,530
How did you hurt your leg?

849
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,000
Stop asking.

850
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,470
What did you do to my father?

851
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,780
Go sleep with the kid.

852
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,800
Li Chi!

853
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,300
Yin!

854
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,070
If you want my blood

855
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,910
splattered all over you,

856
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,110
keep brushing me off.

857
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,890
Yin.

858
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,750
I did all this

859
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,750
for you and Saisai.

860
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Cao Yin is filial.

861
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:00,690
She lied to you

862
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,230
that I wasn't home

863
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,660
because she didn't want me to kill you.

864
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,650
She knows

865
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,570
my curved sword

866
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,270
has killed before.

867
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,560
How could you do such a thing?

868
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,040
How can I live in this world?

869
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,390
Yin.

870
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,860
Don't be rash.

871
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,670
Think about it.

872
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,260
For Saisai,

873
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,290
you can't do anything stupid.

874
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,260
Let me bandage it for you.

875
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,550
Go now.

876
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,470
Go?

877
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,670
Go where?

878
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,640
Leave Shazhou.

879
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,930
You can hide anywhere.

880
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,990
I'm an imperial official.

881
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,390
How can I leave without permission?

882
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,390
So you do know you are an official?

883
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,680
As a judicial adjutant,

884
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,310
do you know how heavy a crime you've committed?

885
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,680
Find a way to get out of the city.

886
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,830
Come back

887
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,590
in a week or so after you've recovered.

888
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,320
By then,

889
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,860
my father would be dead.

890
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,400
Sheriff Lu would

891
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,840
also have left Shazhou.

892
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,220
If anyone asks, tell them

893
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,150
you were depressed tonight,

894
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,510
so you rode out of the city.

895
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,360
But you fell off the cliff, got injured,

896
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,690
and couldn't come back.

897
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,990
Then, no one will hold you accountable.

898
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,870
Brilliant.

899
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,990
Good idea.

900
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,030
My wife loves me the most.

901
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,160
You tried to kill my father.

902
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,320
I really want to make mincemeat of you!

903
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,830
But my father will

904
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,410
have his 60th birthday funeral soon.

905
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,950
If you become a prisoner too,

906
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,190
how will I and Saisai live?

907
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,280
That means

908
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,750
Yin didn't know

909
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,390
about your assassination.

910
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,070
I'm sorry, Father-in-law.

911
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,740
Please let me off.

912
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,880
In the next life,

913
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,190
I'll still be your son-in-law.

914
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,050
And continue to harm me in your next life?

915
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,380
That's not what I meant.

916
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,230
I meant in my next life,

917
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,230
I'll be your son-in-law.

918
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,950
Shut up!

919
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,390
You are no longer my son-in-law.

920
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,120
Governor Zhang.

921
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,880
Punish this villain severely.

922
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,710
Cao Zhongda!

923
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,150
I'm an imperial official.

924
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,550
I didn't kill anyone.

925
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,410
As a merchant,

926
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,190
how dare you ask for me to be punished severely?

927
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,720
As a matrilocal husband,

928
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,360
I even let Saisai take the Cao surname.

929
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,830
Why is the three of us only getting

930
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,150
10% of the inheritance?

931
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,150
10%!

932
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,110
I don't accept it!

933
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,710
Wait.

934
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,640
My will

935
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,200
hasn't been announced yet.

936
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,250
How do you know the content?

937
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,670
It's Ding Mao, right?

938
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,660
Your butler isn't loyal to you.

939
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,550
To think you even made him

940
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,460
the provider of Cao Family Cave.

941
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,350
It took only five silver ingots.

942
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,070
Master!

943
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,470
Ding Mao.

944
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,870
Master.

945
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,670
Just in time.

946
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,510
I trust you so much,

947
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,950
but you are Li Chi's accomplice.

948
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,470
Do you want to kill me

949
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,910
so that you can edit the will

950
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,360
to get my inheritance?

951
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,070
No!

952
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,270
I was just momentarily greedy.

953
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,270
So I took his money

954
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,010
and told him the content of the will.

955
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,070
But I didn't expect

956
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,870
a judicial adjutant like him

957
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,510
to try to kill you!

958
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,880
I left the will with you,

959
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,540
but you read it secretly.

960
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,510
That's a serious crime.

961
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,470
I'm guilty.

962
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:51,730
But Master,

963
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,010
I'm here to tell you

964
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,850
the servants at home reported

965
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,390
that Young Master...

966
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,990
He's dead.

967
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,040
What nonsense is that?

968
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,100
It's true.

969
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,790
Young Master...

970
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,790
He was murdered!

971
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,060
Mr. Cao.

972
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,260
Duobao.
