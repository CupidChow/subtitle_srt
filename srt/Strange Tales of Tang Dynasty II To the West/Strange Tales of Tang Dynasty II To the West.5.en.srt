[Episode 5]

4
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,390
I'm thirsty.

5
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,390
May I have a drink?

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,270
Pour it yourself.

7
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,580
The wall is not a wall.

8
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,520
What do you mean?

9
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,950
Here's the thing.

10
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,350
I saw a few words somewhere

11
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,460
in the temple today.

12
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,570
"The monks are not monks."

13
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,120
"The wall is not a wall."

14
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,030
I understood the first

15
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,590
line.

16
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,430
But I couldn't figure out

17
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,900
what

18
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,170
the second line means.

19
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,130
So I came to ask you, Mr. Qin.

20
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,910
The wall in front of us

21
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,200
is not an ordinary wall.

22
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,190
It will be remembered forever.

23
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,710
So,

24
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,900
you already have a plan for the finishing touch?

25
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,120
The plan has always been in my heart.

26
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,890
If it's always in your heart,

27
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,220
why don't you just do it?

28
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,230
Her Highness and the rest...

29
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,990
I need peace!

30
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,120
It's too noisy

31
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,030
and my heart is restless.

32
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,200
Su Wuming said

33
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,250
he was very honored today.

34
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,829
What did he mean by that?

35
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,660
Ordinary people seldom get to

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,600
listen in on

37
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,870
a heartfelt conversation

38
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,530
between two Danqing masters.

39
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,150
He said that.

40
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,880
Well, what do you think?

41
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,610
I think you and Qin Xiaobai

42
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,130
had more things to talk about.

43
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,510
Are you jealous?

44
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,920
I'm happy.

45
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,360
In the face of Cen Zhi's threat,

46
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,079
you fearlessly despised him.

47
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,630
In the face of the Danqing master's difficulties,

48
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,600
you were empathetic and respectful.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,200
Pei Xijun,

50
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,840
you're exemplary among women.

51
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,730
This is the first time you've praised me.

52
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,270
You praised me so grandly.

53
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,790
Pei Jian is cunning.

54
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,830
But his daughter is beautiful and intelligent.

55
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,110
No wonder Lu Lingfeng likes her.

56
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,510
But she disobeyed the order.

57
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,480
If this gets out,

58
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,650
your prestige will be ruined.

59
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,270
It's not that serious.

60
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,490
Painting,

61
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,620
sword-wielding,

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,640
poem writing,

63
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,270
and music.

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,310
Everyone who makes great achievements

65
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,510
has something special about them.

66
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,830
Since Pei Xijun said

67
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,750
we should trust Qin Xiaobai,

68
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,810
let's give them some time.

69
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,350
The Minister of Rites,

70
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,910
Xu Zhiyun, is here.

71
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,520
The one the Crown Prince promoted?

72
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,310
A mere minister of rites asking for your audience?

73
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,140
How absurd.

74
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,670
I'll shoo him off.

75
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,930
Haven't you been doing those things

76
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,390
to scare off people who pander to

77
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,390
the Crown Prince?

78
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,840
There's no harm in meeting him.

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,270
Raise your head.

80
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,500
This is my first time seeing you

81
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,770
at such a close distance, Your Highness.

82
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,630
Why are you shivering?

83
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,990
Do I look scary?

84
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,270
No, no.

85
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,030
Your Highness,

86
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,950
your beauty is stunning.

87
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,470
I've been well-educated since I was a child

88
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,070
and dedicated myself to studies for a decade.

89
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,670
And yet,

90
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,430
I couldn't think of the right words

91
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,830
to compliment your beauty,

92
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,870
Your Highness.

93
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,830
All right.

94
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,430
Go back to sleep.

95
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,180
You can only crack the mystery if you have a good rest.

[Mortuary Room]

97
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,430
Be careful!

98
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,990
Report!

99
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,930
Mr. Lu.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,700
We have never stopped patrolling

101
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,630
in the rain.

102
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,350
We didn't encounter the Mara.

103
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,190
Report!

104
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,070
Mr. Lu.

105
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,270
Nothing unusual at the east gate.

106
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,190
No sign of the Mara either.

107
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,909
Report!

108
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:55,680
Sir,

109
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,830
nothing unusual was found at the north gate.

110
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,290
No sigh of the Mara either.

111
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,830
I've been informed.

112
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,290
That vile man sure is bold.

113
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,990
How dare he come to assassinate someone at the Supreme Court?

114
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,910
He's not a vile man.

115
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,750
He's the Mara.

116
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,420
What?

117
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,870
He didn't come in either,

118
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,150
and he never went out.

119
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,190
He should still be in the Supreme Court.

120
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,990
Search for him!

121
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,480
Yes.

122
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,390
How did it go?

123
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,600
Looks like he's still at large.

124
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,950
-This Mara...
-This Mara...

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,590
You first.

126
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,590
I want you to go first.

127
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,790
This Mara is not the same.

128
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,030
What were you going to say?

129
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,150
I wanted to say

130
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,320
the same thing as Xijun.

131
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,770
When I was at the Ghost Market,

132
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,330
I fought that Mara before.

133
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,860
The Mara this time

134
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,950
isn't as skilled in martial arts.

135
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,810
And his face...

136
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,260
Is different.

137
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,810
Although the charcoal seller stood far away,

138
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,510
he got a clear look

139
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,170
of the Mara's facial outline.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,660
The Mara this time wore a mask.

141
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,310
He looked more like the one

142
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,190
on the wall of Chengfo Temple.

143
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,990
That's right.

144
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,800
State your purpose.

145
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,720
My master, the Minster of Rites, is bored.

146
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,450
So he summoned two courtesans.

147
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,510
I know that

148
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,670
the courtesans outside cannot compare

149
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,270
to the ones from Cloud Tower.

150
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,960
As the new favorite talent

151
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,430
of the Princess' Palace,

152
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,000
I can only make do for now.

153
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,160
The Minister of Rites meant to say that

154
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,430
it's your blessing to be able

155
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,190
to serve him.

156
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,650
You brought Pipas with you.

157
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,560
What song can you play?

158
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,310
Hurry up.

159
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,870
Looks like

160
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,670
you're satisfied.

161
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
You're done here.

162
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,770
Get out.

163
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,000
Beauty.

164
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,190
Beauty.

165
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,620
Sister.

166
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,790
Don't go.

167
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,190
Sister?

168
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,550
You should call her granny.

169
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,590
Beauty.

170
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,730
Come here!

171
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,260
Sister.

172
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,860
Show him your real appearance.

173
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
Don't let him look down on you.

174
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,310
Okay.

175
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,090
Why do I feel that

176
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,220
you look familiar?

177
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:19,990
Have we met

178
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,570
at Cloud Tower before?

179
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,640
I've never been to Cloud Tower.

180
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,400
But I might have been on the wall

181
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,750
of Chengfo Temple.

182
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,520
Chengfo Temple?

183
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,830
The three witches!

184
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,830
He was strangled with a Pipa string,

185
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,440
resulting in suffocation.

186
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,480
They took his liver before he died.

187
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,830
Tell me.

188
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,910
Where did you hire the courtesans?

189
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,750
It was so late

190
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,330
and it was raining.

191
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,890
Where else can I find courtesans?

192
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,870
You went to the Ghost Market?

193
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,270
Did you see

194
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,070
the three women's appearances?

195
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,470
No.

196
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,000
No...

197
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,750
We've got the raw materials.

198
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,280
Please have a look, My Lord.

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,780
Perfect timing.

200
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,740
Put it into the pot immediately

201
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,030
to turn it into treasure.

202
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,960
We can't delay the finishing touch of Mara's Defeat.

203
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:19,820
♫The memories seem like yesterday♫

204
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,310
♫Suddenly they turn into emptiness♫

205
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,390
♫How many years can one have in life♫

206
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:40,570
♫Each year is always uneasy♫

207
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,190
Many officials died mysteriously.

208
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,550
The mysterious case has not been solved yet.

209
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,310
Now Xu Zhiyun

210
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,730
died in his own house.

211
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,960
Is this still the capital of Tang?

212
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,190
Calm down, Your Highness.

213
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,990
In my opinion,

214
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,850
Xu Zhiyun deserved to die.

215
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,190
You may not know.

216
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,950
Since he came to the capital,

217
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,510
he was arrogant and indulged in lustful activities

218
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,870
just because he was rich.

219
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,350
After being promoted by you,

220
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,990
his lavish and sinful lifestyle became worse.

221
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,550
Now,

222
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,830
realizing Her Highness' power,

223
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,270
he pandered shamelessly to her.

224
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,070
I heard

225
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,990
he bribed Chancellor Cui with a big fortune

226
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,470
and got the chance to meet her.

227
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,230
He was officially working for her before he died.

228
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,630
It didn't matter who he worked for

229
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,290
as long as he served the court.

230
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,990
But he died in his own house

231
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,320
under the protection of

232
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,200
the Supreme Court.

233
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,590
In the future, no one in Chang'an

234
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,430
will feel safe anymore.

235
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,740
Xu Zhiyun is dead?

236
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,470
I just heard about it too.

237
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,700
I wanted to report it tomorrow.

238
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,020
Your men didn't do it?

239
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,230
Of course not.

240
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,510
How did Chang'an

241
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,070
suddenly become like this?

242
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,490
It's been a bit chaotic lately.

243
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,300
But I think

244
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,140
Xu Zhiyun's death

245
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,390
is a coincidence.

246
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,840
It also benefits us.

247
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,640
Tell me about it.

248
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,710
Today,

249
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,010
Xu Zhiyun abandoned the Eastern Palace

250
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,310
and pledged loyalty to you.

251
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,140
Then, he was mysteriously killed.

252
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,740
Tomorrow,

253
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,260
everyone in court will wonder

254
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,390
who the murderer is.

255
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,270
You can then invite the Crown Prince

256
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,650
to the Mara's Defeat's consecration ceremony.

257
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,480
In order to clear his suspicion,

258
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,710
he can only accept the invitation.

259
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,430
The problem is,

260
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,790
can we still

261
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,270
control those people?

262
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,630
Please rest assured.

263
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,550
It's all under control.

264
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,600
They

265
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,310
are willing to serve you.

266
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,210
They're waiting to prove themselves at the Mingyin Festival.

267
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,540
The death of Xu Zhiyun

268
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,980
[Supreme Court]

269
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,210
proved your guess.

270
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,960
That stormy night,

271
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Mara originally wanted to kill him.

272
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,590
But Sun Wang was promoted by the princess.

273
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,630
His cause of death

274
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,790
is still a mystery.

275
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,350
Didn't you have doubts?

276
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,470
Otherwise,

277
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,830
why did you go to General Ma's mansion to investigate?

278
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,500
Sun Wang stood out

279
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,980
from the other two victims

280
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,030
because he died from a Mo sword.

281
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,870
The general of the Anxi Army,

282
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,170
Ma Xiong, happens to wield a Mo sword

283
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,150
You must have seen the Akhal-Teke horse

284
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,350
of Ma's Mansion too.

285
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,910
Before a calvary night raid,

286
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,290
to hide their whereabouts,

287
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,630
it's of utmost importance for

288
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,750
people to hide their faces and horses to wrap their hooves.

289
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,630
Specifically for horses,

290
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,750
apart from wrapping their hooves,

291
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,380
the horses must also be muzzled and their tails tied.

292
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,590
That horse's tail

293
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,030
was tied.

294
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,390
A warhorse's tied tail

295
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,670
can be long or short.

296
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,480
For short, they tie the tail into an upward knot.

297
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,110
For long, they braid the tail up.

298
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,240
When one acts alone,

299
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,990
the horse's tail is usually braided,

300
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,190
just like that horse.

301
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,340
You suspect that

302
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,280
someone has been riding that horse recently?

303
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,790
Yes.

304
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,920
But that horse is very fierce.

305
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,030
The one most likely to ride it

306
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,780
is its owner.

307
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,110
There were no orders from the court,

308
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,830
nor any impeachment from the border patrol procurators.

309
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,230
So, Ma Xiong should be stationed with his unit

310
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,220
in the city of Aksu in the Western Region.

311
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,620
Therefore, I had to leave

312
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,960
this clue aside.

313
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,040
There's another question.

314
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,430
Ma's Mansion is massive,

315
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,830
but there isn't a single maid around.

316
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,630
There are dozens of horses without a horse keeper.

317
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,270
Do you know it wasn't like this before?

318
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,580
One year ago, Mrs. Ma

319
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,430
dismissed the maids and servants.

320
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,630
Sun Wang also started frequenting the mansion

321
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,430
to treat the horses one year ago.

322
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,740
Please make the trip.

323
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,440
Ridiculous.

324
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,670
His Majesty has sent an order.

325
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,380
I'm not allowed to interfere in this matter.

326
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,260
If you want to go,

327
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,119
go by yourself.

328
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,190
I can't.

329
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,710
I don't have your nobleness

330
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,300
of the Lu family of Fanyang,

331
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,470
neither am I as valiant as you.

332
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,109
Su Wuming.

333
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,960
You've gone too far.

334
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,810
This matter

335
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,060
will be a secret between us.

336
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,350
I will never let Xijun know.

337
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm still not going.

338
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,030
Who do you think I am?

339
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,550
Junior!

340
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,020
The key to solving the mysterious case

341
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,090
is in Ma's Mansion!

342
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,160
Please go there.

343
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,710
As your senior,

344
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,510
I thank you in advance.

345
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,230
[Ma's Mansion]

346
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,360
Who's there?

347
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,710
How dare you, thief?

348
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,470
Get lost!

349
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,310
My husband is the great general.

350
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,240
When he returns,

351
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,830
you will be killed for sure.

352
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,830
I've checked.

353
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,920
General Ma has been on the border

354
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,850
for three years.

355
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,970
Madam, you're beautiful,

356
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,600
but you are left here alone.

357
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,990
What a pity.

358
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,270
Who are you?

359
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
Your voice sounds familiar.

360
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,270
Lu Lingfeng from the Supreme Court.

361
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,670
Mr. Lu.

362
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,990
It's late.

363
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,560
My doors are all closed.

364
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,290
Did you climb over the wall

365
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,470
to investigate the case?

366
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,430
Of course not.

367
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,970
It's a long night and I can't sleep alone.

368
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,690
I suddenly thought of you.

369
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,730
I happen to have a jar of good wine.

370
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,110
Let's drink together.

371
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,150
Mr. Lu.

372
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,640
Let me pour you some wine.

373
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,270
You are drunk.

374
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,430
Are you not drunk?

375
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Not from the wine,

376
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,990
but on you.

377
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,190
You're such a sweet-talker.

378
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,980
I'll get

379
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,470
even more drunk soon.

380
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,990
What's wrong?

381
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
You don't like me?

382
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,930
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

383
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,830
I just prefer Black Balm more.

384
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,270
A few days ago, at the Prime Minister's night banquet,

385
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,200
I saw some ladies using Black Balm.

386
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,590
The color

387
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,730
must match you so well.

388
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,430
Black Balm?

389
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,300
I have the best kind.

390
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,510
Wait for me.

391
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,430
Lu,

392
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,200
does my Black Balm smell good?

393
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,880
It's not just fragrant,

394
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,350
but also sweet.

395
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,150
Lu, try it.

396
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,120
It's really you!

397
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,140
Confess your affair with Sun Wang

398
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,010
right now.

399
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:23,910
You...

400
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,750
Lu Lingfeng.

401
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,960
The Black Balm isn't enough reason

402
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,950
for you to arrest me.

403
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,540
If you won't let me go,

404
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,150
just kill me.

405
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,850
When my husband Ma Xiong

406
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,250
returns from the border,

407
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,410
he'll sue you in front of His Majesty!

408
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,780
I'm not Lu Lingfeng.

409
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm here

410
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,790
to serve you.

411
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,150
Come with me.

412
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,150
There is

413
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,950
nothing here.

414
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,590
What is this place?

415
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,310
This is where I serve people.

416
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,470
This is called Ground Howler.

417
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,640
You don't like it?

418
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,190
There's more here.

419
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,920
This is called

420
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,830
Death Prayer.

421
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,110
This is...

422
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,960
Breath Taker.

423
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,390
This is Pulse Stopper.

424
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,200
This is Upside-down.

425
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,110
This is Right-side-up.

426
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,710
This is the Backward Curve.

427
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,030
There are also Limb Stretcher,

428
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,740
Organ Picker,

429
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,430
and Spine Carver...

430
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,880
This cauldron has been on the fire for 4 hours.

431
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,870
When its bottom turns red,

432
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,430
I will help you get inside.

433
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,780
I heard that you're here to treat the horses, Dr. Sun.

434
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,180
Thank you.

435
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,910
Sun Wang climbed over the wall that night.

436
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,510
He was drunk

437
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,630
and unreserved.

438
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,130
I was afraid people would hear us.

439
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,310
The next day, I fired all the

440
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,440
maids and servants.

441
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,910
After that, he was even bolder.

442
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,160
He even came to me in the day

443
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,090
in the name of treating the horses.

444
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,110
Where did you get the Black Balm?

445
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,830
It was a strange occurrence.

446
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,670
It smells so good.

447
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,930
Let me have a taste.

448
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,070
You're so thoughtful.

449
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,400
This Black Balm must be expensive.

450
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,910
Quit pretending.

451
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,250
Come on.

452
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,350
Tell me.

453
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,830
Did you buy it from the East Market

454
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,020
or the West Market?

455
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,240
I didn't buy it.

456
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,700
Such a fragrant Black Balm.

457
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,210
I've never seen something like this in Chang'an markets.

458
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,220
After a rainy night,

459
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,750
it remained fragrant for days.

460
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,340
There must be extremely precious

461
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,870
spices in the Black Balm.

462
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,860
Could it be...

463
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,750
Yuelin fragrance?

464
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,370
Yuelin fragrance?

465
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,310
Could it be from

466
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,270
the nation in the extreme West,

467
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,940
Byzantine?

468
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,770
That's right.

469
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,990
Su Wuming.

470
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,240
You're indeed knowledgeable.

471
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,500
I thought this thing

472
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,570
only existed in legends.

473
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,580
No.

474
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,030
This material can be added to

475
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,150
women's cosmetic products,

476
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,510
but it also has medicinal use.

477
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,270
It's just extremely precious.

478
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,070
Even in the markets of Chang'an

479
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,390
and Luoyang,

480
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,580
it's a rare find.

481
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,110
I think that

482
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,510
a Black Balm made from

483
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,060
such a precious ingredient

484
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,150
can only come from the Western Region.

485
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,950
You said that Ma Xiong hasn't been back

486
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,280
to Chang'an for three years, is that true?

487
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,190
Well...

488
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,070
Tell me the truth.

489
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,410
Otherwise, I will tell Elder Zhou

490
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,370
to come back.

491
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,670
He has never been home.

492
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,120
But I saw that Akhal-Teke horse

493
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,960
leap out of the yard once.

494
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,430
When it came back,

495
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,990
its tail was braided.

496
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,710
The only one who can ride that horse

497
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,230
is Ma Xiong.

498
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,470
Let's talk about the night of

499
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,070
Sun Wang's murder.

500
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,310
The more detailed, the better.

501
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,310
Who is it?

502
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,550
I'm here

503
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,390
to play the qin.

504
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,870
I don't have a qin here.

505
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,700
You are the qin yourself.

506
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,700
You're the Chief Musician's favorite.

507
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,750
That wasn't the first time the horse

508
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,680
went out in the middle of the night.

509
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,420
Although I had doubts,

510
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,540
I didn't think much of it.

511
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,950
I'm sorry

512
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
for waking you up.

513
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,790
It's a good thing.

514
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,090
I wanted to go another round with you.

515
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,810
Go put on the Black Balm.

516
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,590
I haven't smelled

517
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,470
its alluring fragrance for days.

518
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,080
I long for it.

519
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,990
Later I heard that Sun Wang

520
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,320
was killed by a Mo sword.

521
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,970
So I suspected that

522
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,480
he really came back.

523
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,090
But since he didn't come home,

524
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,470
I'm sure he doesn't want me anymore.

525
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,000
So I started hoping that

526
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,950
another man would come to me.

527
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,320
I'll spite him to death.

528
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,750
Mrs. Ma

529
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,270
finally told us everything.

530
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,950
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Lu.

531
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,630
Su Wuming.

532
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,030
You owe me this time.

533
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,670
Sooner or later,

534
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,620
I'll make you do this too.

535
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,740
Do what?

536
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,180
Did you and Mrs. Ma

537
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,990
really...

538
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,470
You...

539
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,530
Come in.

540
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,070
It's so late.

541
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,070
Are you still discussing the case?

542
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,310
I cooked two bowls

543
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,270
of wontons for you.

544
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,400
Thank you.

545
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,390
You made it yourself?

546
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,460
We have to try it.

547
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,110
Let's eat together.

548
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,830
No, thanks.

549
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,930
Please enjoy.

550
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,270
Rest early.

551
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,230
You two

552
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,520
are the backbone of the Supreme Court.

553
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,200
Don't tire yourselves out.

554
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,150
Thank you.

555
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,330
The wontons smell so good.

556
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,270
Those wontons were so good.

557
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,750
I'm full.

558
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,270
Me too.

559
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,510
Why do I feel so dizzy?

560
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,590
Mr. Lu,

561
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,710
help me.

562
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,690
Why do I feel

563
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,590
like my energy's drained?

564
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,020
We fell into the villain's trap!

565
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,310
I can't move...

566
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,230
Hey,

567
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,680
did you drug them

568
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,910
with the slow-acting drag,

569
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,020
Quelingxiao?

570
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,120
I don't know about other drugs,

571
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,290
but I know Quelingxiao very well.

572
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,950
People won't die immediately after eating it.

573
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,410
But it will hurt their eyes

574
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,440
and numb their hearts

575
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,190
and pulses.

576
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,810
In less than two hours,

577
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,630
they will become disabled.

578
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,430
You're no match for Lu Lingfeng,

579
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,030
so you decided to drug him,

580
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,310
am I right?

581
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,550
Tell me.

582
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,010
how much are their heads

583
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,170
worth in gold?

584
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:41,920
Mr. Lu,

585
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,290
your spear is here.

586
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:43,850
No need.

587
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,870
The Mara is not a strong foe.

588
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,110
Fellow members of the Supreme Court,

589
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,430
step forward if you want to capture the Mara and be rewarded.

590
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,030
Yes!

591
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,590
How dare you, Zhang Qian.

592
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,520
Remove his mask!

593
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,190
That's strange.

594
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,950
What is?

595
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,720
Brother,

596
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,990
I think

597
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,910
this person drew the tortoise.

598
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,640
But the snake

599
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,310
was drawn by this person.

600
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,950
Chen Shi?

601
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,030
Chang Fang?

602
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,610
Zhang Qian!

603
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,200
How did Dr. Li's file move

604
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,160
from the South Dorm to the North Pavilion?

605
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,230
Did you conceal the truth

606
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,230
to stop Mr. Lu from solving the case?

607
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,950
Director Chang and I

608
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,110
dared not bend the law

609
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,990
and disregard human lives.

610
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,070
Although we don't get along,

611
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,330
we are on the same path.

612
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,160
These two cases

613
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,230
were related to the Royal Temple.

614
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,230
Chang'an County and the Yongzhou Government

615
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,080
dared not interfere.

616
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,950
It's deeply regrettable.

617
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,170
No one in the Supreme Court

618
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,470
dared to rise to the task too.

619
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,670
Only when Mr. Lu came,

620
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,710
did we see a glimmer of hope.

621
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,840
But we couldn't find

622
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,570
the file in the South Dorm anymore.

623
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,070
We drew the Black Tortoise together

624
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,070
to test the water.

625
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,260
We didn't expect that Mr. Lu would

626
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,260
find the file in the North Pavilion.

627
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:39,980
The North Pavilion key

628
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,350
is in your hands, Zhang Qian.

629
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,150
Do you still want to deny it?

630
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,670
Speak!

631
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,110
Just kill me!

632
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,390
Cut the crap!

633
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,030
Secretary Zhang.

634
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,620
Old friend.

635
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,969
Thank you for taking care of me for the past years.

636
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,750
Today is the time to repay you.

637
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,370
I still remember how they treated

638
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,949
Liu Jingxian, Li Zhaode,

639
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,440
and black-teeth Chang Zhi

640
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,659
back then.

641
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,670
Although you are only an eighth-rank official,

642
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,590
I will treat you like

643
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,310
you're a Prime Minister

644
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,739
or a Great General.

645
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,420
Su Wuming, Lu Lingfeng!

646
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:37,989
You can't

647
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,790
use these torture methods on me!

648
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,739
The court abolished them long ago!

649
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,190
Elder Zhou has long retired.

650
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,020
What he does

651
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,320
has nothing to do with us.

652
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,750
I confess!

653
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,070
I'll confess, okay?

654
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,710
Zhou Lao!

655
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,880
It's him.

656
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,830
I'm here today

657
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,370
because of him!

658
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,790
Zhang Qian.

659
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,190
I've worked here half my life.

660
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,030
This is my first time seeing someone

661
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,950
slander others out of desperation

662
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,620
like you.

663
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,370
Zhou Lao is my accomplice!

664
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,530
Otherwise,

665
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,190
how could I have hidden the file

666
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,450
in the North Pavilion?

667
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,070
I remember now.

668
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,190
An old friend from Shendu

669
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,040
came to see me.

670
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,310
Because Zhang Qian had the North Pavilion key,

671
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,440
I recommended them to each other.

672
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,170
His name is Xiao Wenzhen.

673
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,830
He works in the Palace Chamber Bureau.

674
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,550
Xiao Wenzhen

675
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,790
was introduced to me by Zhou Lao.

676
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,190
He is not a high official,

677
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,030
but he serves His Majesty.

678
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,730
He said working for him

679
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,750
is like working for His Majesty.

680
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,490
After that,

681
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,190
he gave me an order

682
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,770
in the form of letters.

683
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,220
He told me to suppress Dr. Li's case

684
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,840
and the Chengfo Temple fighting case.

685
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,650
I've been a secretary for many years.

686
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,910
I know that

687
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,990
intentionally destroying files

688
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,310
is a capital offence.

689
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,020
So I hid it in the North Pavilion.

690
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,100
Two days ago...

691
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,330
He ordered me to disguise as the Mara

692
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,590
and kill the two of you.

693
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,430
He promised to promote me

694
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,390
by three levels after that

695
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
and make me the capital magistrate.

696
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,770
Where is the letter he gave you?

697
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,790
Well...

698
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,790
Magic?

699
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:52,620
[Supreme Court]

700
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,400
Chengfo Temple will be unveiled tomorrow.

701
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,230
We only have one day left.

702
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,270
Although we arrested Zhang Qian,

703
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,270
he is not the Mara who killed people.

704
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,000
What's scarier is

705
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,950
the thousands of Mara Army

706
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,740
in the dark.

707
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,790
[Yongzhou Government]

708
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,430
Su Wuming, how could you?

709
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,580
You forgot your old friend after you got promoted.

710
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,480
[Administrator of Yongzhou, Du Ming]

711
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,730
You visit my Yongzhou Government after so long?

712
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,150
It's just a temporary role.

713
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,750
Mr. Du, please arrange

714
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,790
for a meeting with His Majesty for me immediately.

715
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,150
What?

716
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,790
I know you can do it.

717
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,590
As the Administrator of Yongzhou,

718
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,980
you work neither for the Princess

719
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,320
nor the Crown Prince.

720
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,610
Therefore, you must be

721
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,110
trusted by His Majesty.

722
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,110
Go.

723
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,590
Greetings, Your Majesty.

724
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,590
Why can't you report to me

725
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,320
during court session instead?

726
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,670
What I'm about to say today

727
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,150
cannot be said in court.

728
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,910
Xiao Wenzhen?

729
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,950
There is someone with that name.

730
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,790
I have executed him

731
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,590
after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

732
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,990
Was his crime

733
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,490
related to the Sky-scraping Tower case?

734
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,070
I

735
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,360
don't want to talk about it.

736
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,790
Your Majesty.

737
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,470
Before the Mid-Autumn Festival,

738
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,040
the Palace Chamber Bureau

739
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,140
was handled by Chamberlain Feng, right?

740
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,270
The mastermind who worked with Sass

741
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,030
to assassinate Her Highness

742
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,710
and His Highness at the Sky-scraping Tower

743
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,070
must be Chamberlain Feng Han, right?

744
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,390
Feng Han?

745
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,270
I've killed him!

746
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,430
Su Wuming.

747
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,350
I ordered you back to the capital

748
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,230
to investigate

749
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,470
the case of Mara's murders.

750
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,760
Why do you insist on discussing

751
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,740
the Sky-scraping Tower case?

752
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,070
What do you want?

753
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,950
That day,

754
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,330
I already cast my safety aside

755
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,710
when I stopped you, Your Majesty.

756
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,750
Therefore, I must

757
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,270
clarify something with you today.

758
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,830
Even if you wish to kill me out of anger,

759
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,490
please wait

760
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,710
until I solve this case.

761
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,510
You...

762
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,770
[Supreme Court]

763
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,150
Su Wuming.

764
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,990
I'm afraid you're right.

765
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,520
This thing

766
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,010
is not just made of Azurite

767
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,120
and Silverfish.

768
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,190
The third key ingredient

769
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,270
should be the liver of an animal.

770
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,560
No, not an animal's.

771
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,320
What are you talking about?

772
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,320
Using the liver as medicine

773
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,110
can indeed treat the eyes.

774
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,280
But the so-called Flying Light

775
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,710
is a paint made from human liver

776
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,830
to draw the finishing touch.

777
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,090
It's said to be able to draw the brightest eyes.

778
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,030
This is such an evil method.

779
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,630
It's definitely evil.

780
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,300
It's even worse than my senior,

781
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,100
Meng Donglao.

782
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,070
So evil!

783
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,510
Tomorrow is the Mingyin Festival.

784
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,070
Tonight will be the last deal

785
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,880
for the Flying Light.

786
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,630
Zu.

787
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,070
What took you so long?

788
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,040
It's raining outside.

789
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,630
Did you slip?

790
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,670
No, Senior.

791
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,880
Why did you buy

792
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,640
such a small jar of wine?

793
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,570
Do you want to drink it?

794
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,550
Take a cup if you want.

795
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,310
Today,

796
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,110
we'll get drunk together.

797
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,270
Senior,

798
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,030
stop drinking.

799
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,070
Tomorrow is the Mingyin Festival.

800
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:47,530
Well...

801
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,630
It's fine if you won't drink with me.

802
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,870
Why are you crying?

803
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,800
It's a small jar, but it's good wine.

804
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,930
If I'm right,

805
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,560
you've found the Flying Light, right?

806
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:16,830
Senior,

807
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,890
have you finally decided to use it?

808
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:19,710
Sure.

809
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,470
Although we haven't gotten it yet,

810
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,100
tonight,

811
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,920
I can acquire it for sure.

812
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,670
I couldn't do the finishing touch.

813
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,800
But you're the one who's worried sick.

814
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,430
That thing is prohibited.

815
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,180
Aren't you afraid that by buying the Flying Light...

816
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,310
Even if I have to die,

817
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,500
I don't want you to

818
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,950
lose your life because you can't

819
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,140
complete the finishing touch.

820
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,590
I have a bad temper.

821
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,470
But you never left me.

822
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,150
It must have been hard for you.
