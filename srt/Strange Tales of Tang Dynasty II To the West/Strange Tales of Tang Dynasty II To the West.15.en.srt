[Episode 15]

4
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,350
I'll say.

5
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,310
I'll say.

6
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,680
After the snow stopped,

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,880
I went to the latrine.

8
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,350
When I came out...

9
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,660
I saw that Mi Tuo

10
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,940
didn't have his backpack on him.

11
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,350
And I remembered he said...

12
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,680
Put down your backpack.

13
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,060
No one would steal it.

14
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,480
That won't do.

15
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,470
The contents in this backpack

16
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,460
are worth more than what you would earn for ten years

17
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,590
after you become an Imperial Scholar.

18
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,030
After stealing the backpack,

19
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,270
I hid by the back door

20
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,870
and sneaked back into the room

21
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,940
while everyone was out.

22
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,230
I really didn't kill anyone.

23
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,320
I'm just a scholar

24
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,630
I'm as weak as a chicken.

25
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,860
You think being named Juzi

26
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,950
makes you a scholar?

27
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,750
I think you're just a scoundrel.

28
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,550
Tell me,

29
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,760
where did you hide the murder weapon?

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,750
I didn't kill anyone

31
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,480
I don't have any murder weapon!

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,560
Aren't you afraid I'll use torture?

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,670
I really didn't kill anyone.

34
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,920
Don't use torture!

35
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,800
In this remote inn,

36
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,510
there are indeed no torture devices.

37
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,710
We can only beat you.

38
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,190
If he continues not to confess,

39
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,470
beat him to death with sticks!

40
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:21,829
Yes!

41
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,930
Wait!

42
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,670
Wait!

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,560
Swordsman,

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,910
Hermit,

45
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,430
and you, Lu,

46
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,230
you all don't

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,760
seem like ordinary people.

48
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,070
You can't just stand by

49
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,960
and watch this outsider sheriff

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,250
show no regard for human life!

51
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,100
Gag him!

52
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:36,750
Yes!

53
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,230
Don't move!

54
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,740
The case is solved.

55
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,750
I will rush to Shen County overnight.

56
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,829
Tomorrow morning, I'll hand over

57
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,070
the murderer, Lan Juzi, and the stolen goods

58
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,150
to the sheriff of Shen County.

59
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,030
This way,

60
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,950
tonight

61
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,500
have a good sleep tonight.

62
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,230
It's all thanks to

63
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,230
Sheriff Long.

64
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,230
Hermit Jiang is right.

65
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,910
Sheriff Long,

66
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,350
I, Lu

67
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,250
admire you deeply.

68
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,579
Sheriff Long,

69
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,590
with your sense of justice,

70
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,550
concern for the people,

71
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,630
effective case investigation abilities,

72
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,150
and insightful judgments,

73
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,470
once you take office in the capital,

74
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,710
you will surely make significant contributions.

75
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,340
Although

76
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,260
Wannian County has only you as its sheriff,

77
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,730
I believe

78
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,150
you will assist the magistrate

79
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,190
in efficiently governing

80
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,270
the area east of Zhuque Avenue.

81
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,630
Of course.

82
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,140
As soon as I arrive in the capital

83
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,520
I will sweep away all the thieves and robbers

84
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,720
from Wannian County.

85
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,030
Everyone,

86
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,870
farewell.

87
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,030
Take the felon with us.

88
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,560
Let's go.

89
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,440
You bandits, stop!

90
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,550
Who is it?

91
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,830
Who shouted that?

92
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,530
It was me.

93
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,730
What are you gonna do about it?

94
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,450
Where are the bandits?

95
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,550
Right in front of you.

96
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,190
Who?

97
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,000
The one impersonating the sheriff is the bandit.

98
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:46,880
Sheriff,

99
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,100
I think all these people are bandits!

100
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,550
Just give the order,

101
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,880
and we'll kill them all!

102
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,810
You think putting on that uniform

103
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,740
makes you a constable of the government office?

104
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,550
Are you going to surrender now,

105
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,420
or do I have to force you?

106
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,240
You, Lu,

107
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,030
who are you

108
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,990
to speak so boldly?

109
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,100
Who are you

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,000
to pretend to be a sheriff?

111
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,680
Boss,

112
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,880
we're exposed.

113
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
Who are you guys exactly?

114
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,310
And how did I expose myself?

115
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,260
Allow me to explain.

116
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't expect me to pay

117
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,370
those unreasonable heavy taxes.

118
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,750
If I do,

119
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,909
I'll be...

120
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,070
I'll be giving money to corrupt officials!

121
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,830
Well said!

122
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,790
The burdensome taxes

123
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,900
are indeed detestable.

124
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,350
However, as a sheriff,

125
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,350
collecting taxes is an important duty.

126
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,030
When I mentioned it,

127
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,310
your reaction

128
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,990
didn't match your status.

129
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,220
Of course,

130
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,590
at that time,

131
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,650
you hadn't been completely exposed.

132
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,160
I hadn't suspected you either.

133
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,110
After all, you are dignified,

134
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,070
conducted the investigation properly,

135
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,430
questioned sharply,

136
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,590
and your method of comparing footprints

137
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,670
was admirable.

138
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,630
Unfortunately, what followed...

139
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,190
Although

140
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,080
Wannian County has only you as its sheriff,

141
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,030
I believe

142
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,060
you will assist the magistrate

143
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,950
in efficiently governing

144
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,950
the area east of Zhuque Avenue.

145
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,470
Of course.

146
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,000
As soon as I arrive in the capital

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,270
I will sweep away all the thieves and robbers

148
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,470
from Wannian County.

149
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,730
You claimed to be a sheriff

150
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,510
who was promoted to take office in Wannian County.

151
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,500
Yet, you're unaware that Wannian County, which is under the jurisdiction of the capital,

152
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,550
has six sheriffs:

153
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,350
Superintendent of Household,

154
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,300
Superintendent of Warehouse, Superintendent of Officials, Superintendent of Soldiers,

155
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,230
Superintendent of Construction, Superintendent of Justice.

156
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,270
If you, an imposter,

157
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,930
really arrive in the capital,

158
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,950
it'll be ridiculous.

159
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,110
Six sheriff?

160
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,200
What's the point of having so many officials?

161
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,120
Brothers, I see.

162
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,830
Lu and Su

163
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,050
must be officials.

164
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,160
Let's kill them first!

165
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,990
Wait a minute!

166
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,990
I'm not good at fighting.

167
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,910
You do it.

168
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,790
You can't gang up three against one!

169
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,480
Gentlemen,

170
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,910
we are already

171
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,240
in the same boat

172
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,440
Aren't you going to lend a hand?

173
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,470
Mr. Lu, I'll help you!

174
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,550
Thank you.

175
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,790
You're welcome.

176
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,840
Mr. Lu, catch the sword!

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,630
You're quite good at martial arts.

178
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,990
You didn't win fairly.

179
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,950
Why did you say that?

180
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,750
My brother was captured.

181
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,310
My heart was burning with anxiety.

182
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,710
That was why I exposed myself.

183
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,370
Otherwise,

184
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,470
little boy,

185
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,110
you would have long

186
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,260
died under my blade.

187
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,990
You knew

188
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,150
I would pass through here,

189
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,550
so you set up the trap in advance, right?

190
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,270
You officials are so ruthless.

191
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,130
You actually killed a Sogdian

192
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,120
to lure me in.

193
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,990
So be it.

194
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,470
Let today

195
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,030
be the day I reunite

196
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,290
with my wife and children.

197
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,200
You didn't win fairly.

198
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,440
There were three of you fighting against me alone!

199
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,950
There were three of you too!

200
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,990
And you ambushed us.

201
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,590
Moreover,

202
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,500
he was not using a handy weapon.

203
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,250
Then let's fight with handy weapons.

204
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,670
Just you wait.

205
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,590
This fake sheriff is so arrogant.

206
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,120
Teach him a good lesson.

207
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,590
Yes.

208
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,270
Do it.

209
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,750
I, Long,

210
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,430
only ask for a quick death.

211
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,190
That won't do.

212
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,630
Just now you interrogated us.

213
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,310
Now it's our turn

214
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,630
to interrogate you, right?

215
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,550
I was originally from a decent family

216
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,150
in Yunding County, Hanzhou.

217
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,670
My family made a living by making wine.

218
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,230
Twenty years ago,

219
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,710
we encountered a corrupt and tyrannical sheriff who

220
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,570
imposed all sorts of harsh taxes,

221
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,430
making it

222
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,520
hard for us to make a living.

223
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,340
My father

224
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,910
was forced to the point of coughing blood and died.

225
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,740
I wanted to avenge him,

226
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,790
so I became an apprentice to learn martial arts,

227
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,650
which took me ten years to master.

228
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,570
Unexpectedly,

229
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,310
that sheriff had already been promoted

230
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,750
and went off somewhere else

231
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,070
to make a fortune.

232
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,680
I took over my father's wine making business,

233
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,760
got married, and had children.

234
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,820
We had a few good years.

235
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,110
Then,

236
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,890
another sheriff came,

237
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,240
who was even more corrupt and tyrannical

238
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,030
than the one

239
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,590
who drove my father to death.

240
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,830
I had a quarrel with him,

241
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,420
then I was thrown into prison.

242
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,470
He even wanted to seize

243
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,190
our family's ancestral wine cellar.

244
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,810
My wife went to plead with him,

245
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,540
but he attempted to harass her.

246
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,350
Unable to bear the humiliation,

247
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,350
she took our child

248
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,150
and jumped into the river

249
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,670
After receiving the news in prison,

250
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,510
I managed to break out

251
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,050
and nearly beat him

252
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
to death.

253
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,400
Then why

254
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,560
didn't you kill him?

255
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,630
Despite my ten years of martial arts training,

256
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,090
I had never killed anyone.

257
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,390
Seeing that corrupt sheriff living in luxury,

258
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,590
I was filled with rage

259
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,070
and robbed him clean.

260
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,570
Since then,

261
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,080
I've been wandering in Jianghu

262
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,020
and met these two brothers.

263
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,070
Their experiences are pretty much

264
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,390
the same as mine.

265
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,050
All three of us despise

266
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,150
sheriffs who impose heavy taxes and extort money from the people.

267
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,340
So wherever we go,

268
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,280
we steal everything

269
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,350
from the sheriff's household.

270
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,990
However,

271
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,720
the sheriff of Shen County is quite clean.

272
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,150
There is no illicit gain at his home at all.

273
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,480
I heard he's a young man.

274
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,400
I'd really like to meet him.

275
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,850
Can having no illicit gain at home

276
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,520
prove he's a good official?

277
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,550
I've inquired about it.

278
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,270
Last year, there was a locust plague

279
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,330
and many fields had no harvest at all.

280
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,110
This young sheriff

281
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,800
spent all his own money on disaster relief.

282
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,330
Isn't that a good official?

283
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,020
Alright.

284
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,770
Enough talking about others.

285
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,000
Let's talk about you now.

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,810
Why were you heading to Chang'an

287
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,040
in the name of the sheriff

288
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,150
of Wannian County?

289
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,740
I heard that

290
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,100
there are sheriffs in the capital too.

291
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,630
I imagined they must have more illicit gains.

292
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,590
You're really bold.

293
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,510
Indeed.

294
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,320
Daring to impersonate a sheriff?

295
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,640
The moment I walked in,

296
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,030
I could tell he was up to no good.

297
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,630
Everyone,

298
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,550
now you know

299
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,030
I've been wrongly accused, right?

300
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,830
Hurry up and untie me!

301
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,030
Though you didn't kill him,

302
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,310
the stolen goods are right here.

303
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,750
You can't say you were wrongly accused of theft, can you?

304
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,870
A bit of pilfering on a journey

305
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,260
is understandable.

306
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,530
You really are shameless.

307
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,120
Why are you, a young girl,

308
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,750
so fierce?

309
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,390
Daring to contend with men,

310
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,190
you'll never get married.

311
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,590
My marriage is not your concern.

312
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll cut out your tongue first!

313
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,530
Yingtao!

314
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,590
The fake sheriff Long Tai

315
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,870
and his two accomplices

316
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,000
have been captured.

317
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,150
However, the true murderer of Mi Tuo

318
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,890
has not been found yet.

319
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,870
Who do you think

320
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,960
is the most suspicious?

321
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,300
It's not me anyway.

322
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,910
Nor me.

323
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,050
Since

324
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,200
the fake sheriff has been exposed,

325
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,500
the real sheriff

326
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,080
should stop hiding.

327
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,350
Could it be

328
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,030
that Mr. Lu is the sheriff?

329
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,230
I'm Lu Lingfeng,

330
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,440
on my way to take office as the sheriff of Yunding County.

331
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,830
Long Tai,

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,600
remember.

333
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,560
After I take office in Yunding,

334
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,430
I will definitely not arbitrarily collect harsh taxes and levies.

335
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,290
As for those old and unjust cases,

336
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,240
I will investigate them one by one.

337
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,270
If that's true,

338
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,890
it will be a blessing for Yunding.

339
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,630
Hermit and Swordsman,

340
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,230
keep an eye on these people

341
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,470
while I

342
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,200
inspect the ancestral hall again.

343
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,380
I... I'll go light the candles first.

344
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,920
Fei.

345
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,569
What are you doing?

346
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,430
Back in Shiyang,

347
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,810
I saw that the female coroner Cao Hui,

348
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,750
while examining the body,

349
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,880
was quite imposing.

350
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,250
I, Physician Fei,

351
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,750
also want to learn and practice.

352
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,470
I just touched him

353
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,369
all over,

354
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,640
and there were no injuries.

355
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,650
The fatal wound

356
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,870
is right at the back of the head.

357
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,750
Step back.

358
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,350
Long Tai's judgment was correct.

359
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,880
He died from a heavy blow to the back of the head by a heavy object.

360
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,190
A hammer?

361
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,950
No

362
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,230
A pickaxe?

363
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,600
Not that either.

364
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,550
It should be something

365
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,470
like a shovel.

366
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,870
Using a shovel to kill?

367
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,320
Mi Tuo was quite strong.

368
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,980
The person who used the shovel

369
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,110
must have considerable arm strength.

370
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,810
I feel like something is missing

371
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,320
in this ancestral hall.

372
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,470
What is it?

373
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,550
There must be something missing.

374
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,870
Xijun is very skilled in painting,

375
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,190
able to remember scenes she sees

376
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,190
and never forget.

377
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,120
She shouldn't be mistaken.

378
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,790
But

379
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,340
what exactly is it?

380
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,770
I remember now!

381
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,070
It's a pearl.

382
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,540
The pearl

383
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,440
between the statue's fingers.

384
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,710
Oh, yes.

385
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,490
Mi Tuo

386
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,060
even smelled it

387
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,690
when he was wiping the statue.

388
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,740
Now that you mention it

389
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,630
I remember too.

390
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,910
There was indeed a pearl.

391
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,630
It was there when Mi Tuo moved in,

392
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,160
but now it has disappeared?

393
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,910
Search carefully again.

394
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,150
Yes, look for it.

395
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,230
Where could it have gone?

396
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,830
Su Wuming,

397
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,130
why aren't you searching with us?

398
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,820
I'm thinking

399
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,990
that this Mi Tuo was a Sogdian,

400
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,070
known for their ability to recognize treasures.

401
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,190
Perhaps it was because of this pearl

402
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,740
that he insisted on

403
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,470
living in this ancestral hall.

404
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,650
That makes sense.

405
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,350
Pearl, oh pearl,

406
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,870
who put you here?

407
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,780
What a waste of a precious treasure.

408
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,020
Mi Tuo was very cautious.

409
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,560
Even when drinking,

410
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,750
he kept his backpack on.

411
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,190
It was because

412
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,180
of this priceless pearl.

413
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,280
That was why he...

414
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,150
So,

415
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,140
Mi Tuo was excited because of getting the pearl

416
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,150
and went to the front hall to get wine.

417
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,560
And Lan Juzi took the opportunity to steal his backpack.

418
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,550
Well, the murderer...

419
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,510
There were no more footprints in the snow.

420
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,590
The murderer must have been hiding

421
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,510
in the ancestral hall for a long time.

422
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,340
Who says you have to walk through the snow

423
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,510
to enter the ancestral hall?

424
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,940
Su Wuming,

425
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,110
you reminded me.

426
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,470
Xijun,

427
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,870
do you remember when we first entered the ancestral hall

428
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,110
and you said you felt cold?

429
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,640
As soon as I stepped inside,

430
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,830
I felt a chill too.

431
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,360
While it's common for ancestral halls

432
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,550
to be rundown

433
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,990
with leaky roofs,

434
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,340
there's something

435
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,390
strange there.

436
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,180
Stay back.

437
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,970
You are doing this because we can't go up there,

438
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,690
right?

439
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,710
What did he see?

440
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,870
Yingtao,

441
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,640
why don't you go up there and take a look for us?

442
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,230
No, no, no.

443
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,080
Don't listen to Fei.

444
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,140
He's examining the footprints.

445
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,830
If too many people go up there, the footprints will get messed up.

446
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,080
There's a skylight in the second-floor storage room.

447
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,940
The murderer must have sneaked into

448
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,200
the top of the ancestral hall from there,

449
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,000
then jumped down

450
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and killed Mi Tuo.

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,430
This person must be very skilled in flying skill.

452
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,960
Although no footprints were left in the snow,

453
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,430
there are rows of footprints on the roof of the ancestral hall

454
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,510
and on the roofs

455
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,590
of the wing-rooms.

456
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,710
What's suspicious is that,

457
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,860
judging by the size of the footprints,

458
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,310
they were left by different people.

459
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,080
Who could they be then?

460
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
Isn't everyone here?

461
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,660
No.

462
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,390
No, from the time we entered the shop until now,

463
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,720
two people are missing.

464
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,010
Besides the landlady,

465
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,350
there's also the old waiter who ran away.

466
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,910
That old waiter

467
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,770
must have gone out through the back door, jumped onto the courtyard wall,

468
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,030
entered the forest behind the mountain.

469
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,110
And then, when we weren't looking, he returned

470
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,420
and sneaked into the ancestral hall and killed him.

471
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,740
That makes sense.

472
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,590
Because

473
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,680
he knew

474
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,170
that Mi Tuo was living in the ancestral hall.

475
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,310
However,

476
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,550
there's another possibility.

477
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,780
Tying the red ribbon

478
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,190
was probably a way

479
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,670
to tell the accomplice outside

480
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,650
that someone was living in the inn.

481
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,630
When the accomplice came back

482
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,990
and saw the red ribbon,

483
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,710
he went around to the forest behind the mountain.

484
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,640
Then he jumped over the courtyard wall and entered the ancestral hall.

485
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,470
That's so creepy.

486
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,480
And the other row of footprints

487
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,740
is even more terrifying.

488
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,020
Swordsman was right.

489
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,030
Everyone alive is here.

490
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,630
Unless...

491
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,130
Unless the landlady came back to life.

492
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,710
The landlady is dead?

493
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,160
It was before you came here.

494
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,120
There was another murder before this,

495
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,350
and you deliberately concealed it?

496
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,670
Come on, Long.

497
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,470
Do you still think you're a sheriff?

498
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:13,830
I...

499
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,870
Come on, get him down.

500
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,750
Open the tank.

501
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,750
The rope is intact.

502
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,350
Yingtao.

503
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,280
Where is him?

504
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,310
Well...

505
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,090
Where is the corpse?

506
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,820
Then there must be something wrong with this tank.

507
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,020
While playing with the Tokhara knives,

508
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,510
the lid of this large tank was open the whole time.

509
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,390
Perhaps

510
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,980
it's a place that the landlady

511
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,860
intentionally left for herself

512
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,790
to hide her body.

513
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,770
Your analysis is correct.

514
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,470
Perhaps this is the truth.

515
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,390
Let me take a look.

516
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,500
Yingtao, be careful.

517
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,240
Don't worry.

518
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,510
Fortunately, there's this girl.

519
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,510
The entrance of the hole is so narrow.

520
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,350
We men

521
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,000
simply cannot fit through.

522
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,590
There's no dust inside the cave.

523
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,670
The walls are smooth.

524
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,330
It seems that someone crawls in here regularly.

525
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,240
If I'm not mistaken,

526
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,640
that landlady must have taken some medicine

527
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,270
to temporarily stop her breath.

528
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,400
That can't be right.

529
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,750
I saw the dagger piercing into her chest

530
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,780
with my own eyes.

531
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,190
We were so close.

532
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,790
The blood was...

533
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,390
Hermit Jiang,

534
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,600
it even stained all over your hand.

535
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,030
All these are just petty tricks.

536
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,070
Attach two blood packs separately

537
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,350
to the chest and back.

538
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,790
Use the Tokhara knife to squeeze,

539
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,350
and the blood will come out.

540
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
Now, the most important thing is...

541
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,670
The most important thing

542
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,490
is that we can't keep living in this inn.

543
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:42,970
It's...

544
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,430
As Fei just said,

545
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,180
if she took medicine

546
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,010
to temporarily stop her breath,

547
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,450
she could wake up later

548
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,550
and use this underground passage

549
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,710
to crawl out from behind the counter.

550
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,180
Then, when no one was paying attention,

551
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,870
she could go upstairs

552
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,870
and get onto the roof of the ancestral hall

553
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,790
through the skylight in the storeroom.

554
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,880
It was she who killed Mi Tuo?

555
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,630
But because I arrived in time,

556
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,350
she didn't have time to hide the corpse.

557
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,750
That's possible.

558
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,590
But from Mi Tuo returning to the ancestral hall

559
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,740
with food and drink,

560
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,730
to being killed,

561
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,750
and then to the body being discovered,

562
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,080
the time was very short.

563
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,990
Where could the landlady

564
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,030
who committed the murder be hiding?

565
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,890
When we were expressing our feelings in the snow,

566
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,090
did you hear the sound?

567
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,770
Who's in there?

568
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,590
Come out!

569
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,720
Come out now!

570
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,670
I heard it very clearly.

571
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,880
It did come from the direction of the ancestral hall.

572
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,800
Now that I think about it

573
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,400
that sound was not from

574
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,950
inside the ancestral hall,

575
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,440
but from underneath it.

576
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,470
There seems to be a hollow sound underground,

577
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,130
but I didn't find an entrance.

578
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,190
This Mo's Inn

579
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,790
is really deceiving people with false appearances.

580
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,230
This remote inn

581
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,910
was built entirely

582
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,750
to conceal something.

583
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,590
Building so many houses

584
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,260
just to conceal something?

585
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,030
How big of a business are they trying to do?

586
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,310
Fei didn't pay for the chicken.

587
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,510
The waiter refused to let him leave,

588
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,800
but the landlady let him go.

589
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,490
We wanted to stay at the inn,

590
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,960
but she forced us to show our skills

591
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,630
and demanded a high price.

592
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,290
Actually, she was just driving us away.

593
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,150
So, it seems that

594
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,780
she definitely didn't open this inn

595
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,130
to make money.

596
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,040
That's right

597
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,310
Before,

598
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,310
there was no remote inn here.

599
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,510
Except for this ancestral hall,

600
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,510
all the buildings

601
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,920
are newly constructed.

602
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,420
Your inn

603
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,570
must have been open for about 7 or 8 years, right?

604
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,950
I mean,

605
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,940
you must have some aged wine in storage, right?

606
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:46,750
Of course.

607
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,090
You have a good eye.

608
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,310
My inn

609
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,170
has been open for 10 years.

610
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,490
Of course we have some aged fine wine.

611
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,440
Hermit Jiang asked this

612
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,510
to test the landlady.

613
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,120
Mr. Su, you have a good memory.

614
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,170
You found out she was lying,

615
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,090
but why didn't you expose her?

616
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,810
The answer I'm seeking

617
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,670
is not that simple.

618
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,910
So

619
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,130
I've been patiently waiting.

620
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,500
Patience and determination.

621
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,230
Admirable.

622
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,550
Even the landlady's feigned death

623
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,990
couldn't make you

624
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,250
reveal your identity.

625
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,610
Sheriff Lu has already figured out

626
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,220
that you are not a cultivator.

627
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,740
My inn

628
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,850
has been open for 10 years.

629
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,230
Of course we have some aged fine wine.

630
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,230
Serve the dishes.

631
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,390
This hermit has an unknown background.

632
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,070
We don't know if he's a friend or foe.

633
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,070
How about we invite him to join us for a drink

634
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,910
and find out?

635
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,140
Mr. Jiang,

636
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,750
I saw your impressive illusion skills just now.

637
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,550
You were able to evoke

638
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,190
the essence of Scholar Yangxian.

639
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,390
It was truly amazing.

640
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,630
Since we met in this remote inn

641
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,070
on this snowy night,

642
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,710
would you like to join us for a drink?

643
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,160
It turns out

644
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,590
my disguise

645
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,920
has never deceived you.

646
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,910
And yet I've been pretending all along.

647
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,970
I'm truly ashamed.

648
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,280
When we were being questioned,

649
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,170
Sheriff Lu

650
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,380
said his name was...

651
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,870
My name is Lu Wuming.

652
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,200
While Mr. Su said...

653
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,190
I...

654
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,910
am Su,

655
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,680
Su Lingfeng.

656
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,470
Now that

657
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,320
Sheriff Lu has revealed

658
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,150
his real name,

659
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,470
Lu Lingfeng,

660
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,880
if I'm not mistaken,

661
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,200
Mr. Su, your real name should be

662
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,500
Su Wuming.

663
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,750
Correct.

664
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,470
It is really you two.

665
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,430
You have solved numerous challenging cases in Chang'an.

666
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,390
Your reputation has long spread to Shen County.

667
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,450
Today, meeting you

668
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,700
is my honor.

669
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,790
Well, Mr. Jiang,

670
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,190
please reveal your real name too.

671
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,550
I am Jiang Wei,

672
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,850
[Jiang Wei, Sheriff of Shen County]

673
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,990
the sheriff of Shen County.

674
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,030
Another sheriff?

675
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,960
Including this former sheriff

676
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,820
of Chang'an,

677
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,110
there are four sheriffs, real or fake, in total.

678
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,310
Today, it seems

679
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,310
we've arrived at the sheriffs' den.

680
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,820
You're the sheriff of Shen County?

681
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,670
You've been to my residence?

682
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,910
I have.

683
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,870
Those ten silver ingots

684
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,880
were left by you?

685
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,110
It was because you are too poor.

686
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,550
That money was of unknown origin.

687
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,130
I have already handed it over to the government office.

688
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,370
But

689
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,390
I thank you

690
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,860
for your kindness.

691
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,470
You really don't need to do this.

692
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,630
Get to the point.

693
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,640
Sheriff Jiang,

694
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,400
why did you come here this time?

695
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,470
Several days ago,

696
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,110
dozens of construction workers

697
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,440
suddenly went missing.

698
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,230
Through investigation,

699
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,270
I found out they were hired

700
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,310
to build an inn.

701
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,830
I searched through neighboring counties

702
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,510
and finally pinpointed this place.

703
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,239
It is located

704
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,159
in a remote area of Shen County.

705
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,949
Due to unusual weather changes,

706
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,210
it's commonly known as

707
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,340
the Snow Nest.

708
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,570
Dozens of construction workers?

709
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,110
No wonder there are

710
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,340
so many sets of bowls and chopsticks in the kitchen.

711
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,320
So many people?

712
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,560
Could they be here to rob tombs?

713
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,429
This is the site of the Six Dynasties Vajra Temple.

714
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,070
There shouldn't be any ancient tombs here.

715
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,770
Digging for gold?

716
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,190
You, Su,

717
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,630
when you mentioned spring onions and leeks before,

718
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,389
you were referring to gold and silver

719
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,790
on this mountain, right?

720
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,860
Good hearing, Mr. Jia.

721
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,470
But I remember,

722
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,110
when I said those words,

723
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,680
you were in the room

724
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,790
drinking with Mi Tuo, right?

725
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,870
I...

726
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,170
So many people came all of a sudden.

727
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,130
Of course I should listen.

728
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,310
It's possible that they're illegally

729
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,240
digging for gold and silver here.

730
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,220
Mr. Su,

731
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,310
may I take a look

732
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,570
at this terrifying statue again?

733
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,430
Does it

734
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,630
have a pearl between its fingers?

735
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,870
It originally did.

736
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,650
That's right then.

737
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,950
This is the White Brow Immortal,

738
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,770
worshipped by treasure hunters.

739
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,090
-A treasure hunter?
-A treasure hunter?

740
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,780
They're people who specialize

741
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,310
in finding treasures for their employers

742
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,950
in exchange for money.

743
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:01,870
Exactly.

744
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,660
They only care about money

745
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,830
and use any means necessary.

746
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,310
The treasures they seek are all priceless.

747
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,330
I've heard that

748
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,060
before the jade of the He family

749
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,250
was made into the Imperial Jade Seal,

750
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,550
someone offered

751
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,910
10,000 taels of gold to find it.

752
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,740
Wait a minute.

753
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,350
Catch it!

754
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,760
The 19th year of Jianyuan?

755
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,070
Jianyuan?

756
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,430
This is Fu Jian's third reign title.

757
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,160
I never expected this ancestral hall

758
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,710
to truly be built in the Six Dynasties period.

759
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,870
When we entered the courtyard

760
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,200
we felt this ancestral hall was peculiar.

761
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,910
Didn't you say this place

762
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,290
was the site of some Vajra Temple?

763
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,260
Pagoda?

764
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,510
This ancestral hall

765
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,130
should be the top tier of the pagoda.

766
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,220
Since childhood, I've been drawing

767
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,830
the Big Wild Goose Pagoda in Chang'an.

768
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,160
How could I not have thought of it earlier?

769
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,250
Sheriff Jiang,

770
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,950
has Shen County ever experienced

771
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,080
a major earthquake?

772
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,750
Yes.

773
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,790
According to county records,

774
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,670
during the decline of the Sui Dynasty, a massive earthquake

775
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,530
caused significant devastation

776
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,000
and houses to collapse.

777
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,670
Now it appears

778
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,550
that during the Six Dynasties period, the Vajra Temple

779
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,550
sank underground

780
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,730
due to the earthquake,

781
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,320
leaving only the top tier.

782
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,030
Those so-called treasure hunters

783
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,190
built this inn in the wilderness

784
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,710
to steal treasures

785
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,990
from the temple.

786
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,350
However, they couldn't avoid

787
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,610
guests coming to stay.

788
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,760
So, the landlady started playing

789
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,120
the life-gambling game

790
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,890
to drive away overnight guests.

791
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,180
I found it.

792
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,390
The tongue relic of Master Mosha.

793
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,160
The master was called

794
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,190
the foremost lecturer of scriptures in the world.

795
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,320
After his nirvana, his tongue transformed into a relic.

796
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,590
According to this book,

797
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,080
half of the relic

798
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,350
is housed in Hui'an Temple in Hanzhou,

799
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,960
and the other half is hidden

800
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,680
in the Vajra Temple where the master

801
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,950
attained Buddhahood.

802
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,350
How much is this worth?

803
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,490
We Tang people believe

804
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,750
the value of the tongue relic of Master Mosha

805
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,880
is second only to the Buddha's relics,

806
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,630
making it

807
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,250
a priceless treasure.

808
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,560
I've also heard of this treasure.

809
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,730
If that's the case,

810
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,390
there must be a hidden passage

811
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,380
to the underground in the ancestral hall.

812
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,440
I'll go look again.

813
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,630
Fresh bloodstain?

814
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,380
It must have been left by the murderer

815
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,760
when fleeing after killing Mi Tuo.

816
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,830
This place is in Shen County.

817
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,390
Sheriff Jiang, if you intend to track down the murderer,

818
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,150
I'm willing to lend a hand.

819
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,250
Thank you, Sheriff Lu.

820
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,600
I am determined to apprehend the real murderer

821
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,400
and also find the whereabouts

822
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,730
of those dozens of construction workers.

823
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,430
Hold on.

824
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,670
Judging by the ingredients in the kitchen

825
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,240
and the number of utensils,

826
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,980
there are quite a few people down there.

827
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,890
You two

828
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,240
don't have enough strength to fight them.

829
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,830
These so-called treasure hunters

830
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,030
are ruthless characters.

831
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,230
Everyone,

832
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,070
would you be willing to help?

833
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,210
Sheriff Jiang,

834
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,760
can Long Tai and his brothers

835
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,270
redeem themselves through service?

836
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,220
Although

837
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,710
I have no authority to absolve you

838
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,910
of the crime of impersonating a sheriff and committing theft,

839
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,590
if you make a contribution in capturing the bandits,

840
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,710
I will vouch for you

841
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,590
when handing you over to the state government.

842
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,670
Untie me, please.

843
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,830
Although I can't fight,

844
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,470
if there's a large amount of treasure below,

845
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,930
I can help transport it up.

846
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,190
Mi was my friend.

847
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,370
I must be involved

848
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,790
in catching his murderer.

849
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,330
I'm willing to take the lead.

850
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,680
I just need a share of the treasure.

851
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,180
That's great.

852
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,050
Swordsman,

853
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,990
you and Lu Lingfeng lead the way,

854
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,290
with Sheriff Jiang covering the rear.

855
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,250
Untie them.

856
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,230
You three, come here.

857
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,310
Hurry. Hurry.

858
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,070
Hurry!

859
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,040
Someone locked the door.

860
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,630
We're not very lucky.

861
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,440
If we break the lock,

862
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,610
it will definitely make a noise.

863
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,070
If they have set an ambush,

864
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,210
it will be

865
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,680
impregnable.

866
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,000
Listen, people down there!

867
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,320
My master is kind-hearted

868
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,450
and doesn't want to kill you!

869
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,990
What a pity.

870
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,580
Even playing with the Tokhara knife

871
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,980
couldn't scare you away.

872
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,350
I have no choice but to be a bad guy

873
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,230
and send you to hell.

874
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:14,790
Oh no,

875
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,990
the retreat route is blocked.

876
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,870
It sounds like the old waiter.

877
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,790
Those at the top, hurry and fight your way back.

878
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,310
He's alone, so he shouldn't be hard to deal with.

879
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,550
It's too late.

880
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,830
Haven't you noticed?

881
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,480
The stairs are covered in copper oil.

882
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,210
He's planning to attack us with fire.

883
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,580
Don't make a sound,

884
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,400
to avoid alerting them.

885
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,670
It's cramped here,

886
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,600
if there's fire above,

887
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,420
we'll definitely be burned to death.

888
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,830
What should we do?
