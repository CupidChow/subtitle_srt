4
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,430
Get down.

5
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,070
Get down.

6
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,400
Get down.

7
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:11,790
Get down.

8
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,870
Stop. I confess.

9
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,590
I confess.

10
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,120
-I confess.
-I'll go first.

11
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,110
You just saw

12
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,230
a small part of the files.

13
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,210
There were many other files

14
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,410
in the file room.

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,690
It was on fire 3 days ago.

16
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,390
-All those files were burned.
-All those files were burned.

17
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,030
Wait.

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,870
They said what I wanted to say.

19
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,400
We didn't mean to lie to you.

20
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,090
We were just

21
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,350
afraid of

22
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,750
being held accountable.

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,790
Where were the burned files kept

24
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,790
before the fire?

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,230
A big cabinet used to be here.

26
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,920
All the files were in it.

27
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,550
But somehow,

28
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,110
it caught fire.

29
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,350
Where is the cabinet?

30
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,270
It was burned.

31
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,420
Nothing left.

32
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,550
How many files were in it?

33
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,590
More than 100.

34
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,190
What?

35
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,840
214 files.

36
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,750
What were the cases?

37
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,910
All kinds of cases.

38
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,190
I don't remember exactly.

39
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,920
No one knows about them better than Sheriff Sima.

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,190
Case files were burned in a fire.

41
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,090
It's a big deal.

42
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,400
I want to know

43
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,170
how Sima Liang was punished.

44
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,890
He wasn't punished.

45
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,829
Unbelievable!

46
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,430
Sheriff Lu, calm down.

47
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,710
I remember at that time,

48
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,910
the magistrate said…

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,390
I didn't say I won't punish you.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,390
I just think of your hard work all these years

51
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,770
and decide to let you off.

52
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,430
That's it?

53
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,210
How should I put it?

54
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,070
Sima Liang should have resigned long ago.

55
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,200
It's because you didn't show up

56
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,350
that he took your place for the time being.

57
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,950
When an accident happened during this period,

58
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,760
it was not proper to punish him.

59
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,600
Then what about the responsible personnel?

60
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,230
We have night shifts,

61
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,860
but no one specifically watches the file room.

62
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,880
So no one at all

63
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,790
was punished?

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,730
Mr. Song, do you know

65
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,950
what cases

66
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,300
those files were about?

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,390
I have no idea.

68
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,060
Here.

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,750
But you definitely remember

70
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,310
the murder cases among them.

71
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,370
No murder cases.

72
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,550
Just a few

73
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,590
missing persons…

74
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,210
cases.

75
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,710
I was on night duty 3 days ago.

76
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,020
Around midnight,

77
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,210
someone sneaked in

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,630
and set fire to the Back and Western Offices

79
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,430
and the file room at the same time.

80
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,270
Naturally, we hurried to the Back Office first.

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,190
By the time we put out

82
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,390
the fire in the file room,

83
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,530
the cabinet

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,060
had been burned to ashes.

85
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,590
That night, the magistrate and I

86
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,760
were also in the county office.

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,910
What he said is true.

88
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,280
Suo Long.

89
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,610
Since you were on duty that night,

90
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,620
I can punish you for negligence of duty.

91
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,550
But how and when you'll be punished

92
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,690
depends on your performance.

93
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,920
Thank you, Sheriff Lu.

94
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,070
Mr. Song said

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
there were disappearances.

96
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,990
Can you find those

97
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,090
who reported them?

98
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,010
It's hard to find them.

99
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,720
No problem.

100
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,570
I'll get on it right away.

101
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,390
Sheriff Lu,

102
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,710
you're working too hard

103
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,240
on your first day in office.

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,600
Solving crimes

105
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,970
is the duty of a sheriff.

106
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,550
Whether it's my first day or not,

107
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,810
I must be worth my salt.

108
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,480
Mr. Song.

109
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm going back to the Western Office.

110
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:50,940
Go.

111
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,470
Yes!

112
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,690
Sheriff Lu.

113
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,710
I've sent them out to look for those

114
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,040
who reported the cases.

115
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,150
Sheriff.

116
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,670
I want to ask

117
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,190
if the Wolf Tendon really can detect lies.

118
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,750
I feel

119
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,270
it's the smoke…

120
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,360
Sheriff.

121
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,980
Sheriff.

122
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,370
A new case is reported.

123
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,000
Sheriff.

124
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,580
Please find her for me.

125
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,390
Calm down.

126
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,640
Take your time.

127
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,780
Qing Xi

128
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,100
is missing.

129
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,710
Who is Qing Xi?

130
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,490
Qing Xi is my neighbor.

131
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,860
And who are you?

132
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,380
I'm Wang Qiu.

133
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,430
Wang as in Wang Bo.

134
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,430
Qiu means a loach.

135
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,990
Doesn't Qing Xi have any family?

136
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,600
Why are you reporting her missing?

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,530
She has a husband

138
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,590
called Bao Kang.

139
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,750
He can't come himself

140
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,210
because he broke his legs.

141
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,560
Let's go.

142
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,400
Lead the way.

143
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,640
This way.

144
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,170
Sheriff Lu.

145
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,270
I can see that

146
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,950
you're very capable.

147
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,320
I truly admire

148
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,670
a sheriff like you.

149
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,610
From now on,

150
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,830
I'm at your disposal.

151
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,000
No need for that.

152
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,390
Just work hard.

153
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,950
Okay.

154
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,220
Here we are.

155
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,030
This is Bao Kang's house.

156
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,720
Sheriff,

157
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,430
please.

158
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,900
Shoo, shoo, shoo.

159
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,330
Bao Kang.

160
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,710
The constables are here!

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Forget it.

162
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,159
It's a waste of time.

163
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,820
He broke both his legs

164
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,180
and can't come down.

165
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,070
He got angry

166
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,790
when neighbors visited him.

167
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,820
I'm Lu Lingfeng, the new sheriff.

168
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,590
Sheriff?

169
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,020
Are you here to help me find my wife?

170
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,190
Tell me

171
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,830
what happened.

172
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,790
I made a living by collecting herbs.

173
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,750
Two months ago,

174
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,510
in the mountains,

175
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,679
I accidentally fell off a cliff

176
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,490
and broke both my legs.

177
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,919
Yesterday, at dusk,

178
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,280
Qing Xi brought my dinner upstairs

179
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,880
and went to the bookstore to return a book,

180
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,550
but she didn't come back.

181
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,790
Where is the bookstore?

182
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,440
Ruyu Bookstore,

183
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,610
at the night market.

184
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,990
The night market?

185
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,810
So Qing Xi disappeared at night?

186
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,960
Bao Kang, right?

187
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,490
How is your relationship with your wife?

188
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,470
Pretty good.

189
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,280
Then why do you sleep in separate beds?

190
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,730
It's because I'm injured.

191
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,430
That only makes you

192
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,110
need taking care of, doesn't it?

193
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,240
Let me ask you again.

194
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,050
How is your relationship with your wife?

195
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,710
Bad.

196
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,310
They fought a lot.

197
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
Now tell me,

198
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,830
did Qing Xi act unusually before she disappeared?

199
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,510
Or,

200
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,120
was there anything that seemed odd to you?

201
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,910
No.

202
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,190
Wang Qiu.

203
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,240
Yes.

204
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,230
You're young

205
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,480
but quite smart.

206
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,990
Before we find Qing Xi,

207
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,090
you'll take care of him.

208
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,590
I don't need to be taken care of,

209
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,870
especially not by him!

210
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,830
Do you think

211
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,540
I want to take care of you?

212
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,550
The county government will pay you for it.

213
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,590
-Then I'd love to take care of him.
-But

214
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,990
you need to be attentive.

215
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,410
He's a patient.

216
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,160
If anything happens to him,

217
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,510
you won't get paid

218
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,430
and will have to answer to me!

219
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,560
Rest assured, Sheriff.

220
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,970
Take care, Sheriff.

221
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,200
Bao Kang.

222
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,070
Did you hear

223
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,650
what the sheriff said?

224
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,610
Now,

225
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,640
you have to listen to me.

226
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,700
He asked you to look after me.

227
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,280
What's the difference?

228
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,950
You have to do whatever I say.

229
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,190
You can't yell at me

230
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,770
as you did with Qing Xi.

231
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,800
Otherwise,

232
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,410
I-I'll beat you up.

233
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,080
You...

234
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,870
Don't be smug, you despicable brat!

235
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,080
I may be childish

236
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,700
like Qing Xi said,

237
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,710
but I'm not despicable!

238
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,640
It's your fault

239
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,000
that Qing Xi is missing!

240
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,650
You should have been nicer to her!

241
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,290
I need to teach you a lesson

242
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,550
for Qing Xi.

243
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,430
Take this!

244
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:06,910
Brat!

245
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,160
What are you doing?

246
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,880
-How dare you bully Qing Xi!
-Get off me!

247
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,480
Take this!

248
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,350
A girl is missing.

249
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,010
It's a serious matter.

250
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,840
You two,

251
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,370
return to the county office

252
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,130
and have the scribe draft a missing person notice.

253
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,430
Offer a reward for any leads.

254
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,820
Send all available personnel out

255
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,020
to look for that girl.

256
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,090
-Yes!
-Yes!

257
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,040
Suo Long.

258
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,510
Yes.

259
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,350
Take me to Ruyu Bookstore.

260
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,670
Yes.

261
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,280
[Ruyu Bookstore]

262
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,710
That girl named Qing Xi

263
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,940
did come to return a book last night.

264
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,430
I'd like to return it.

265
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,230
You finished it so soon?

266
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,010
Is The Immortal's Cave

267
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,890
worth reading?

268
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,310
The rent.

269
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Your deposit.

270
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,190
A new book

271
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,670
has arrived recently.

272
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,470
It's called The Tale of Sass.

273
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,330
It's even more interesting

274
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,790
than The Immortal's Cave.

275
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,720
She left right after returning the book.

276
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,050
Was there anything unusual

277
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,050
when she was here?

278
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,520
She seemed downhearted.

279
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,340
Oh right.

280
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,560
She smelled of alcohol.

281
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,350
Besides…

282
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,550
You see her?

283
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,990
That girl read The Immortal's Cave.

284
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,200
How surprising.

285
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,390
She's definitely a charming little wench.

286
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,620
We met again.

287
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,880
Isn't it fate?

288
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,390
I saw

289
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,840
Wu Cai go after her.

290
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,310
Who is Wu Cai?

291
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,860
I know that guy.

292
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,190
Many people in Yunding know him.

293
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,870
He's a notorious scoundrel.

294
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,350
He lives right ahead.

295
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,290
A scoundrel visited a bookstore?

296
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,230
That guy

297
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,830
is a scoundrel,

298
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,840
but he's not illiterate.

299
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,950
But the books he borrowed

300
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,260
were all erotic ones.

301
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,190
Like The Tale of Sass.

302
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,920
In Yunding,

303
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,110
books like The Tale of Sass

304
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,810
can be rented and sold freely?

305
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,330
The Tale of Sass in my store

306
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,600
has two volumes.

307
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,880
The first volume

308
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,340
does have erotic content.

309
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,790
But the second volume

310
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,070
is about the story

311
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,170
of a guy called Lu Lingfeng

312
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,740
and a guy called Su Wuming

313
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,190
who joined hands

314
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,890
to kill Sass

315
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,550
and uphold justice.

316
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,990
They're legends.

317
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,230
Sounds like

318
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,760
it's a nice book.

319
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,230
But many people,

320
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,020
especially those like Wu Cai,

321
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,840
only borrow the first volume.

322
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,720
Let's go.

323
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:00,990
Wu Cai.

324
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,970
S-Sheriff Lu.

325
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,580
Get the coroner here.

326
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,070
We don't have a coroner.

327
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,030
How is that possible?

328
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,670
It's true.

329
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,910
We had an old coroner,

330
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,040
but he died long ago.

331
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,430
How were murder cases

332
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,290
solved before?

333
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,070
Sheriff Sima is versatile.

334
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,910
He examined the bodies himself.

335
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,490
Sheriff Lu.

336
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,520
Can't you do an autopsy?

337
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,900
I don't know much.

338
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,240
I thought all sheriffs

339
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,370
could do an autopsy.

340
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,710
There are two opposing arcs

341
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,990
on the side of his neck.

342
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,430
Bleeding can be seen.

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,180
It's obviously a bite,

344
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,170
a forceful one.

345
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,470
On the back of his head, near his neck,

346
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,710
his scalp splits

347
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,130
from the bottom up,

348
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,090
likely due to blunt force trauma.

349
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,710
From his neck to his back,

350
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,150
there are multiple slashes.

351
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,150
Got that.

352
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,200
What a dusty room.

353
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,420
Looks like a very sloppy guy lived here.

354
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,110
Yes.

355
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,790
Wu Cai is a slob.

356
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,290
Sheriff Lu,

357
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,830
your butler

358
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,590
is so capable.

359
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,590
Su Wuming.

360
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,150
Since when

361
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,300
have you become Lu Lingfeng's butler?

362
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,750
Hold on.

363
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,490
Su Wuming?

364
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,870
I just heard this name

365
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,870
in the bookstore.

366
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,710
You two are from Chang'an.

367
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,490
The second volume of The Tale of Sass

368
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,250
is about

369
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,890
your story, right?

370
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,510
You talk

371
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,430
too much.

372
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,800
Sorry, Sheriff Lu.

373
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,190
The bite

374
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,150
was from Qing Xi, right?

375
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,270
If Qing Xi bit him,

376
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
it must be for self-defense.

377
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,060
I just checked around.

378
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,160
No murder weapon

379
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,670
in this house.

380
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,970
Qing Xi went out to return a book.

381
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,680
It's not likely that

382
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,300
she'd bring a knife with her.

383
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,420
You mean the murderer

384
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,980
is someone else?

385
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,319
Just a mahogany wood sword.

386
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,310
Look.

387
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,710
Brown fabric.

388
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,630
Officer Suo.

389
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,069
Yes.

390
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,089
Check his bedroom,

391
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,819
see if he has any brown clothes.

392
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,589
Okay.

393
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,830
Su Wuming.

394
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,870
That Wolf Tendon you gave me

395
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,190
came in handy.

396
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,190
The lazy constables

397
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,400
and the defiant Officer Suo

398
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,550
are all working hard now.

399
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,440
What's great is not the Wolf Tendon

400
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,550
but the way you used it.

401
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,300
I checked all of his clothes.

402
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,110
No brown ones.

403
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,530
[Anda Inn]

404
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,830
Give it to me.

405
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,630
Someone died?

406
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,830
A murder case

407
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,330
on his first day in office.

408
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,110
What a rough start.

409
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,390
Get out! Get out!

410
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,670
Get out!

411
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,310
What made you think we abducted him?

412
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,240
He did stay here,

413
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,790
but we didn't tie him up

414
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,920
and couldn't stop him from going out.

415
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,570
What if he was money-obsessed

416
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,810
and went to Yunding Immortal Steps?

417
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,960
How is that my fault?

418
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,160
My nephew is a timid boy.

419
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,150
He wouldn't possibly go there!

420
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,100
If you don't return him to me,

421
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,830
I'll go to the government

422
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,830
to sue you!

423
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:45,910
Go ahead!

424
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,160
You threw baseless accusations at me.

425
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,300
I should sue you!

426
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,870
You…

427
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,360
Zhuan,

428
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,870
where on earth did you go?

429
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,580
Sir,

430
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,190
what happened?

431
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,270
Someone said,

432
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,710
right in this inn,

433
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,820
he saw my nephew Zhuan.

434
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,350
I waited for him for days,

435
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,740
but he didn't show up.

436
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,270
So I came to this inn to look for him.

437
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,030
However,

438
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,710
he's missing.

439
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,700
Don't worry.

440
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,990
Could it be that

441
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,710
he moved to another inn?

442
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,750
Impossible.

443
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,830
Look, his luggage is still here.

444
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,910
Zhuan used to live in Shazhou.

445
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,790
He's good at Sogdian Whirl.

446
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,870
In his letter, he said

447
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,710
there was no curfew in Yunding,

448
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,710
so he wanted to come to me

449
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,670
and dance here

450
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,950
to make some more money.

451
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,870
Sir,

452
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,830
you just mentioned a place called

453
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,170
Yunding Immortal Steps.

454
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,300
What is that place?

455
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,550
Go away.

456
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,070
Find it out yourself.

457
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,690
Like I care.

458
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,430
Yunding Immortal Steps?

459
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,410
Sheriff Lu.

460
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,410
You want to see me?

461
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,070
Take me to Sima Liang's house.

462
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,940
What do you want to do?

463
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,460
Pay a visit to my predecessor.

464
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,720
It's common courtesy.

465
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,710
Lead the way.

466
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,060
Mr. Sima,

467
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:29,670
I…

468
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,970
This is Sheriff Lu.

469
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,430
I've just arrived in Yunding.

470
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,890
I'm here to pay you a visit.

471
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,310
Although I'm senior to you,

472
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,690
you don't need to be so polite.

473
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,360
I've come to visit you

474
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,250
and also to ask you something.

475
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,190
Can I

476
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,070
have a word with you inside?

477
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,380
My house is shabby.

478
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,990
Just ask

479
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,760
your question here.

480
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,950
Before you left office,

481
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,920
the file room caught fire.

482
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,870
214 case files

483
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,220
were burned to ashes.

484
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,510
I want to know

485
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,190
what kind of cases

486
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,520
those files were about.

487
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,600
All kinds of cases.

488
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,710
Fist fights.

489
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,900
Burglaries.

490
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,400
Robberies.

491
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,470
Frauds.

492
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,780
Several homicides

493
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,710
and missing persons.

494
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,790
How many missing persons cases were there?

495
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,590
Half, I guess.

496
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,710
What?

497
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,180
Half.

498
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,950
Why are you so surprised?

499
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,600
In a place like Yunding,

500
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,500
people come and go every day.

501
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,390
It's quite normal for some people

502
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,720
to leave with caravans.

503
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,510
So reported disappearances

504
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,270
don't mean people have really gone missing.

505
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,750
Then do you think

506
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,170
those cases are the result

507
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,900
of lifting the curfew?

508
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,350
The lifting of the curfew

509
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,350
was proposed and implemented by me.

510
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,070
What?

511
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
You think it was a mistake?

512
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,060
Your words, not mine.

513
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,690
Do you mean to go against me?

514
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,290
Without any evidence,

515
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,150
you try to accuse your predecessor.

516
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,070
Lu,

517
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,010
being as inept as you are,

518
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,470
how did you get the court

519
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,730
to replace me with you?

520
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,650
You're quite good-looking.

521
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,430
Did you

522
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,810
pull strings to be an informal official?

523
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,820
Don't fight!

524
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,550
Don't fight!

525
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,820
Mr. Sima, Sheriff Lu.

526
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,010
I look up

527
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,010
to both of you.

528
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,360
Please don't fight.

529
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,100
Don't fight.

530
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,080
Don't fight.

531
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,480
Don't fight.

532
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,850
Please.

533
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,510
Su Wuming.

534
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,670
We're supposed to do this together.

535
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,150
As the butler,

536
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,430
how can you slack off?

537
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,670
Uncle Fed.

538
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,960
I'll do his part.

539
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,620
You…

540
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,310
I wish someone could

541
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,870
care for me like this.

542
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,670
Fed.

543
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,390
Come here.

544
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,350
Take a look. What is this model?

545
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,030
It's indeed a model.

546
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,150
Right.

547
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,070
The person who lived here

548
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,620
was a market supervisor.

549
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,830
Could this be

550
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,830
the model of Yunding City?

551
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,950
No way.

552
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,430
Yingtao and I

553
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,310
walked around Yunding yesterday.

554
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,990
It's on a plain.

555
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,270
But this is obviously

556
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,390
upon a hill.

557
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,430
What is a market supervisor?

558
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,330
Every market

559
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,030
has four sections: east, west, south, and north.

560
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,190
Shops are categorized

561
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,270
based on these sections.

562
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,400
A market supervisor

563
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,670
is someone who oversees

564
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,730
different trades.

565
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,790
Despite working for the government,

566
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,450
they aren't considered government officials.

567
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,870
Am I right, Brother?

568
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,830
Yes.

569
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,440
The Yunding government

570
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,390
is so stingy.

571
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
Can't they rent a new house

572
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,510
for us?

573
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,610
Why do we have to live here?

574
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,340
That old man surnamed Lyu

575
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,200
has been missing for half a month.

576
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,340
Maybe he's already dead.

577
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,470
If that's the case,

578
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,870
this place is very likely haunted, isn't it?

579
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,360
Chicken Fed.

580
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,700
Don't scare me.

581
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,590
What's scary about a haunted house?

582
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,650
Didn't we stay in one back in Hanzhou?

583
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,240
Besides,

584
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,550
with Su Wuming and Lu Lingfeng around,

585
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,190
even if we don't stay in a haunted house,

586
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,630
creepy things will still happen.

587
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,090
There's no avoiding them.

588
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,280
You have a point.

589
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,390
Enough.

590
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,460
Hurry up and clean the house.

591
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Sheriff Lu will be back soon.

592
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,650
Sima Liang was the sheriff for many years.

593
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,970
He worked hard and contributed a lot.

594
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,760
Why did you have to mess with him

595
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,690
on your first day in office?

596
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,670
Indeed.

597
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,480
You don't know it, Sheriff Lu.

598
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,110
Sima Liang is a much-loved official in Yunding.

599
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,540
If you want to gain a foothold here,

600
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,740
making an enemy of him

601
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,510
is not a wise move.

602
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,060
I work for the court

603
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,710
and the people.

604
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,760
I'm not afraid of making enemies.

605
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,870
By contribution,

606
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,030
do you mean the lifting of the curfew?

607
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,700
Yunding's businesses are flourishing.

608
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,490
The wine here is renowned all over the country.

609
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,290
Sima Liang did contribute a lot.

610
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
Sima Liang admitted himself

611
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,270
that half of the 214 case files

612
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,190
were missing persons cases!

613
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,640
That's over

614
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,750
100 lives.

615
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,010
What kind of contribution

616
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,610
can make up for that mistake?

617
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,350
That many?

618
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,930
I don't know the exact number,

619
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,380
but it shouldn't be that many.

620
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,650
A guy called Zhao Yu

621
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,980
came here from Qinzhou.

622
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,190
Mr. Song,

623
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,310
have you met him?

624
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,650
What?

625
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,630
He went to you too?

626
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,720
His brother Zhao Lei

627
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,240
was indeed my classmate,

628
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,690
but he never came to Yunding to see me.

629
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,170
When I passed Hanzhou,

630
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,430
I saw a mute slave

631
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,910
with distorted features.

632
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,400
He had the same red string

633
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,230
as Zhao Yu.

634
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,420
I think

635
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,480
he was your classmate,

636
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,470
Zhao Lei.

637
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,270
No way.

638
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,790
A slave?

639
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,020
A mute slave?

640
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,340
What's going on?

641
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,710
Zhao Yu came to you

642
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,430
but didn't file a report.

643
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,290
In other words,

644
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,510
people who went missing in Yunding

645
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,310
are more than just a hundred.

646
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,790
You two said

647
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,750
Lyu Xianke, the market supervisor,

648
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,410
disappeared half a month ago.

649
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,720
What did that mean?

650
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,570
It meant he went missing.

651
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,380
Did anyone report it?

652
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,320
The case files were all burned.

653
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,070
Magistrate Huangfu,

654
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,550
you're in charge of Yunding.

655
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,190
Mr. Song,

656
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,910
you're the magistrate's assistant.

657
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,510
So many people went missing.

658
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,240
Aren't you responsible at all?

659
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,310
Well…

660
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,010
Song Shang!

661
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,370
What's your problem?

662
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,150
You failed to perform your duty!

663
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,950
Sorry, sorry.

664
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,620
I failed to perform my duty.

665
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,430
Sheriff Lu, do you have the confidence

666
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,270
to solve these

667
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,270
missing persons cases?

668
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,610
I only have a guess now.

669
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,990
I suspect that

670
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,770
there's a secret organization here

671
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,090
that kidnaps people

672
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,870
and uses unknown methods

673
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,520
to make them mute

674
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,270
and disfigure them

675
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,700
before selling them as slaves in other places.

676
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,270
How horrifying!

677
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,370
Is it sorcery?

678
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,400
Lu Lingfeng,

679
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,110
are you exaggerating things

680
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,690
to make a mark?

681
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,950
If I'm proven right,

682
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,160
will you take the responsibility?

683
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,590
Well…

684
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,070
Mr. Lu,

685
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,350
you lived in the capital

686
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,990
and never worked in a county before.

687
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,850
There are things you may not know.

688
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,760
Actually, since ancient times,

689
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,070
every place has had

690
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,170
missing people every year.

691
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,920
People go missing now and then.

692
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,230
It's quite common.

693
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,950
You're a descendant of Grand Commandant Huangfu.

694
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,750
If I'm proven right,

695
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,610
with all the incidents that happened

696
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,060
under your administration,

697
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,190
you'll bring disgrace on your family.

698
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,250
That doesn't happen now and then.

699
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,800
It's not common at all.

700
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,510
You…

701
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,710
It's…

702
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,320
[Yunding County Government]

703
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,230
Wait, Mr. Lu.

704
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,710
Mr. Song?

705
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,540
I'll make it short.

706
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,110
You're righteous

707
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,230
and eloquent.

708
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,150
No wonder His Majesty

709
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,770
trusts you more than anyone else.

710
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,060
I really admire you.

711
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,990
Sheriff Lu.

712
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,590
You're finally back.

713
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,210
You must be tired.

714
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,750
Yingtao and I prepared this.

715
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,390
Don't hold back on your compliments.

716
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,590
We can take them.

717
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:52,910
What?

718
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,810
You've all eaten already?

719
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,050
Well,

720
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,790
there's chicken and wine at the night market.

721
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,510
I can smell them

722
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,910
even from here.

723
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,590
I really don't want to eat at home.

724
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,060
Yingtao said

725
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,400
the three myrobalan decoction there

726
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,460
is very delicious.

727
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,050
I want to try it.

728
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,990
Why are you all so into drinking

729
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,390
after coming to Yunding?

730
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,000
Not just drinks.

731
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,840
There are also delicacies

732
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,800
and local specialties.

733
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,330
Oh right.

734
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,990
There's also camel meat.

735
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,470
I've never tried it before.

736
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,270
Actually,

737
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,640
I didn't plan

738
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,230
to cook tonight.

739
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,110
I thought we

740
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,210
could all eat at the night market.

741
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,960
But Su Wuming said

742
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,670
you definitely wouldn't go with us,

743
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,330
so we prepared dinner for you.

744
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,590
We all eat at the night market?

745
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,870
Are we rich?

746
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,670
We're running out of money, aren't we?

747
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,120
It's still a while before the payday.

748
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,810
In the coming days,

749
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,280
what will we eat?

750
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,320
You all have a silver ingot?

751
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,880
How did you get them?

752
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,280
Nothing illegal.

753
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,480
I gave it to them.

754
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,470
You just came to Yunding.

755
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,510
How could you get silver ingots?

756
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,830
Can't they be a reward?

757
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,550
From whom?

758
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,540
You don't need to know.

759
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,270
Huangfu Tan

760
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,400
is so wealthy.

761
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,910
It's not the magistrate.

762
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,190
Then is it his assistant?

763
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,390
Why do you have to get to the bottom of it?

764
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,630
Since you have money,

765
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,770
go eat at the night market if you want.

766
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,510
I'm not going anyway.

767
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,300
Let's go.

768
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:34,920
Let's go.

769
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,130
Su Wuming has to stay.

770
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,950
Why do I have to stay?

771
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,040
You're my personal secretary.

772
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,420
Huangfu Tan asked me to call you my butler.

773
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,550
If your employer chooses to stay home,

774
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,730
what should you do?

775
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,870
I should…

776
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,780
I should stay and serve you.

777
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,350
Then, I…

778
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,360
Let's go.

779
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,290
[Nan's Tavern] [Three myrobalan decoction]

780
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,870
Will they fight?

781
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,030
Fight?

782
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,470
Su Wuming is no match for Lu Lingfeng.

783
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,730
Lu Lingfeng appears arrogant,

784
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,990
but deep down,

785
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,740
he respects Su Wuming very much.

786
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,710
Su Wuming taught him a lot.

787
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,230
They're friends

788
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,050
and also teacher and student.

789
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,630
Lu Lingfeng relies on

790
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,000
Su Wuming a lot.

791
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,290
So don't worry.

792
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,550
They won't fight.

793
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,870
Your drink.

794
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,830
Here.

795
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,950
Please enjoy.

796
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,720
Your cup.

797
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,430
Your cup.

798
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,190
Cheers.

799
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:47,930
Cheers.

800
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,000
It tastes great.

801
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,460
A bit sweeter

802
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,990
than Yunding Red.

803
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,550
I wonder what Eternal Drunkenness

804
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,390
tastes like.

805
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,670
You mean, in Yunding,

806
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,020
there's an organization that sells slaves?

807
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,510
Yes.

808
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,270
They use sorcery to make people mute

809
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,110
and disfigure them.

810
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,810
Did you tell your guess

811
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,080
to Huangfu Tan

812
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,630
and Song Shang?

813
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,510
Yes.

814
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,470
Normal people

815
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,830
were turned into mute slaves.

816
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,120
That may be

817
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,230
Zhao Lei's case,

818
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,790
but the missing market supervisor

819
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,070
is over 70 years old.

820
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,550
How can he

821
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,230
be of any worth

822
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,590
as a slave?

823
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,490
I forgot about him.

824
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,570
Missing people

825
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,790
are common in Yunding.

826
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,740
We met one too during the day.

827
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,670
By the way,

828
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,600
we heard of a place

829
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,990
called

830
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,190
Yunding Immortal Steps.

831
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,590
Very mysterious.

832
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,030
We said we were going to the night market

833
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,110
but actually planned to go to that

834
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,870
Yunding Immortal Steps

835
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,630
to try to find some clues for you.

836
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,590
Why didn't you say so?

837
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,470
After I finish,

838
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,530
we'll go together.

839
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,510
Give me one.

840
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,020
I can't go with you

841
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,180
on an empty stomach.

842
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,900
You haven't eaten either?

843
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,850
I forgot.

844
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,790
If I had known

845
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,430
I'd eat at home,

846
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,110
I'd have prepared something nice.

847
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,140
Sheriff Lu.

848
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,790
Mr. Su.

849
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,680
Are you two going out?

850
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,310
Then shall we talk about it in the county office tomorrow?

851
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,770
Have you found something?

852
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,870
Just now, a woman came to the county office,

853
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,080
claiming to be

854
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,240
Qing Xi's neighbor.

855
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,730
Where is she?

856
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,090
Greetings, Sheriff.

857
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,610
My surname is Sun.

858
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,280
[Ms. Sun, Qing Xi's neighbor]

859
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,880
Everyone calls me Ms. Sun.

860
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,150
Ms. Sun.

861
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,960
I'm a widow and live alone.

862
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,010
With nothing to do,

863
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,090
I pay close attention

864
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,060
to what's happening

865
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,190
in my neighborhood.

866
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,870
I usually report to the district chief,

867
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,750
but this time,

868
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,969
I heard that Qing Xi was murdered,

869
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,719
so I came straight to the county office.

870
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,520
No one said Qing Xi was murdered.

871
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,980
She's just missing.

872
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
What's the difference?

873
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,989
Sheriff, come closer.

874
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,679
Stay back.

875
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,139
Just say it.

876
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,940
Alright.

877
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,989
I'm just not used to it.

878
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,310
Here's the thing.

879
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,239
The day before yesterday, at dusk,

880
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,150
I saw the little brat

881
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,270
Wang Qiu

882
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,920
come out of Bao Kang's house

883
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,900
with a kitchen knife in his hand.

884
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,540
Qing Xi.

885
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,870
Bao Kang is badly injured.

886
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,800
I don't think he can stand up again.

887
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,830
Without you looking after him,

888
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,920
he'd starve to death.

889
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,130
Instead of being grateful,

890
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,929
he scolded

891
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,920
and insulted you

892
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,190
and threw things around.

893
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,250
It's infuriating.

894
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,290
Qing Xi.

895
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,350
Should I

896
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,710
go up

897
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,090
and teach him a lesson?

898
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,090
Just say the word.

899
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,040
I can even kill him for you!

900
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,210
You're so bold.

901
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,010
Don't say such crazy things

902
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,750
again.

903
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,410
I have even crazier things to say.

904
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,550
Qing Xi.

905
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,670
You're my dream girl.

906
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,150
For you,

907
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm willing to do anything.

908
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,350
I'm willing

909
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,510
to kill Bao Kang for you.

910
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,830
You're really crazy.

911
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,230
That's so cheesy.

912
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,160
Alright, kiddo.

913
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,150
I know you want to help me,

914
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,390
but you can't

915
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,010
joke about killing someone.

916
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,810
Don't even think about it.

917
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,230
Qing Xi.

918
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,280
I know you think I'm too young,

919
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,440
but I'll do something big for you.

920
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,430
That little brat

921
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,100
brazenly harassed Qing Xi.

922
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,650
If you ask me,

923
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,430
I'd say Wang Qiu

924
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,050
saw Bao Kang bedridden

925
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,690
and kidnapped Qing Xi.

926
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,790
Qing Xi fought back

927
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,730
and was killed.

928
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,140
That brat

929
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,840
sneaks around and steals.

930
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,320
There's nothing he won't…

931
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,800
Look at me.

932
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,510
I'm doing it again.

933
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,440
It's a habit of mine.

934
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,380
I happened to witness

935
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,190
such a serious matter.

936
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,270
I heard everything

937
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,930
they said loud and clear.

938
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,970
I have to report it to you.

939
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,320
As for the reward,

940
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,350
I've never thought about it.

941
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,680
Is there anything else?

942
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,670
That's all.

943
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,550
Do you recall the color

944
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,760
of the clothes Wang Qiu

945
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,160
was wearing that day?

946
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,480
Gray?

947
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,310
No.

948
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,570
I remember.

949
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,750
It was brown.

950
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:45,870
Suo Long.

951
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,510
I'm not doing this for the reward.

952
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,030
Thank you.

953
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,480
Wang Qiu.

954
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,170
I forgot to ask you last time.

955
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,630
What do you do for a living?

956
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,040
I'm jobless.

957
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,110
Yet you kept a pig?

958
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,760
That's not my pig.

959
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:20,870
One day,

960
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,630
I came back from the night market

961
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,760
and saw it wandering outside my house.

962
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,100
It looked so pitiful,

963
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,430
so I took it in.

964
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,830
I didn't expect it

965
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,160
to eat even more than me.

966
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,510
I had no choice

967
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,480
but to kill it for meat.

968
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,280
Wang Qiu.

969
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,020
Your neighbor

970
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,290
said you harassed Qing Xi.

971
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,790
Is that true?

972
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,670
Neighbor?

973
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,400
You mean Feng Er?

974
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,350
Well,

975
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,160
Feng Er didn't snitch on you.

976
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,760
I don't care who said it.

977
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,890
I do like Qing Xi.

978
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,650
It's not a crime, is it?

979
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,350
Besides,

980
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,510
I reported

981
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,580
her missing.

982
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,620
You asked me to look after Bao Kang,

983
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,740
and I did my best.

984
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,240
I even carried him to the toilet once.

985
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh right.

986
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,210
One man is suspicious.

987
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,180
I heard Bao Kang argue with Qing Xi

988
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,820
over that man.

989
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,030
Don't give me that.

990
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,510
Now that I'm a cripple,

991
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,290
you look down on me

992
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,920
and don't want to stay at home anymore.

993
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,430
Go to Jin Bao if you want.

994
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,860
He's able-bodied

995
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,660
and strong.

996
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,200
I already know.

997
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,630
You've shamelessly

998
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,030
hooked up with him!

999
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:25,910
All you think about

1000
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,110
is Jin Bao now, right?

1001
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,430
Jin Bao?

1002
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,790
Who is he?

1003
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,090
A huntsman.

1004
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,830
He often went hunting

1005
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,560
with Bao Kang

1006
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,920
and ate at his house.

1007
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,310
After you met Qing Xi,

1008
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,030
what did you do?

1009
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,760
Did you kill the pig?

1010
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,150
No.

1011
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,350
I heard Bao Kang humiliate Qing Xi

1012
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,750
and felt so sorry for her.

1013
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,790
I wasn't in the mood for that.

1014
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,860
So I

1015
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,900
went home and slept.

1016
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,550
Last night,

1017
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,950
you wore this coat, right?

1018
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,530
Yes…

1019
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,990
Yes.

1020
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,360
On the right sleeve.

1021
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,310
Yunding doesn't have a curfew.

1022
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,620
It's normal to go out at night.

1023
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,230
Why are you lying?

1024
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,590
I-I'm not lying.

1025
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,920
Then why

1026
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,870
is there a hole here?

1027
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,350
A hole?

1028
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,870
What hole?

1029
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,590
I remember.

1030
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,290
Half a year ago,

1031
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,170
I drank too much

1032
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,310
and tripped.

1033
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,960
The scissors in my hand

1034
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,190
poked a hole in it.

1035
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,500
First of all, this hole

1036
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,800
shouldn't be from half a year ago.

1037
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,710
Secondly,

1038
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,630
if it was left by something sharp,

1039
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,600
the hole

1040
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,030
shouldn't be in that shape.

1041
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,110
This hole

1042
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,230
is a triangle.

1043
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,310
It should be something like a nail

1044
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,580
that tore a hole

1045
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,290
in the worn sleeve.

1046
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,360
I don't understand

1047
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,800
what you're talking about.

1048
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,030
This

1049
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,650
was found on a nail in Wu Cai's house

1050
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,980
from which a mahogany wood sword was hung.

1051
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,440
Wu Cai is already dead.

1052
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,110
The murderer is very likely

1053
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,990
the owner of this strip of cloth.

1054
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,790
Tell the truth!

1055
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,000
I confess.

1056
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,510
That day,

1057
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,880
I was worried about Qing Xi,

1058
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,840
so I followed her.

1059
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,880
But before I realized it,

1060
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,950
I lost her.

1061
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,470
Wang Qiu?

1062
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,080
What are you doing here?

1063
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,790
Nothing.

1064
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,090
Just hanging out.

1065
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,650
You're not telling the truth.

1066
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,850
Which house is the target?

1067
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,950
Count me in.

1068
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,030
What are you talking about?

1069
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,580
Am I that kind of person?

1070
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,020
Then who was the one

1071
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,050
who did those things with me?

1072
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,460
That's water under the bridge.

1073
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,870
I've turned over a new leaf.

1074
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,350
Turned over a new leaf?

1075
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,770
It's worth celebrating.

1076
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,140
I came into a windfall yesterday.

1077
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,040
Let's go.

1078
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,540
I'll buy you drinks.

1079
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,690
Suit yourself.

1080
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,150
Dear,

1081
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,710
let's go over there.

1082
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,380
Okay.

1083
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,790
Don't go. Have another drink.

1084
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,270
No.

1085
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,070
I can't drink anymore.

1086
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,130
Another time.

1087
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,100
After you lost Qing Xi,

1088
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,750
how long was it

1089
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,050
before you saw her

1090
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,080
come out of Ruyu Bookstore?

1091
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,480
An hour.

1092
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,230
Go on.

1093
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,800
I could tell that man was up to no good,

1094
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,130
so I caught up in a hurry.

1095
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,700
How could I let anyone

1096
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,630
hurt Qing Xi?

1097
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,650
Beautiful.

1098
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,180
Don't you remember me?

1099
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,910
We met once at Flying Fairy Body Art Store.

1100
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,840
What do you want?

1101
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,870
We meet again.

1102
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,720
Don't you think it's fate?

1103
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Since you love The Immortal's Cave,

1104
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,900
come to my place to read it.

1105
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,720
Scoundrel.

1106
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,860
-How do you know my nickname?
-Let go of me!

1107
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:39,790
Help!

1108
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,430
Come on, girl.

1109
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,390
Let go of me!

1110
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,740
Let go of me!
