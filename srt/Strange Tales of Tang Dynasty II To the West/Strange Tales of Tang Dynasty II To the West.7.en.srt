[Episode 7]

4
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,030
In the autumn of 712,

5
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,229
the emperor abdicated the throne.

6
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,570
The crown prince ascended the throne

7
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,229
and named the new period Xiantian.

8
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,590
His Majesty has just ascended the throne.

9
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,990
He has a lot to deal with.

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,520
He has no time for you.

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,590
Please tell His Majesty

12
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,390
I won't leave

13
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,870
until he agrees to see me.

14
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,810
[Supreme Court]

15
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,079
Greetings, Your Highness.

16
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,680
I'm at your service.

17
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,870
I doubt that.

18
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,020
I invited you twice,

19
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,490
but you kept making excuses

20
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,590
and wouldn't come to the Princess' Palace,

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,030
so I have to invite you myself.

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,430
They say you threaten to stick around

23
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,890
if I don't agree to see you.

24
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,150
I must see you.

25
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,190
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,140
Rise.

27
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,470
What's the emergency?

28
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,790
Please forgive me for holding something back.

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,960
[Emperor]

30
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,070
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,910
Lu Lingfeng

32
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,830
has another identity.

33
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,300
Let me elaborate on it…

34
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,270
privately.

35
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,890
Chamberlain Yang,

36
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,310
General Lu Tong,

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,050
and Bai Shan

38
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,250
are all trustworthy.

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,170
How private do you want it to be?

40
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,790
Just say it.

41
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,270
Here's the thing.

42
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,470
When I investigated the Face Flower case in Luoyang,

43
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,310
I already suspected that

44
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,910
Lu Lingfeng's relationship

45
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,950
with Her Highness

46
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,090
was special.

47
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,910
But the situation was unclear,

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,640
so I kept quiet about it.

49
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,990
Now that

50
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,710
you've ascended the throne,

51
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,460
I think

52
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,850
I must tell you

53
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,310
the truth.

54
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,150
Ji'er.

55
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,580
You saved my life again.

56
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,670
How should I thank you?

57
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,470
You were frightened.

58
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,510
I'm glad you're fine.

59
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,830
I'm asking you.

60
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,880
What reward do you want?

61
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,510
How about a mansion?

62
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,110
The Heavenly Empress once gave one to me.

63
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,769
It's close to the Leyou Plain.

64
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,269
Thank you, Your Highness.

65
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,350
I live alone

66
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,200
in the Supreme Court

67
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,150
so I can check the files anytime.

68
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,070
It's time for you to get married.

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,740
Pei Jian's daughter

70
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,710
is not bad.

71
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,540
She's a good match for you.

72
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm going to hold

73
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,980
the grandest wedding in Chang'an

74
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,480
for you and her.

75
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,950
Please don't.

76
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,540
What's wrong?

77
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,510
You don't like her?

78
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,190
I do.

79
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,830
It's just that

80
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,400
I don't want to get married yet.

81
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,370
Your Highness.

82
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,630
That day, I was insolent

83
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,870
and called you something improper.

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,930
It must have

85
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,910
embarrassed you so much.

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,990
Are you worried about that?

87
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,030
Don't be.

88
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,000
We might as well tell the world about it

89
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,150
to save us from more embarrassment.

90
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,730
Please don't do that.

91
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,990
What are you afraid of?

92
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,710
It was by accident

93
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,490
that he ascended the throne.

94
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,830
Sitting on the throne

95
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,990
doesn't mean he rules Tang.

96
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,750
The appointments of officials above the third rank

97
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,080
are still decided by the retired emperor.

98
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,680
How many officials in the court

99
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,720
have sided with him

100
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,920
of their own accord?

101
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,510
The power

102
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,500
is still in my hands.

103
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,230
So,

104
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,190
don't worry.

105
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,740
Revealing our relationship won't affect your career.

106
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,180
Why are you here

107
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,500
telling me this?

108
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,750
I know

109
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,909
you value Lu Lingfeng

110
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,800
very much.

111
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,930
But

112
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,030
his special relationship with Her Highness

113
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,710
has pushed him

114
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,830
to her side.

115
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,730
You must think carefully,

116
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,190
Your Majesty, about how to handle this matter.

117
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,830
Do you know what you're doing

118
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,790
is snitching?

119
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,270
I-I don't think so.

120
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,030
I'm doing this

121
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,910
for the stability of the country

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,950
and to share your burden.

123
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,460
Su Wuming.

124
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,030
Whether you're snitching or not,

125
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,370
just tell me

126
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,110
what you want.

127
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,500
You're an acting official now.

128
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,630
Do you want me

129
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,409
to remove the word "acting" from your title?

130
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,370
You should do that.

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,270
Given how talented I am,

132
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,270
I'm totally qualified

133
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,840
to be the Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

134
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,830
Actually…

135
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,180
What?

136
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,740
The position of President of the Supreme Court

137
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,830
has been vacant for many years.

138
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,790
If you can make an exception to promote me,

139
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,390
you'll have my unwavering loyalty!

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,590
Shut up!

141
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,040
For the sake of Detective Di,

142
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,840
I won't punish you too severely.

143
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,590
Effective immediately,

144
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,120
you're removed from your position and expelled from Chang'an!

145
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,730
Since you took office at the Supreme Court,

146
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,020
you've solved old cases

147
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,480
and eliminated traitors.

148
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,870
You're hard-working

149
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,640
and have a good reputation.

150
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,590
The important position

151
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,810
of President of the Supreme Court

152
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,870
should be given to someone like you.

153
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,510
No.

154
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,260
You refused me

155
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,720
again and again.

156
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,190
How can you refuse a mother's compensation

157
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,860
for her son?

158
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,380
I wouldn't dare, Your Highness.

159
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,340
Ji'er.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Sorry.

161
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,000
I was too young back then.

162
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,980
As your mother,

163
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,420
I didn't give you

164
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,740
what you deserved.

165
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,990
If I can't

166
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,330
do something for you,

167
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,810
I'll feel guilty.

168
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,630
Ji'er.

169
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,160
Don't refuse me again.

170
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,110
It's urgent.

171
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,570
Forgive me for barging in.

172
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,550
What is it?

173
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,030
What?

174
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,190
Guards!

175
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,800
Prepare horses.

176
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,400
You were dismissed so quickly.

177
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,000
I thought

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,830
I could eat two chickens every day

179
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,750
while staying with a fourth-ranked official like you.

180
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,680
Fourth-ranked?

181
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,630
Not for an acting official.

182
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,390
Brother,

183
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,030
are you leaving now?

184
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,630
Why don't you wait for Lu Lingfeng to come back?

185
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,660
I can't wait.

186
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,720
His Majesty is furious.

187
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,600
If I don't leave instantly,

188
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll be beheaded.

189
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,590
Mr. Lu.

190
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,310
What do you

191
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,450
think of Su Wuming?

192
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,800
Seeing Your Majesty on the throne,

193
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,960
he bent with the wind

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,030
and planned to use Lu Lingfeng

195
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,790
to climb up.

196
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,590
That man's known for being smooth and sly.

197
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,600
Given what happened today,

198
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,450
it's true.

199
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,110
Bai Shan.

200
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,810
I agree with Mr. Lu.

201
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,070
Go.

202
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,690
Chamberlain Yang.

203
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,550
I think

204
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,420
Su Wuming

205
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
is not worth your attention.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,110
But Lu Lingfeng

207
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,230
should be gotten rid of as planned

208
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,360
as soon as possible.

209
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,770
Stop hesitating.

210
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,710
You're on the throne,

211
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,190
but Her Highness still has a great deal of clout.

212
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,630
Among the seven prime ministers,

213
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,760
four are on her side.

214
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,680
As for military power,

215
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,140
the left Imperial Guards,

216
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,630
the left Yulin Army, the right Yulin Army,

217
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,590
and the Imperial Guards of the North Gate

218
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,270
are all controlled by her men.

219
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,310
Now,

220
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,790
Lu Lingfeng

221
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,120
has been proven to be the princess' son.

222
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,040
Whether

223
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,530
he was loyal to you before,

224
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,550
he's her son after all.

225
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,390
Besides,

226
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,520
Lu Lingfeng has been transferred,

227
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,550
but among the right Imperial Guards,

228
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,750
he still has a say.

229
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,500
If he switches sides at the critical moment,

230
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,160
there'll be nothing we can do.

231
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,230
Your Majesty.

232
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,630
Hesitation

233
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,150
leads to death.

234
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,580
If you had hesitated back then,

235
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,830
I'm afraid the one on the throne now

236
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,990
wouldn't be you

237
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,750
but Queen Wei.

238
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,620
Lu Lingfeng's relationship

239
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,700
with the princess

240
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,790
has been put on the table by Su Wuming.

241
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,110
If we kill him now,

242
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,990
the princess will feel targeted.

243
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,710
The timing is not good.

244
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,520
Who'd have known

245
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,750
Su Wuming would ruin our plan?

246
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,150
Your Majesty.

247
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,310
Even so,

248
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,350
we still can't

249
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,230
let Lu Lingfeng stay in the capital.

250
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,200
Here's the imperial edict.

251
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,550
Lu Lingfeng,

252
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,690
working at the Supreme Court,

253
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,430
solved many old cases,

254
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,020
but was negligent

255
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,780
in the case at Chengfo Temple.

256
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,440
Therefore,

257
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,750
he is demoted to the sheriff of Yunding County, Hanzhou,

258
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,080
and shall set off today.

259
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,870
In fact, away from power struggles,

260
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,670
life will be much easier.

261
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,270
Lush bamboo forests.

262
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,930
Fragrant flower valleys.

263
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,340
Spending the rest of your life

264
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,540
farming and reading.

265
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,690
Isn't it great?

266
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,950
The place where I want to spend the rest of my life

267
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,590
is Luoyang.

268
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,560
My master's tomb

269
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,910
is in Mangshan,

270
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,260
in the north of Luoyang.

271
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,170
For a hundred years, we shared the sunset.

272
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,570
Thousands of years later, we'd all be dust.

273
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,870
If I die,

274
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,890
I wish I could be buried next to my master.

275
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,350
Su Wuming.

276
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,400
What do you mean by that?

277
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,380
I was dismissed

278
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,000
because I wanted

279
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,070
to step on Lu Lingfeng

280
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,300
to advance my career.

281
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,720
You can even say I betrayed him.

282
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,300
You betrayed Lu Lingfeng?

283
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,240
I might believe that

284
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,070
if you hadn't traveled to Chang'an

285
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,940
all the way from Jiangnan.

286
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,670
I did that to become

287
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,060
the President of the Supreme Court.

288
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,270
My father once worked at the Supreme Court.

289
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,500
He committed suicide there

290
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,520
because of an unsolved case.

291
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,390
From then on, I made up my mind

292
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,500
to become the President of the Supreme Court

293
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,260
to delve into my father's case

294
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,030
and become the best detective

295
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,550
in Tang.

296
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,310
After I became an Imperial Scholar,

297
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,960
I didn't rush to take an official position.

298
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,650
Instead, I stayed by Detective Di's side,

299
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,640
hoping to be directly recommended

300
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,660
and gradually take control of the Supreme Court.

301
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,240
After so many years,

302
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,530
I finally got it off my chest.

303
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,350
It feels so good.

304
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,550
Su Wuming.

305
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,990
This is not who you are.

306
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,910
This is the real me,

307
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,750
plotting and scheming for half of my life

308
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,390
to rise to fame.

309
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,750
Now that I've provoked His Majesty,

310
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,700
it's all over for me.

311
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,400
You're different.

312
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,000
You're young.

313
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,210
Why stick with me?

314
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,640
Don't you love me at all?

315
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,110
Love?

316
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,070
What happened before

317
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,570
was all just an act.

318
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,550
I've never…

319
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,550
loved you.

320
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,100
Fine.

321
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,850
Whether you mean it or not,

322
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,120
Su Wuming,

323
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,050
since you've said so,

324
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
I'll leave.

325
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,290
From now on,

326
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,170
we'll go our separate ways

327
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,200
and never see each other again.

328
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,730
[Supreme Court]

329
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,270
I was negligent.

330
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,910
What did Su Wuming do?

331
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,390
Why was he dismissed?

332
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,400
He didn't say anything.

333
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,930
He left in a hurry,

334
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,830
leaving me behind.

335
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,270
Was it because of me?

336
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,380
You were the Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

337
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,840
Now, you're just an insignificant sheriff.

338
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,270
Instead of feeling bad for yourself,

339
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,330
you're worrying about someone else.

340
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,990
Well,

341
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,380
you're a friend

342
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,580
worth having.

343
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,310
You're indeed from the Lu family of Fanyang.

344
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,110
I respect you.

345
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,800
Isn't it good to be the sheriff of Yunding?

346
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,070
You can go anywhere from there,

347
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,790
and I heard it boasts good wine.

348
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,130
You'll like that place.

349
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,620
S-So,

350
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,870
you're taking me with you?

351
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,790
I, Lu Lingfeng,

352
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,760
love Tang, my home country,

353
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,150
but I love those around me more.

354
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,910
If Xue Huan

355
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,390
didn't need to stay here for school,

356
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,710
I'd bring him

357
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,550
to go west with us.

358
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,670
That's great.

359
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,829
Although you're just a sheriff,

360
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,910
offering me two chickens a day

361
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,589
shouldn't be a problem,

362
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,420
right?

363
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,360
Right?

364
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,260
There's also good wine.

365
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,990
Let me be the vanguard.

366
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,590
The west is different from the south.

367
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,450
It's going to be

368
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,830
a rough trip.

369
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,330
Let's go together.

370
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,700
When will we set off?

371
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,260
Today.

372
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,510
Today?

373
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,890
I need to prepare some good wine

374
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,870
for the trip.

375
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,990
Xijun.

376
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,950
Do you think it's too hasty?

377
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:53,820
I…

378
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,030
I don't need to pack anything.

379
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,630
As long as I'm with you,

380
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,510
I'm always at ease.

381
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,310
Su Wuming.

382
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,350
Her Highness has been waiting

383
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,610
for you for a long time.

384
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,290
Your Highness.

385
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,210
What brought you here?

386
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,650
I'm here to see you off.

387
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,290
I don't deserve such an honor.

388
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,790
I went to the court to meet the new emperor

389
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,270
and tried to plead for you.

390
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,510
But…

391
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,010
Your Highness.

392
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,110
You've been to the court?

393
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,550
Then you must have known what happened.

394
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,310
I was not thinking straight.

395
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,830
I snitched on you.

396
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,230
I deserve to die.

397
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,990
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

398
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,290
I just want to ask you,

399
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,540
is it worth it?

400
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,550
I don't know if it's worth it.

401
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,670
Nor do I know what else I can do.

402
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,800
It was not easy for you

403
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,710
to get a decent position.

404
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,550
You've ruined your career.

405
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,870

my career

408

is nothing.

409

With me by his side,

410
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,470
I doubt anyone dares

harm him.

412
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,510
You're right.

413
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,720
My biggest weakness

414
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,510
is that I tend to think too much

415
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,200
and don't have much courage.

416
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,420

419

With due respect,

I want to advise you…

422
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,070
Enough.

423
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,950
Go home and rest for a year or two.

424

426

Please take my advice.

429
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,750
Are you worried about me

430
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,310
or the future of Tang?

I can't make Tang prosper?

Greetings, Mr. Lu.

440
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,820
You were the Deputy President of the Supreme Court

441

but were demoted to the sheriff of Yunding.

It's good.

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,790

Stay away from him.

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,470
Do I have to be more clear?

453
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,130
If he hadn't snitched,

454
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,070
you wouldn't have been demoted.

00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,150

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,750
Such a despicable man…

457
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,520
deserves to die.

469

Looks like I underestimated him.

Yes, Your Highness.

a tomb of such size

480
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,590

00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,310
it's not child's play.

770
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,670
Assistant Xu,

771
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,630
what do you mean?

772
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,340
From the looks of him,

773
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,710
he's just arrived at Shiyang, right?

774
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,270
When did you hire him?

775
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,000
You don't look like a good man to me.

776
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,830
What sorcery did you use

777
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,230
to fool the magistrate in such a short time?

778
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,690
We need a coroner to examine the body.

779
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,990
Are you a coroner?

780
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,910
No.

781
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,740
Then you're not qualified.

782
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,750
Get out!

783
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,900
I'm a coroner!

784
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,910
I'm Cao Hui, a female coroner of Shiyang.

785
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,160
I'm going to examine the body.

786
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,430
[Cao Hui, former female coroner of Shiyang County]

787
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,790
Everybody, back off.

788
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,880
Write this down.

789
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:03,790
What?

790
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,950
Autopsy records.

791
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,480
Autopsy records?

792
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,780
I'll do it.

793
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,700
Examining.

794
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,230
The victim's eyes and mouth are open.

795
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,290
Examining.

796
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,450
The victim's left hand has no injuries.

797
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,470
Examining.

798
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,800
The victim's right hand

799
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,120
has no injuries.

800
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,290
Examining.

801
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,410
The fatal wound

802
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,350
is in the left chest,

803
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,950
with the flesh and skin turned outward.

804
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,010
Judging from the wound,

805
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,540
the victim died

806
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,350
last night at midnight.

807
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,560
Magistrate.

808
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,250
The victim, Dugu Yang,

809
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,710
was suddenly stabbed.

810
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,120
He was caught off guard

811
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,250
and died on the spot.

812
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,370
After the murderer killed him,

813
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,700
he twisted the knife to inflict more pain.

814
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,070
How cruel!

815
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,480
Magistrate,

816
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,100
please arrest the murderer as soon as possible

817
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,910
to seek justice

818
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,170
for my son.

819
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,270
The victim is her son?

820
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,030
Yes.

821
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,140
She's a coroner

822
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,870
from the previous generation.

823
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,130
She was so overwhelmed with grief

824
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,790
that she passed out.

825
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,750
Take her to see a doctor!

826
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,860
What are you waiting for?

827
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,460
Go get help.

828
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,380
Who died?

829
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,950
Coroner Dugu.

830
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,030
Really?

831
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:18,750
Look.

832
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,070
His mother

833
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,270
passed out from crying.

834
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,190
Who else

835
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,500
could the victim be?

836
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,030
Coroner Dugu died?

837
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,790
How is that possible?

838
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,500
He gave me his word.
