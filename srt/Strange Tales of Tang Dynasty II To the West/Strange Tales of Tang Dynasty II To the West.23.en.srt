[Episode 23]

4
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,310
Minister Ma, please wait

5
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,080
Minister Ma,

6
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,030
this is a letter from Commander Lu.

7
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,830
Commander Lu?

8
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,990
Why don't you sit?

9
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,870
This is my home.

10
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,970
You're acting like the host now, aren't you?

11
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,630
A guest should suit the convenience of the host.

12
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,960
If you don't want to sit,

13
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,950
just stand.

14
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,030
I

15
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,090
am not a member of Taiyin Sect.

16
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,870
So I'm not going to bow to you.

17
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,650
I don't understand

18
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,150
what you mean.

19
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,840
Eighteen years ago,

20
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,360
there was a fierce battle.

21
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,400
Blood flowed like a river in the valley,

22
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,070
and corpses were scattered everywhere.

23
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,170
Officers and soldiers

24
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,830
also paid a heavy price

25
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,390
to eliminate Taiyin Sect.

26
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,790
The little girl saved by that giant rhinoceros

27
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,010
originally had a family name of Duan.

28
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,760
Later,

29
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,160
she was adopted by a huntsman surnamed Song

30
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,690
and always lived deep in Mount Taiyin.

31
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,150
But when did she

32
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,960
return to Hanzhou?

33
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,630
And when did she learn

34
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,730
the skill of cloth dyeing?

35
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,510
Can you tell me?

36
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,870
Are you talking about me?

37
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,950
My family name has been Song since I was born.

38
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,350
Why don't you ask me

39
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,070
how I knew about

40
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,950
knocking with two long and three short knocks?

41
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,269
Long Fa is in the dyeing workshop.

42
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,430
Go catch him now!

43
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,110
You saw Long Fa?

44
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,030
No.

45
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,270
But he knocked with two long and three short knocks.

46
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,530
Ami said it was Long Fa.

47
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,850
Cao Shuangli was tricked.

48
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,600
The one who knocks like this is not Long Fa,

49
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,550
but...

50
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,830
Linghu Shuo.

51
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,750
So what?

52
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,450
I have an affair with Linghu Shuo.

53
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,710
I'm not a good woman.

54
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,170
Why are you still here?

55
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,380
It's about to get dark.

56
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,630
There are only the two of us here.

57
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,430
The girl named Yingtao

58
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,450
won't be able to stand it again.

59
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,670
Cao Shuangli

60
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,030
may not be a good person,

61
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,560
but he loved you very much.

62
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,910
He was worried Long Fa would kill you,

63
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,350
so he begged me desperately

64
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,540
to come here to save you.

65
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,350
But what Cao Shuangli didn't know is

66
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,190
Long Fa died long ago.

67
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,750
What?

68
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,710
You don't know Long Fa is dead?

69
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,630
It was just my guess before.

70
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,730
But just now,

71
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,630
some friends of Judicial Adjutant Ma Meng

72
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,790
helped me find

73
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,300
Long Fa's body.

74
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,400
Body?

75
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,790
Do you want to take a look?

76
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,390
Although Xijun has already written

77
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,390
a letter of divorce for you,

78
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,830
currently, you are still

79
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,030
Long Fa's wife.

80
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,820
It's not against the rules

81
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,250
that you go identify the body.

82
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,110
Where is it?

83
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,220
General,

84
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,950
we are going

85
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,670
to the Hanzhou Granary for rescue.

86
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,630
Shouldn't we speed up?

87
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,930
Will speeding up help?

88
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,550
Well,

89
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,560
what do you mean?

90
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,790
How many gold coins did you get by selling the information

91
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,390
that Commander Lu will send troops for rescue?

92
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,590
If Taiyin Sect has received the information,

93
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,050
will they still attack the Hanzhou Granary?

94
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,390
Who...

95
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,710
Who are you?

96
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,320
How dare you slander me!

97
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,030
Commander Lu ordered me to lead the troops.

98
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,510
Guards!

99
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,810
Arrest him!

100
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:13,830
Dismount!

101
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,090
Dismount!

102
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,390
You... You...

103
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,910
You...

104
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,520
I am the chief commander.

105
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,910
Who are you?

106
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,590
Lu Lingfeng, the new sheriff of Yunding County.

107
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,230
So?

108
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,590
You are just a sheriff...

109
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,870
No.

110
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,750
This man has colluded with Taiyin Sect secretly.

111
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,120
He's one of the rebels.

112
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,360
Arrest him now!

113
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,700
General Lu

114
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,550
is the former general of Imperial Guards.

115
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,650
Today, he's going to lead the troops on behalf of me.

116
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,580
You must obey General Lu's orders.

117
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,510
Yes!

118
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,510
Hey, you,

119
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,790
can't you see?

120
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,870
We're all on the same side.

121
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,590
You'd better run away now.

122
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,670
Do you want to die?

123
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,950
He really has uneven shoulders.

124
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,310
He's the one who sold the information.

125
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,110
I'm sure of it.

126
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,180
That day in Tianbao Restaurant,

127
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,630
you were right behind me.

128
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,620
With a fake beard on, you looked quite convincing.

129
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,550
Ma Meng actually didn't recognize you.

130
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,750
Administrator Tian,

131
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,010
you're quite impressive.

132
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,750
I...

133
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,630
It's just a slight error in thought.

134
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,090
A slight error in thought.

135
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,390
You're already an administrator.

136
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,710
I think you earn a huge salary.

137
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,750
Why did you do such a thing?

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,860
It depends on who you're comparing me to.

139
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,830
Compared to those

140
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,720
wealthy gem and spice merchants,

141
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,310
my salary

142
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,210
is just a drop in the ocean.

143
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,560
Every time I saw them treat someone,

144
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,870
they were very generous.

145
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,420
It really made me ashamed.

146
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,460
I also want to buy a big house.

147
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,300
But I don't have enough money.

148
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,100
How dare you make such an excuse!

149
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,390
What a greedy man!

150
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,270
Just let me kill him with my spear!

151
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,230
Don't, don't!

152
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,390
Don't!

153
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,760
According to what you said,

154
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,520
you resent Long Fa

155
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,630
very much.

156
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,830
But when you saw his body just now,

157
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,500
your tears betrayed you.

158
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,590
Tell me.

159
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,710
Why did you lie to me before?

160
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,150
Actually, Long Fa

161
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,110
treated me very well.

162
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,510
Sir.

163
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,220
Back then,

164
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,700
my adoptive father was injured by a wild beast.

165
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,270
He was on his deathbed.

166
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,590
And I didn't know how to hunt.

167
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,870
I wouldn't be able to survive

168
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,780
if I still lived in the mountain.

169
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,270
Long Fa came with many betrothal gifts

170
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,470
to propose marriage.

171
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,000
So I agreed.

172
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,970
I didn't know he was a successful merchant

173
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,170
until we got married.

174
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,630
After we got married,

175
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,590
he asked me to keep

176
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,440
all the title deeds.

177
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,970
He also gave me all the money

178
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,830
earned from doing business.

179
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,160
Long Fa was born in a poor family.

180
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,670
He started from scratch.

181
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,490
Because of his diligence and frugality,

182
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,200
his business became bigger and bigger.

183
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,470
Yes.

184
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,880
He was a rare kind-hearted person.

185
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,990
But later,

186
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,500
he changed.

187
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,710
He changed later?

188
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,780
He changed after Linghu Shuo

189
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,230
appeared, right?

190
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,580
After that,

191
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,730
he often came to buy cloth.

192
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,270
No matter how many pieces of cloth I dyed,

193
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,600
he would buy all of them.

194
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,670
He would never bargain.

195
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,430
One day,

196
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,230
I asked him.

197
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,110
Mr. Linghu,

198
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,590
why do you want to buy so many pieces of cloth?

199
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,030
What I want to buy is not cloth,

200
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,830
but...

201
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,440
everything you've invested in the cloth.

202
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,720
Sir, please say no more.

203
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,190
It would be terrible

204
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,870
if my husband hears this.

205
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,590
You mean Long Fa,

206
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,550
Mr. Long, right?

207
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,840
Now, he is in Jiufang Pavilion.

208
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,910
He is in Pleasure House,

209
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,870
enjoying everything of other women.

210
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,470
Nonsense!

211
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,390
He would never go to that kind of place.

212
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,590
You don't believe me.

213
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,360
Let me take you there to have a look.

214
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,470
Here.

215
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,270
Drink more.

216
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,560
Good.

217
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,510
Come on.

218
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,010
Come and catch me. Come on.

219
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,230
At that time, all I wanted to do

220
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,870
was jumping into the dye vat

221
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,590
to drown myself.

222
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,360
Jiufang Pavilion

223
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,350
is a property of the Linghu family.

224
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,020
Linghu Shuo took Long Fa

225
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,740
to Pleasure House

226
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,920
and Wanli Gambling House.

227
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,550
But they didn't know each other before.

228
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,590
Do you know

229
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,460
Linghu Shuo made great efforts

230
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,030
to befriend Long Fa?

231
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,230
He bought the cloth you dyed.

232
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,200
He was also the biggest buyer

233
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,110
of Long Fa's fur products.

234
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,550
What?

235
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,390
Linghu Shuo did this

236
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,470
because of

237
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,150
your special identity.

238
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,470
My identity?

239
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,670
That's right.

240
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,590
But at that time,

241
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,030
I didn't know.

242
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,370
I guess

243
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,950
Linghu Shuo is definitely not the first person

244
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,550
who found out your identity.

245
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,420
Because

246
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,070
he's too young.

247
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,880
[Long's Residence]

248
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,300
It's really you.

249
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,500
Ami.

250
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,470
Young Sect Leader,

251
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,230
I finally found you.

252
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,609
Young Sect Leader.

253
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,550
Master, get up.

254
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,890
I am not your young sect leader.

255
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,490
The sect leader said long ago

256
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,110
as long as his descendants are alive,

257
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,710
the eldest shall be the leader of Taiyin Sect.

258
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,750
If there are no male heirs,

259
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,750
a female can also take the position.

260
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,310
I

261
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,050
am the chief commander of Taiyin Sect,

262
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,430
but it took me 18 years to find you.

263
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,590
I deserve to die.

264
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,310
Please allow me to redeem myself.

265
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,120
Now, please go back to Mount Taiyin

266
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,330
to preside over the overall situation.

267
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,900
Master, get up.

268
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,760
I don't want to be the sect leader.

269
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
You don't want to?

270
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,490
Have you forgotten

271
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,050
the bodies of our sect members were scattered everywhere?

272
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,300
Have you forgotten

273
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,870
your father,

274
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,590
your mother,

275
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,790
and your elder brothers

276
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,880
all died because of the court of Tang?

277
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,210
I don't want to hear this! Get out!

278
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,950
Sect Leader,

279
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,910
are you coming with me or not?

280
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,740
No.

281
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,590
Master!

282
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,100
I can summon the spirit

283
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,420
of Sect Leader Duan Gui

284
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,890
by breaking my right arm.

285
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,550
Duan Ami,

286
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,590
you refuse to admit the sect leader is your father.

287
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,870
How can you face your ancestors?

288
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,280
Although he threatened me with his life,

289
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,120
I still refused.

290
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,410
Because I wanted to live a peaceful life.

291
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,590
I just wanted to live well.

292
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,950
So it's Master Wu Liang

293
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,230
from Hui'an Temple.

294
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,990
I heard

295
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,750
he is almost 100 years old.

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,380
[Cultivating Diligently]

297
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,990
Who is so bold?

298
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,490
You even dare to rob a temple.

299
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,640
Do you dare to let me see your face?

300
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,780
Sure.

301
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,870
Governor Liao.

302
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,850
Governor Liao,

303
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,990
I can't believe you've practiced martial arts.

304
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,670
I can also kill people.

305
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,590
I've been in Hanzhou for six years.

306
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,220
I prayed to Buddha every three days.

307
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,660
I've been to Hui'an Temple many times.

308
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,150
But you just wouldn't let me see

309
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,010
the tongue relic of Master Moshi.

310
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,140
No wonder you withdrew your troops.

311
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,590
You're worried they'll see you robbing the temple

312
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,240
with a broadsword if there are too many people here.

313
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,270
Cut the crap!

314
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,750
I've searched everywhere in Hui'an Temple.

315
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,540
I'm sure

316
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,080
the relic

317
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,870
is right here in your meditation abode.

318
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,800
Give it to me!

319
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,970
Governor Liao,

320
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,560
you'd better be careful.

321
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,150
If you really kill me,

322
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,680
you can never see

323
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,790
the relic.

324
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,920
Master.

325
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,390
I...

326
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,870
finally saw you.

327
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,550
Please let me

328
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,630
serve you for the rest of my life.

329
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,950
If they know what you did today,

330
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,130
I'm afraid you'll lose your title and fame.

331
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,110
Compared to Master's relic,

332
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,920
my title and fame are nothing important.

333
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,390
Everyone knows

334
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,030
the tongue relic

335
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,830
is the biggest treasure of Hui'an Temple in Hanzhou.

336
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,860
If you take it,

337
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,960
where will you put it to worship it?

338
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,390
I will take Master

339
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,210
to a place untouched by human presence

340
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,630
and untainted by the impurities of the world.

341
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,810
This place is untouched by human presence

342
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,340
and untainted by the impurities of the world!

343
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,070
You old monk,

344
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,430
either you go away

345
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,360
or you help me remove its cover.

346
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,750
Okay.

347
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,100
I'll help you.

348
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,130
Your arm...

349
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,270
You always said

00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,270
Taiyin Sect

351
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,230
will steal the relic, right?

352
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,310
Look at my broken arm.

353
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,470
Does it remind you of anyone?

354
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,150
Duan Gui.

355
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,230
You are Duan Gui.

356
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,680
Impossible.

357
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,720
He died long ago.

358
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,930
Of course I'm not the sect leader.

359
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,750
But I broke my right arm

360
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,470
as a vow to follow the sect leader forever.

361
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,030
Of course we won't exchange the relic

362
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,510
for gold or silver to make weapons.

363
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,950
After we take Hanzhou City tonight,

364
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,550
this

365
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,090
will be the city's treasure.

366
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,300
It will bless Taiyin Sect

367
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,720
and make us invincible.

368
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,250
You rebel!

369
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,030
Your ribs are broken.

370
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,260
You can't get up.

371
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,370
Just stay here

372
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,840
and serve Master Moshi.

373
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,630
Linghu Shuo really made great efforts.

374
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,040
First, he seduced you.

375
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,320
Then he deliberately

376
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,190
spread this news.

377
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,230
He also made Long Fa pick up bad habits.

378
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,390
This caused Long Fa's temperament to change greatly.

379
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,790
So he often beat and abused you.

380
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,230

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,170
how Linghu Shuo

382
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,230
lured Long Fa into gambling

383
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,670
and set a trap to make him

384
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,910
lose his everything,

385
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,150
I guess I don't need

386
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,450
to tell you these details.

387
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,180
Actually,

388
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,710
I've guessed it all.

389
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,630
But I don't regret it.

390

what Linghu Shuo gave me.

394
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,590
So you completely submitted

395
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,390
to Linghu Shuo

396
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,350
and even went to Liaoshi Hall

397
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,570
to hire an assassin

398
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,190
in an attempt to kill Long Fa.

399
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,870
But what you don't know is

400
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,030
Linghu Shuo also wanted to kill him long ago.

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,360
When I found Long Fa's body,

403
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,090
I performed an autopsy.

404
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,350
He died from

405

a dent at the back of his skull

406
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,070
due to a severe blow.

407
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,940
The reason for his death

408
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,870
is exactly the same as that for the death of Cao Shuangli

409
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,020
and the assassin you hired.

410
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,250
As for the assassin,

411
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,830
after he snuck into your residence, he

412
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,290
ran into Linghu Shuo, who was looking for you.

413
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,690
He was unexpectedly killed by Linghu Shuo.

423
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,080
Because the god in my heart

to admit you are a descendant of Duan Gui.

434
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,070
Linghu Shuo took great pains.

00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,110
Right now,

568
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,910
you are like a lunatic.

569
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,990
Do you really think

570
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,990
your Taiyin Sect

571
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,510
can succeed tonight?

572
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,620
Come.

573
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,280
I'll take you to have a look.

574
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,880
Look.

575
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,740
All these people died because of you.

576
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,390
You old man,

577
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,660
surrender now!

578
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,030
I fell into your trap today,

579
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,190
but our troops

580
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,110
in Mount Taiyin

581
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,050
will definitely capture Hanzhou City today.

582
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,150
Those who don't want to die,

583
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,010
drop your weapons and surrender!

584
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,590
Soldiers,

585
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,470
clean up the battlefield

586
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,710
and clear the bodies.

587
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,230
-Kill!
-Kill!

588
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:22,300
-Kill!
-Kill!

589
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:29,460
-Kill!
-Kill!

590
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,230
Commander,

591
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,670
the rebels have reached the city gate.

592
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,470
Line up to confront the enemies!

593
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,030
What...

594
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,470
What monster is this?

595
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,090
It's the Mountain God!

596
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,710
The Tongtian rhino!

597
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,710
I can't believe there is such a thing in this world.

598
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,030
Hanzhou is in danger!

599
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,040
Don't disrupt the army's morale.

600
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,400
It's just a rhinoceros.

601
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,580
What's there to be afraid of?

602
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,810
Wait!

603
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:09,840
Yingtao,

604
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,520
this creature is very big.

605
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,680
If we can't kill it with one strike,

606
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,810
we'll only anger it.

607
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,670
The commander ordered me

608
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,020
to guard the gate tower.

609
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,070
Without my order,

610
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,450
no one is allowed to release arrows!

611
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,110
-Yes!
-Yes!

612
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,230
Hurry.

613
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,190
Keep up.

614
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,180
Make way!

615
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,550
Just scatter them here.

616
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,610
Scatter them here.

617
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,030
Hurry.

618
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,070
Brother.

619
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,630
Brother.

620
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,840
The people of Hanzhou are so kind.

621
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,670
After knowing we're going to deal with the rebels of Taiyin Sect,

622
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,500
the owners of the drug shops

623
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,400
were generous.

624
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,790
Yes. Look.

625
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,470
The herb formation has already been built.

626
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,860
As long as the monster is a rhinoceros,

627
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,830
it will become dizzy and disoriented

628
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,030
after we ignite the herbs.

629
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,150
Then it'll be very easy

630
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,270
to kill it.

631
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,150
Be careful.

632
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,990
Come on.

633
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,350
Soldiers of Hanzhou!

634
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,370
-Yes!
-Yes!

635
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,880
If a ferocious beast enters the city,

636
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,150
what should we do?

637
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,310
Kill it!

638
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,670
We swear to protect the people of Hanzhou with our lives!

639
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,000
We swear to protect the people of Hanzhou with our lives!

640
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,340
We swear to protect the people of Hanzhou with our lives!
