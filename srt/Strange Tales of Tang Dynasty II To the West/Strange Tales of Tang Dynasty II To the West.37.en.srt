00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,390
Why did this happen?

12
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,460
My Lord, you're finally back.

13
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,150
Bao is dead.

14
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,470
My son.

15
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,910
He's dead!

16
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,750
What's going on here?

17
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,270
Wait.

18
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,150
Please help Mr. and Mrs. Cao

19
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,300
to the side.

20
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,670
Mr. Cao.

21
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,450
What...

22
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,660
What's going on here?

23
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,210
He was like this when we found him.

24
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,130
We didn't dare to move him,

25
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,250
so we just found a white cloth to cover him with.

26
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,550
The monstrous face drawn on this handkerchief

27
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,230
doesn't look like Fang Xiang God either.

28
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,750
This is definitely not Fang Xiang God.

29
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,350
Fang Xiang God has four eyes.

30
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,670
This two-eyed one should be Qi Tou.

31
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,829
What is Qi Tou?

32
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,660
According to the funeral customs of Tang,

33
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,710
after a person dies, the family members need to climb onto the roof

34
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,130
and call out the name of the deceased

35
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,360
to summon the soul.

36
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,910
After that, they cut the back of the deceased's clothes

37
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,390
to keep it as a memento.

38
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,590
After that,

39
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,350
the body can be bathed, dressed in clean clothes,

40
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,980
and placed on the bier.

41
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,750
Finally, it is covered with ying cloth.

42
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,510
The so-called ying cloth

43
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,950
is also known as

44
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,300
ghost clothes.

45
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,030
The image drawn on this cloth

46
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,050
is Qi Tou.

47
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,510
According to legends,

48
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,190
it collects the souls of the deceased.

49
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,470
Who...

50
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,580
Who killed my son?

51
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,880
Who was the first to discover the body?

52
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,750
It was...

53
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,390
It was me.

54
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,310
I was calling for Uncle at the door today

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,230
because Uncle and I had agreed

56
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,120
to go sand sliding outside the city.

57
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,260
Uncle!

58
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,630
Uncle!

59
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,330
When are we leaving?

60
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,310
Uncle!

61
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,430
Saisai,

62
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,510
your uncle probably isn't up yet.

63
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,830
No way.

64
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,470
Uncle Duobao never sleeps in.

65
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,070
Uncle!

66
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,910
Uncle?

67
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,630
Someone come!

68
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,430
Uncle.

69
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,040
Duobao?

70
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,470
My name is Duobao.

71
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,780
If you need anything after entering the city,

72
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,860
you can come to me.

73
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,060
Just ask any kid

74
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,630
to find Duobao, the one who

75
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,190
talks about Dunhuang the best,

76
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,560
and you'll be able to find me.

77
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,510
It really is him.

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,560
How do you know

79
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,350
my son?

80
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,040
When passing by the Mogao Caves,

81
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,610
we had the fortune of meeting him.

82
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,450
He was an honest, intelligent and good youth.

83
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,260
I originally thought he was just

84
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,720
a child from a poor family.

85
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,470
I never expected him to be Mr. Cao's son.

86
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,790
I was originally planning to

87
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,510
look for him after entering the city

88
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,150
and have him take me to tour the Mogao Caves again.

89
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,010
I can't believe

90
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,150
he was met with such misfortune.

91
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,600
Duobao loved to read

92
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,110
and had a passion for Dunhuang's present and past.

93
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,970
Don't say more.

94
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,930
Being born into the Cao family,

95
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,130
he should've learned

96
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,800
to manage the family business since childhood.

97
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,510
But instead,

98
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,470
he just wanted to become

99
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,870
a broker who explained the local scenery.

100
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,000
He disgraced the Cao family.

101
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,260
The child is gone.

102
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,150
Why are you saying this now?

103
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,870
Yes, Father-in-law.

104
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,750
Please don't be anxious.

105
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,140
Don't call me that.

106
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,840
You're about the same age as me.

107
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,800
Didn't you deceive my daughter

108
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,550
just for my money?

109
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,510
I...

110
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,830
Rong and I

111
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,390
fell in love at first sight.

112
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,190
Stop talking.

113
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,590
Father.

114
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,870
Fan Songling and I

115
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,190
are already married.

116
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,100
There's nothing shameful about it.

117
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,670
An old husband with a young wife

118
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,950
is a common thing.

119
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,350
Isn't she

120
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,720
also around 20 years younger than you?

121
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,850
Besides,

122
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,110
if Fan Songling doesn't call you Father-in-law,

123
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,710
then what should he call you?

124
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,690
Don't tell me

125
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,350
he should call you Cao.

126
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,160
If you think it's proper,

127
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,270
I'll have him call you that.

128
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,230
Bastard!

129
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,790
Mr. Cao, calm down.

130
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,190
You want to hit me?

131
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,810
Come here.

132
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,690
You might as well beat me to death,

133
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,090
so I won't get a share of the family fortune.

134
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,590
Give it all to that Ye Lai.

135
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,560
Too bad her son died.

136
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,909
What you give her won't stay in the Cao family either.

137
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,870
Cao Rong,

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll fight you to the end!

139
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,630
Mother.

140
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,430
Stop them.

141
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,350
Stop fighting, stop fighting.

142
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,950
Stop!

143
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,420
If you want to fight, go outside.

144
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,570
We're examining the corpse here.

145
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,560
Who are you people?

146
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,780
I am Lu Lingfeng, the Sheriff of Yunding County.

147
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,070
I came to Shazhou for official business.

148
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,830
Then what authority do you have

149
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,090
to investigate a murder case in Shazhou?

150
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,760
My husband Li Chi is a judicial adjutant.

151
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,390
Why don't I see him?

152
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,040
You shut up.

153
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,880
How dare you mention him?

154
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,890
Are you coroners?

155
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,430
You're just pretending.

156
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,470
Do you even know how to examine a corpse?

157
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,270
Bastard.

158
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,309
Mr. Su is a disciple of Detective Di.

159
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,539
Detective Di?

160
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,669
Who is Detective Di?

161
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,750
Detective Di is Di Renjie.

162
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,770
You don't even know that?

163
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,910
Why are you glaring at me?

164
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,510
I don't know who Di Renjie is.

165
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,140
You bastards,

166
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,550
get out!

167
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,010
Sorry for the trouble.

168
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,250
Yingtao, write this down.

169
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,900
His lips are purplish.

170
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,870
There are blood traces in the mouth and nose,

171
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,180
and strangulation marks on the neck.

172
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,780
The preliminary judgment is

173
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,510
that the cause of death was asphyxiation.

174
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,990
Father.

175
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,790
Take off that silk scarf.

176
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,700
Take it off.

177
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,190
Is the wound deep?

178
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,360
It's not serious.

179
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,790
Father,

180
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,010
I lied

181
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,910
to you yesterday.

182
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,150
I know.

183
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,970
He was in the room at that time,

184
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,080
holding a machete.

185
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,470
Were you afraid that he would hurt me?

186
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,200
Li Chi

187
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,630
was out of his mind and acted against the law of nature.

188
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,210
But

189
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,430
for the sake of him

190
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,760
being your son-in-law,

191
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,750
please forgive him.

192
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,090
I am just a merchant.

193
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,510
This case is under

194
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,190
the jurisdiction of the government office.

195
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,510
What I say won't count.

196
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,350
Come,

197
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,310
get up.

198
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,270
You are my firstborn child.

199
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,200
If you were involved in the plot against me

200
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,140
my heart would truly be broken.

201
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,990
What a good child.

202
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,030
I really feel sorry for Mr. Cao.

203
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,320
Yesterday,

204
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,990
we should've asked him

205
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,390
to keep accompanying us.

206
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,350
Perhaps

207
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,380
this wouldn't have happened.

208
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,550
Master.

209
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,350
Wrap it up.

210
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:22,870
Yes.

211
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,330
[Wealthy and Successful]

212
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,390
To tell you the truth,

213
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,030
Li Chi and Ding Mao

214
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,290
are already in prison.

215
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,630
Grandfather,

216
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,950
why is my father in prison?

217
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,670
Taking advantage of the dark night,

218
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,800
he tried killing me.

219
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,010
Doesn't he deserve to be imprisoned?

220
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,260
Mother,

221
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,730
why did Father want to kill Grandfather?

222
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,710
I can't believe Li Chi would do such a thing.

223
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,110
It's really despicable.

224
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,710
Why was Ding Mao also arrested?

225
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,040
Now that things have come to this,

226
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,640
there's no need to hide it anymore.

227
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,650
I have

228
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,230
written my will long ago.

229
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,910
I originally planned to tell you all today.

230
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,570
But unexpectedly,

231
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,550
Li Chi colluded with Ding Mao

232
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,110
and found out in advance

233
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,230
the will's contents about distributing the inheritance.

234
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,560
That's why they wanted to assassinate me.

235
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,660
Li Chi is such a bastard.

236
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,690
And to think he's an official!

237
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,010
He's truly a hypocrite

238
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,210
with cruel ambition.

239
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,670
Father,

240
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,480
about the contents of the will...

241
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,230
You want to know too?

242
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,430
It seems you all want to know.

243
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,380
Saisai.

244
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,510
Read it out for everyone to hear.

245
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,910
I have

246
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,260
three daughters and one son.

247
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,150
When I pass away at the age of 60

248
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,980
and am buried in the cave,

249
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,710
all my assets will be left

250
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,150
to my descendants.

251
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,790
Duobao shall inherit the family property

252
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,600
and receive 50 percent.

253
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,270
Yelai shall receive 10 percent,

254
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,030
Yin's family shall receive 10 percent,

255
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,870
and Rong's family shall receive 10 percent.

256
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,870
Xiao is unmarried and shall receive 20 percent.

257
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,470
Testator,

258
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,910
Cao Zhongda.

259
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,620
Do you think

260
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,510
my distribution is fair?

261
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,240
It's not fair.

262
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,750
I am the eldest daughter

263
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,950
and I married a live-in son-in-law.

264
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,480
Why do I only get 10 percent?

265
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,390
Sister,

266
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,050
what do you mean by that?

267
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,700
Do you think I got too much,

268
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,210
or that you got too little?

269
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,260
Although I am married,

270
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,670
I stayed with the Cao family.

271
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,810
But you married out.

272
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,030
Shouldn't there be a difference?

273
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,540
You...

274
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,330
But why don't you think about

275
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,570
what Li Chi has done?

276
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,750
Li Chi hadn't done anything

277
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,280
when Father wrote his will.

278
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,270
It was this will that forced him to do those things.

279
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,720
Why are you so angry?

280
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,020
I just want justice.

281
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,230
Li Chi is an official,

282
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,170
yet he was willing to marry into a merchant family.

283
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,550
You shouldn't treat him like this.

284
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,590
Your husband is now a prisoner,

285
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,190
and you're still fighting for him here?

286
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,850
I married on Father's orders,

287
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,840
and Li Chi

288
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,810
was also approved by Father

289
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,210
as a live-in son-in-law.

290
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,350
Unlike you.

291
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:22,910
You—

292
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,070
Why don't you defend me?

293
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,690
Money is a material possession.

294
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,620
You're just a good-for-nothing.

295
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,420
Father,

296
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,920
since you

297
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,110
had me marry a live-in son-in-law back then,

298
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,240
you should have treated him like a son.

299
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,190
But now,

300
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,950
Duobao gets 50 percent,

301
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,830
while my whole family only gets 10 percent.

302
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,560
Is that fair?

303
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,740
Saisai's surname is Cao,

304
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,430
yet she's not even mentioned in the will.

305
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,230
Is that fair?

306
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,870
I’m the eldest daughter,

307
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,370
but I'm don't even get as much as Cao Xiao.

308
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,310
Is that fair?

309
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,150
Stop arguing.

310
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,350
Duobao is dead

311
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,350
and Father is leaving today too.

312
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,470
If Duobao could live

313
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,790
and Father wouldn't need to leave,

314
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,350
I could give you

315
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,470
my 20 percent.

316
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,570
Xiao,

317
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,510
you're my only concern.

318
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,990
Anyone can say nice words.

319
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,950
Exactly.

320
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,750
I, Cao Yin,

321
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
am the only one speaking sincerely.

322
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,880
What do you mean?

323
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,970
How could so much

324
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,480
happen overnight?

325
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,670
The judicial adjutant turned into an assassin

326
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,270
and now there's been another murder case.

327
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,830
The city's Administrator position is vacant

328
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,380
and the Military Commander is not here either.

329
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,110
I...I don't know how to investigate cases.

330
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,750
What should I do?

331
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,240
I am of little talent,

332
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,440
but I am willing to take on the task of investigating this case.

333
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,900
But the delegation of Kang

334
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,630
will be arriving in a few days.

335
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,110
After they arrive in Shazhou,

336
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,770
you will have to set off back to the capital immediately.

337
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,720
I shall solve the case

338
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,800
before the delegation arrives.

339
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,280
That would be great.

340
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,710
That would be great.

341
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,430
However,

342
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,750
I have a request.

343
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,020
Let Su Wuming and I

344
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,190
investigate this case together.

345
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,790
I know

346
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,910
Mr. Su

347
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,590
is now a commoner.

348
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,670
But after all, he was once

349
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,910
the Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

350
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,710
Now Shazhou

351
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,990
is in need of talents.

352
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,030
If Mr. Su could assist Sheriff Lu

353
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,069
in solving this case,

354
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,829
I would be more than happy.

355
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,470
Then please have the prefectural governor send someone

356
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,660
to move the body to Qiande Hall.

357
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,230
The postmortem

358
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,530
has not been fully completed yet.

359
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,109
That's easy to arrange.

360
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,840
I will give the order right now.

361
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,870
Solving this case before the delegation of Kang

362
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,020
arrives in Shazhou?

363
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,120
You're this confident?

364
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,520
This case is not difficult.

365
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,710
The murderer must be someone from the Cao family.

366
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,350
Are you this unconfident?

367
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,790
You've drawn this conclusion

368
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,310
too hastily.

369
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,260
If the murderer was an outsider,

370
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,270
they usually wouldn't consider

371
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,550
what the victim's ghost

372
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,670
might do to them.

373
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,830
Only someone close to the victim

374
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,510
would worry about the ghost coming back for revenge

375
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,170
after committing the murder.

376
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,510
That's why they covered Duobao's face

377
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,840
with that piece of cloth

378
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,390
to cover the so-called ghost.

379
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,150
Good analysis.

380
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,100
Cao Zhongda is the richest man in Shazhou.

381
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,680
His family all know

382
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,950
he will have his 60th birthday funeral.

383
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,740
And Duobao,

384
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,160
as his only son,

385
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,120
would inherit most of the family fortune.

386
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,050
Now that Duobao has suddenly died,

387
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,400
who would benefit from it?

388
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,430
In my opinion,

389
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,910
all three Cao sisters are suspects.

390
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,800
There aren't many clues in this case,

391
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,340
but there are quite a few people with motives.

392
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,320
We need to question them one by one.

393
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,390
Also,

394
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,610
we need to do a further postmortem.

395
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,880
Then let's split up.

396
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,970
I'll do the questioning

397
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,430
and you do the postmortem.

398
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,070
You don't think that

399
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,590
I killed Duobao, do you?

400
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,270
Don't you have

401
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,430
a motive for killing Duobao?

402
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,590
Of course not.

403
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,430
After you learned the details of Mr. Cao's will,

404
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,710
you developed a murderous intent.

405
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,760
It was just to get

406
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,310
a larger share of the family fortune.

407
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,370
Killing Mr. Cao and altering the will

408
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,430
was probably your plan, right?

409
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,590
It's easy to get caught for altering the will,

410
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,390
and it takes guts to kill Mr. Cao,

411
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,830
but killing a child

412
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,010
is much easier.

413
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,750
With Duobao dead,

414
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,390
you're the eldest son-in-law and the live-in son-in-law,

415
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,320
plus Saisai has the surname of Cao,

416
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,350
so you would get a larger share of the family property.

417
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,710
Are you acquiescing?

418
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,110
It's really my bad luck to run into you.

419
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,870
Yes,

420
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,720
I did plan to kill Cao Zhongda

421
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,510
and alter the will with Butler Ding,

422
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,070
but

423
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,310
didn't I fail

424
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,510
and get caught by you?

425
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,130
Sheriff Lu,

426
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,550
Duobao

427
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,830
was a good kid.

428
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,740
He didn't like doing business,

429
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,620
but if he could have grown up,

430
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,150
he would have achieved great things.

431
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,840
You must catch the murderer.

432
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,170
Are you removing yourself from this?

433
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,580
You left the banquet

434
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,820
early yesterday,

435
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,090
while Duobao died around 9 to 11 p.m.

436
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,470
You had plenty of time to commit the crime.

437
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,820
After I left Qiande Hall yesterday,

438
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,910
I went straight home.

439
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,660
I fell asleep immediately

440
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,190
and slept until about 4 a.m.

441
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,600
If you don't believe me,

442
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,950
you can go ask Yin.

443
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,870
After Li Chi returned from Qiande Hall,

444
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,380
he went to bed without saying a word.

445
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,550
I knew he had something on his mind,

446
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,510
so I thought I would put the child to sleep first

447
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,770
and then listen to him pour his heart out,

448
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,070
but by the time Saisai was fast asleep,

449
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,130
he was already snoring like thunder.

450
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,150
Did you know he went out in the middle of the night?

451
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,470
Yes.

452
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,300
When did he wake up?

453
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,590
At 4 a.m.

454
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,600
Are you sure?

455
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,390
I'm sure.

456
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,820
Father is about to have his 60th birthday funeral.

457
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,400
I couldn't fall asleep.

458
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,640
Unfair.

459
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,960
Only giving 10 percent.

460
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,350
Being a live-in son-in-law for nothing.

461
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,630
It's not fair.

462
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,820
What's wrong?

463
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,160
Did you drink too much?

464
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,700
I made some sobering soup.

465
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,870
Let me get you a bowl.

466
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,660
When I returned with the soup,

467
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,110
he was already gone.

468
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,190
That's it.

469
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,950
What?

470
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,670
You don't believe what I said?

471
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,100
Then you can go ask Saisai.

472
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,630
Children don't lie.

473
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,570
When my dad came back,

474
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,510
he was already drunk.

475
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,310
He went straight to bed.

476
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,560
He didn't even pay attention to me.

477
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,540
Later, my mom helped me wash up

478
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,910
and put me to bed.

479
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,630
My father would never kill

480
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,510
Uncle Duobao.

481
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,110
My father really likes Uncle.

482
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,880
It's true.

483
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,550
Don't cry.

484
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,210
We are just asking you.

485
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,190
We didn't say who the murderer was.

486
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,910
Cao Saisai,

487
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,790
you were the first one

488
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,520
to discover your uncle's body.

489
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,830
So could you please

490
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,760
tell me in detail

491
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,550
what happened this morning?

492
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,950
I first

493
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,310
called for Uncle

494
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,670
at the door.

495
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,470
Uncle!

496
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,110
Uncle!

497
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,440
Uncle.

498
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,510
Help! Someone!

499
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,390
Quick, someone come!

500
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,950
Uncle!

501
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,950
Oh no!

502
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,930
Duobao has been strangled to death!

503
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,070
Duobao has been strangled to death!

504
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,990
Uncle Fan went to the courtyard again

505
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,350
and shouted for a while.

506
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,030
My mother,

507
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,800
Aunt Rong,

508
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,490
and Aunt Xiao

509
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,320
all came over.

510
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,110
The Uncle Fan you mentioned

511
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,440
is Fan Songling, right?

512
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,460
He was dancing

513
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,100
in the courtyard early in the morning?

514
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,710
Yes.

515
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,510
He just loves to dance.

516
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,840
He dances every day.

517
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,990
That old man is so weird.

518
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,750
Just looking at him makes people dislike him.

519
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,300
Xue Huan.

520
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,610
At that time, Fan Songling said

521
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,370
Duobao was strangled to death?

522
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,150
Yes.

523
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,110
Did he

524
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,640
carefully examine the body

525
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,190
and uncover

526
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,390
the ying cloth covering Duobao's face?

527
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,320
No.

528
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,560
What is Uncle Fan's job?

529
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,630
He was the chief architect that Grandfather hired

530
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,880
when building the Cao Family Cave.

531
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,520
What does a chief architect do?

532
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,790
They're in charge of the overall design

533
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,030
and construction of the cave.

534
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,630
All levels

535
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,270
of workers

536
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,510
are under his management.

537
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,440
The chief architect has full authority over the construction.

538
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:20,950
Yes.

539
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,820
You know so much.

540
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,720
Aunt Rong is a dummy.

541
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,510
She doesn't even know who Di Renjie is,

542
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,870
but I do.

543
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,710
My mother said

544
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,340
Detective Di was excellent.

545
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,340
His disciples must not be easy to deal with.

546
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,670
Sheriff Lu, you're capable.

547
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,380
You must avenge

548
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,340
my Uncle Duobao!

549
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,430
Don't worry, Saisai.

550
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,550
Sheriff Lu

551
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,270
will definitely not let

552
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,870
Duobao's murderer get away.

553
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,480
I will

554
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,310
also need Saisai's help.

555
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,720
Do you have any other clues?

556
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,870
Uncle

557
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,160
didn't like money,

558
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,320
didn't want the family property,

559
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,390
and wanted to be a merchant even less.

560
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,030
He only wanted to explain about Dunhuang

561
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,870
to foreign travelers.

562
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,710
He knew so much.

563
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,280
He made up many stories

564
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,900
and wrote them all down in a red-covered book.

565
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,170
Oh, right.

566
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,470
I just went to Uncle's room

567
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,620
to look for that book

568
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,820
but couldn't find it.

569
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,330
Why were you looking for the book?

570
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,310
I want to memorize everything

571
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,300
in the book.

572
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,440
In the future,

573
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,470
I want to be like Uncle

574
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,870
and become the best broker in Dunhuang.

575
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,910
What are you reading?

576
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,000
This is a book written by Duobao.

577
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,060
It records Dunhuang's history,

578
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,960
religion,

579
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,070
scenery,

580
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,710
and cuisine.

581
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,150
Such a young child could write a book?

582
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,990
Of course,

583
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,910
it's still different from books

584
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,370
in the traditional sense,

585
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,350
but the content is rich.

586
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,070
Between the lines, you can see

587
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,130
Duobao's intelligence,

588
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,950
innocence,

589
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,150
and love for his hometown.

590
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,270
No matter how good it is, you can't keep reading it.

591
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,510
Someone is examining the body.

592
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:38,990
Her?

593
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,350
Su Wuming,

594
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,410
come here quickly!

595
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:56,870
Fed,

596
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,610
what do you think about this new disciple

597
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,410
I just took in?

598
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,600
When did you get this disciple?

599
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,740
Hurry and take a look.

600
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,980
What is this?

601
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,670
It seems to be

602
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,070
lip balm.

603
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,430
Back in Chang'an,

604
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,580
lip balm was found behind the ears

605
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,390
of Chief Musician Sun Wang.

606
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,830
That's not right.

607
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,350
This Duobao is a child.

608
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,400
How could he be involved with courtesans?

609
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,670
Why does this color look

610
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,830
so familiar?

611
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,100
It's from the drawing in the cave of...

612
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,720
-Fan Songling?
-Fan Songling?

613
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,490
What are the postmortem results?

614
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,690
There are indeed new discoveries.

615
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,150
We found a

616
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,910
key clue

617
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,750
on the second son-in-law of the Cao family,

618
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,660
Fan Songling.

619
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,630
We also got Fan Songling here.

620
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,590
I'll go bring that old thing over

621
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,510
and interrogate him.

622
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,310
Wait a moment.

623
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,110
Have all the people from the Cao family been questioned?

624
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,670
Not yet.

625
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,630
The more pressing the time is,

626
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,750
the more we need to keep our composure.

627
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,230
That makes sense.

628
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,980
When it's time for interrogation,

629
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,240
we'll interrogate him until everything is crystal clear.

630
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,670
Have you found the murderer

631
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,550
who killed my son?

632
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,950
Mr. Cao,

633
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,590
we already have some clues.

634
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,430
Fed.

635
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,100
Mr. Su,

636
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,680
you must not

637
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,970
keep anything from me.

638
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,950
Tell me.

639
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,830
I only have this one son.

640
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,750
And after tonight,

641
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,070
I won't have the chance

642
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,470
to avenge my son anymore.

643
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,240
You have to tell me

644
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,790
who the murderer is.

645
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,710
Mr. Cao,

646
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,330
I am in charge of this case.

647
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,070
Although we have some clues,

648
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,920
the murderer has not been confirmed yet.

649
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,380
I hope you can understand.

650
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,230
Fine.

651
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,870
Well, if that's the case,

652
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,070
return my son's body to me.

653
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,610
I'm about to die.

654
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,230
Tonight,

655
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,350
just let me carry my son on my back

656
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,550
into the Cao Family Cave.

657
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,400
Mr. Cao.

658
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,660
If we want to find out the real murderer,

659
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,720
we still need to examine the body. So,

660
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,910
you cannot take away

661
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,960
your child's body.

662
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,270
My son,

663
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,470
I have let you down.

664
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,680
You're running

665
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,910
the Cao family's pawnshop at such a young age.

666
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,240
Mr. Cao trusts you a lot.

667
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,850
My father had no choice.

668
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,060
Duobao was still young

669
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,310
and he didn't like doing business.

670
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,070
The pawnshop could only be handed over to me.

671
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,400
What do these questions

672
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,760
have to do with the death

673
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,710
of my brother?

674
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,170
Sheriff Lu

675
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,890
just wanted to help you relax.

676
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,250
I'm not nervous at all.

677
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,350
Well then, besides making money

678
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,830
for the Cao family by running the pawnshop,

679
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,670
you must have made quite a lot for yourself too, right?

680
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,070
I put in a lot of hard work,

681
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,010
so I naturally earn a bit more.

682
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,510
But earning more

683
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,870
is not a sin, is it?

684
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,750
Every time my father does a good deed,

685
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,510
I would follow up by donating money.

686
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,710
Just like yesterday,

687
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,510
the money for ten thousand naan breads

688
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,390
was paid by me.

689
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,440
I even instructed the owner

690
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,790
to add more honey

691
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,950
when kneading the dough,

692
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,340
so that those poor people

693
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,790
could taste the sweetness in their mouths

694
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,790
and feel the warmth in their hearts.

695
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,430
Third Young Lady,

696
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,710
I truly admire

697
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,290
your kindness.

698
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,350
Why don't you hurry up and ask

699
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,410
something useful?

700
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,600
Or I'll just tell you directly.

701
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,830
We three sisters

702
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,380
and Duobao are not from the same mother,

703
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,580
but our relationship

704
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,710
was very good.

705
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,840
Duobao loved history books

706
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,150
and telling stories,

707
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,110
and adored every blade of grass and tree in Dunhuang.

708
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,990
His dream was

709
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,270
to introduce Dunhuang to more people.

710
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,390
He was an ambitious child.

711
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,470
Then

712
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,150
what about your two elder sisters,

713
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,640
Cao Yin and Cao Rong?

714
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,370
How did they treat Duobao?

715
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,190
Ms. Pei,

716
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,870
you are the Assistant Minister's daughter

717
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,950
and came from Chang'an,

718
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,670
yet you ask this kind of

719
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,950
trivial gossipy question.

720
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,110
I don't want to answer it.

721
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,070
Third Young Lady,

722
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,630
please don't misunderstand.

723
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,550
We also want to find

724
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,950
Duobao's murderer.

725
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,590
My eldest sister only cares about her husband.

726
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,510
My second sister only cares about the family fortune.

727
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,310
As for Duobao,

728
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,210
of course they didn't treat him well.

729
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,910
Can you tell us about your stepmother, Ye Lai?

730
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,510
No.

731
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,590
Why not.

732
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,310
Since she is my stepmother,

733
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,170
she is my elder.

734
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,810
I cannot speak ill of her behind her back.

735
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,110
Madam,

736
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,490
I think you are just too sad.

737
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,140
This won't do.

738
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,310
Do you feel

739
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,280
a tightness in your chest?

740
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,600
It's so tight that I can't breathe.

741
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,320
See? I could tell.

742
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,390
Madam,

743
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,370
let me feel your pulse.

744
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,500
I'll write you a prescription

745
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,700
and get you some medicine.

746
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,830
I guarantee you will feel some relief.

747
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,350
Madam.

748
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:54,950
Madam Cao,

749
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,940
please first tell us

750
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,800
about last night's dinner.

751
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,190
We were all there.

752
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,870
Duobao and me,

753
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,270
Yin,

754
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,750
Xiao,

755
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,070
and Saisai.

756
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,710
Fan Songling and Rong

757
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,670
came later.

758
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,540
We ate together.

759
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,130
Did you drink any alcohol?

760
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,560
No alcohol.

761
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,340
Why did they send you two to question me?

762
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,990
Where is that Sheriff Lu?

763
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,210
And the one surnamed Su,

764
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,260
the disciple of Detective Di.

765
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,030
Can they really

766
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,390
avenge my son?

767
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,430
Well...

768
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,040
My husband and I don't usually live here.

769
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,390
We hurried over in advance

770
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,290
to see my father off

771
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,410
for his 60th birthday funeral.

772
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,910
What,

773
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,310
you don't suspect me, do you?

774
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,620
It's not about suspicion.

775
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,440
It's just routine questioning.

776
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,230
I won't mind

777
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,650
even if you suspect me.

778
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,030
Now that Duobao is dead,

779
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,130
won't all the family property

780
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,400
be given to us three sisters?

781
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,870
How can we not be suspected?

782
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,429
But

783
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,929
I'm not a bad person.

784
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,460
I'm as softhearted

785
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,830
as a Bodhisattva.

786
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,280
Otherwise,

787
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,260
how could I have married Fan?

788
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,310
Yes,

789
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,710
why did you marry Chief Architect Fan?

790
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,110
Don't judge him by his age.

791
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,590
He is quite famous in Shazhou

792
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,520
because he is a trendsetter.

793
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,550
He's always the first to wear

794
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,670
the most fashionable

795
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,639
clothes and boots.

796
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:41,909
So,

797
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,440
he and I just hit it off.

798
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,469
As we spent more time together,

799
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,800
he started pursuing me.

800
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,730
I saw how hard he tried to win me over

801
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,989
and how pitiful he was,

802
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,909
so I was moved by compassion.

803
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,780
With your compassionate heart,

804
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,950
you created

805
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,630
a beautiful story of an old husband and young wife.

806
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,270
You really have a way with words.

807
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,020
Where were you at 9 p.m.

808
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,270
last night?

809
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,380
Right here.

810
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,180
What were you doing here?

811
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,990
Sleeping.

812
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,300
Fan is getting old.

813
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,390
He dozes off as soon as it gets dark.

814
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,270
Besides,

815
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,140
he has to go dance in the morning,

816
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,030
so he must go to bed early.

817
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,310
Going to bed early is indeed a good habit.

818
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:33,110
Did you two sleep together?

819
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,030
Of course.

820
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,250
As husband and wife, we always sleep in each other's arms.

821
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,050
We never sleep in separate beds.

822
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,780
Oh, right.

823
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,070
Is it okay for a couple

824
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,440
to be each other's alibi

825
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,940
for a murder case?

826
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,210
You must be Sheriff Lu.

827
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,040
We were sent by

828
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,270
Governor Zhang to assist with the case.

829
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,710
You've come at the right time.

830
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,430
Go and bring the murder suspect

831
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,470
to Qiande Hall.

832
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,470
Yes.

833
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,240
Go over there.

834
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,160
How can you treat Chief Architect Fan like this?

835
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,770
Mr. Fan is a pioneer of fashion in Shazhou.

836
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,490
He is a man of great prestige.

837
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,270
Mr. Su, you flatter me.

838
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,350
I just

839
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,790
wasted many years in vain,

840
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,630
but I did contribute to the construction of the Mogao Caves

841
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,590
to some extent.

842
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,790
Who asked about the Mogao Caves?

843
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,230
Fan Songling!

844
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,940
Yes?

845
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,770
Let me ask you.

846
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,390
Duobao's corpse

847
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,870
was first discovered by Cao Saisai,

848
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,510
correct?

849
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,390
How come

850
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,550
it's this young gentleman doing the questioning?

851
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,550
Answer properly.

852
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,080
What were you doing at that time?

853
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,150
At that time,

854
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,490
I had just gotten up

855
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,060
and was dancing in the courtyard.

856
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,040
I have loved dancing

857
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,590
ever since I was young.

858
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,830
Whether it's men's dances

859
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,890
or women's dances,

860
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,830
whether it's vigorous dances

861
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,190
or gentle dances,

862
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,430
I like them all.

863
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,350
I can do

864
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,670
the Nomadic Leap,

865
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,350
Sogdian Whirl

866
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,790
Yellow Roe,

867
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,470
and Green Waist.

868
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,990
I'm getting old now,

869
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,990
but my habits haven't changed.

870
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,630
Every morning when I get up,

871
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,030
I have to dance for a while.

872
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,400
Chief Architect Fan is still so energetic in your old age.

873
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,590
You flatter me.

874
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,030
You flatter me.

875
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,930
Oh, right.

876
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,130
Speaking of dancing,

877
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,990
my father-in-law, Mr. Cao,

878
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,150
is what I call a good dancer.

879
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,430
Mr. Cao can dance too?

880
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,720
Yes, he can.

881
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,600
What he's best at is the sword dance.

882
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,310
I didn't know that before.

883
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,030
You're getting off topic.

884
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,510
Talk about what happened this morning

885
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,830
and we'll see if it matches

886
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,830
what Saisai said.

887
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,570
Is this really necessary?

888
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,110
Speak.

889
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,700
At that time,

890
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,110
I was dancing the...

891
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,320
Mulberry Branch Dance.

892
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,630
This type of dance

893
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,990
is mostly performed by women,

894
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,620
but it's not that men can't dance it.

895
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,430
As for me,

896
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,110
I especially like it.

897
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,430
Uncle!

898
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,880
Uncle!

899
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,390
Uncle, when are we leaving?

900
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,990
Saisai,

901
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,150
your uncle probably isn't up yet.

902
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,580
No way.

903
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,220
Uncle Duobao never sleeps in.

904
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,310
Uncle!

905
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,650
Someone, come!

906
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,950
You repeated it correctly.

907
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,710
Saisai said

908
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,310
that as soon as you entered,

909
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,790
you shouted to the courtyard,

910
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,670
"Duobao has been strangled to death!"

911
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,270
Yes.

912
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,800
Such a big thing happened.

913
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,790
I had to let the whole family

914
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,630
know about it.

915
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,360
How do you know he was strangled?

916
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,220
I just said it casually.

917
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,350
Said it casually?

918
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,070
There are various ways

919
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,470
to murder someone.

920
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,110
Chief Architect Fan,

921
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,310
you're an expert in building caves.

922
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,320
I suppose you haven't learned to be a coroner before.

923
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,350
Even the best coroner in the Tang Dynasty

924
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,920
can't tell at a glance

925
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,160
that the person was strangled to death.

926
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,880
You didn't lift the ying cloth,

927
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,390
nor did you examine the body,

928
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,580
but you determined that the person was already dead

929
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,990
and had been strangled.

930
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,270
Unless

931
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,740
it was you who did it.

932
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,750
No!

933
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,350
I really guessed it.

934
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Then your guess was quite accurate.

935
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,390
It's completely consistent with my preliminary

936
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,650
postmortem findings.

937
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,710
You old thing,

938
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,910
it was you who strangled Duobao.

939
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,860
Otherwise, how could you say it so accurately?

940
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,760
No, no, no.

941
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,290
You can't talk nonsense.

942
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,280
You—

943
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,880
You are not prefecture officials.

944
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,340
You can't interrogate me.

945
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,110
Stop right there.

946
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,440
Governer Zhang ordered Mr. Su

947
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,390
and Sheriff Lu

948
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,030
to specially come and solve this case.

949
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,070
They are acting as temporary judicial adjutants.

950
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,200
If you dare to leave,

951
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,030
my Heng sword won't allow it.

952
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,310
I-I didn't say I was going to leave.

953
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,420
Murder cases need to be based on evidence.

954
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,190
You can't take what I

955
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,230
said casually

956
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,710
as evidence

957
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,510
I won't accept it.

958
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,800
Your fingernails

959
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,090
is the solid evidence.

960
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,950
Xue Huan.

961
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,800
The color and texture

962
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,060
are exactly the same.

963
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,550
This small piece

964
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,550
was found in Duobao's hair

965
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,090
behind his ear.

966
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,990
Chief Architect Fan,

967
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,430
you must regret

968
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,820
following trends now, right?

969
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,710
I...

970
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,430
Th-th-this is all

971
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,360
what Rong asked me to do.

972
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,030
Take Cao Rong

973
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,280
and interrogate them separately.
