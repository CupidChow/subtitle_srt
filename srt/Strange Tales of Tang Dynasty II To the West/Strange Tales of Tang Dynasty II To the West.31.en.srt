But it's strange.

99

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,190
I won't disturb you then.

384
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,340
Although she was wearing a veil,

385
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,030
I could still tell

386
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,070
she was a great beauty.

387
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,630
She was just not much of a talker.

388
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,510
She was probably from another city.

389
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,950
Do you know when that veiled woman

390
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,590
left?

391
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,880
That I know.

392
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,630
Not long after the deceased arrived,

393
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,700
she left.

394
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,470
Going out?

395
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,710
I have an appointment with a friend

396
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,770
to drink together.

397
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,590
Will you come back then?

398
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
It might be late.

399
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,470
Maybe

400
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,320
I won't come back at all.

401
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,590
What?

402
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,990
Is that not okay?

403
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,830
I gave you the room charge

404
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,360
for the whole day, didn't I?

405
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,860
By the way,

406
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,720
right after the woman wearing a veil left,

407
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,190
the ugly woman came back.

408
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,490
After that,

409
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,200
she asked for bath water.

410
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,880
The one staying in this room

411
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,630
is not that good-looking

412
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,670
but not ugly either.

413
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,390
She's the chubby type.

414
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,940
She is voluptuous

415
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,230
and flirtatious.

416
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,880
Men like women like her.

417
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,710
She is a local

418
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,960
and comes often.

419
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,550
Whenever she comes,

420
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,830
there will be men coming to stay in the middle of the night.

421
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,150
Last night too.

422
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,270
This so-called family inn of yours

423
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,110
doesn't lock the door at night?

424
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,270
Those who come here

425
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,190
are mostly men and women having secret trysts.

426
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,990
The men are afraid of being seen

427
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,820
and exposing their identities,

428
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,470
so they all come in the middle of the night.

429
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,790
If I lock the door,

430
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,550
won't I lose business?

431
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,070
Why are there so many piles of

432
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,430
things from the burial goods store?

433
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,030
This is my main business.

434
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,670
In this Shangxian Lane,

435
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,000
as long as someone dies,

436
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,390
or during the Cold Food Festival,

437
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,310
Mingyin Festival,

438
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,250
or the Hungry Ghost Festival,

439
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,760
whenever they need to burn paper offerings for the dead,

440
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,180
they all buy from me.

441
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,820
Is this the room where the Li Men stayed?

442
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,430
Yes.

443
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,930
Where is he?

444
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,130
I don't know when he left either.

445
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,010
Sheriff Lu.

446
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,640
You are indeed very observant.

447
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,990
When you're out investigating a case with me,

448
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,320
calling me 'Sheriff Lu'

449
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,500
sounds nice too.

450
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,170
What's the result?

451
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,730
Yingtao.

452
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,270
On the right side of the brain,

453
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,480
there are minor wounds

454
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,110
formed by blunt force trauma.

455
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,170
They are not fatal.

456
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,230
His complexion is almost normal.

457
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,390
His eyes are slightly opened.

458
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,190
On the neck,

459
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,150
there are signs of strangulation.

460
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,090
Was he strangled to death?

461
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,960
If he died from strangulation,

462
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,510
his mouth should have been opened and hands clenched,

463
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,190
but that is obviously not the case

464
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,270
for this corpse.

465
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,350
The deceased was found in a bathtub.

466
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,310
Around the mouth and nose,

467
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,240
there is no overflowing fine foam,

468
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,030
nor any traces

469
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,030
of dried foam.

470
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,230
There are no bruises on the face either.

471
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,200
The preliminary examination shows

472
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,130
the victim did not drown in the tub.

473
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,160
In that case,

474
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,790
the cause of death is uncertain?

475
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,090
We should start

476
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,030
by investigating the identity of the deceased.

477
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,420
Move aside.

478
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,550
Yesterday, I saw him at the entrance of

479
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,360
the Tianyi Fabric Shop.

480
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,510
That's right.

481
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,190
It's him.

482
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,160
What were you doing at the fabric shop?

483
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,830
It's irrelevant to this case.

484
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,440
If the preliminary postmortem is finished,

485
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,700
have the body carried back to the government office first.

486
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,990
As you wish.

487
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,190
Does every room have a bathtub?

488
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,750
Of course not.

489
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,030
Only this room has one.

490
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,590
Such a small inn,

491
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,490
and it's located on Shangxian Lane.

492
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,310
Why did you install

493
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,630
such a nice bathtub?

494
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,750
It's for charging more money.

495
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,270
There are pipes

496
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,210
connected under the bathtub.

497
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,070
The water can be

498
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,790
drained directly downstairs.

499
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,820
It can even drain water directly?

500
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,270
A room with a bathtub like this

501
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,980
would be considered a superior room

502
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,430
even in Chang'an.

503
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,480
For this bit of convenience,

504
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,350
the investment I made

505
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,290
still hasn't been recovered.

506
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,190
This place is temporarily closed for business.

507
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,230
As for when it can be reopened,

508
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,230
the government office will inform you.

509
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,630
Is this

510
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,430
appropriate?

511
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,880
It's very appropriate.

512
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,190
Whether in the capital

513
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,230
or in the state government,

514
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,510
once a murder case occurs,

515
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,550
before it's solved,

516
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,430
you won't be allowed to do business.

517
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,880
I will seal the place off later.

518
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,300
You

519
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,740
are not allowed to stay here either.

520
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,350
You're sealing the place?

521
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,160
As the owner,

522
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,430
will the government office hold you accountable?

523
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,850
That depends on whether you have

524
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,870
concealed information,

525
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,070
harbored suspects, or other offenses.

526
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,470
Now,

527
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,550
you need to cooperate with Ms. Pei

528
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,050
to complete the sketches

529
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,850
of the suspicious individuals.

530
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,150
Yes...

531
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,480
Suo Long,

532
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,640
find the owner of the Tianyi Fabric Shop

533
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,110
to identify the body at the county government.

534
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,170
See if he was a guest

535
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,650
or an employee of the shop.

536
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,670
Yes.

537
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,030
[Funeral]

538
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,840
Master,

539
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,580
He is my husband, Li Yun.

540
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,400
How did he die?

541
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,360
Although some external injuries were found,

542
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,490
they were not fatal.

543
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,620
The cause of death needs to be further investigated.

544
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,280
My name is Shen Ping.

545
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,260
My husband Li Yun and I

546
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,270
run the Tianyi Fabric shop together.

547
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,790
Yesterday afternoon,

548
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,590
he received a letter.

549
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,190
[Tianyi Fabric Shop]

550
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,470
Do you like it?

551
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,910
If it doesn't fit,

552
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,790
bring it back for alterations.

553
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,150
Okay.

554
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,470
Take care.

555
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,280
Let's go.

556
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,170
[To Li Yun]

557
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,340
The letter was discovered by me.

558
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,150
I don't know who sent it.

559
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,670
I didn't recognize you as the sheriff in the shop yesterday,

560
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,110
I apologize for the lack of hospitality.

561
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,710
Your hospitality was great.

562
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,390
Madam.

563
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,270
According to the owner of the Biluo Inn,

564
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,150
your husband's cousin Li Men

565
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,850
was staying there.

566
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,650
The letter was written by him.

567
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,950
He is an uneducated and untalented person.

568
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,790
But my husband

569
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,230
still wanted to help him for the sake of

570
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,110
family ties.

571
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,590
So I gave him a silver ingot.

572
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,310
He went out at dusk

573
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,310
and didn't return all night.

574
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,000
I thought

575
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,990
he must have been drinking and chatting with his cousin

576
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,270
and slept at the inn.

577
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,680
Did Li Yun have any chronic illnesses?

578
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,620
He used to have palpitations

579
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,790
and couldn't sleep well.

580
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,610
He often woke up suddenly from nightmares.

581
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,970
In the past six months,

582
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,870
Fang Jiong had been dragging him to cockfights.

583
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,600
He disregarded his shop duties

584
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,850
and had nothing weighing on his mind,

585
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,570
As a result, his condition actually got better.

586
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,390
Gambling?

587
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,470
Yes.

588
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,510
It's embarrassing.

589
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,550
How about your health, Madam?

590
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,040
It used to be very good.

591
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,600
but in the past year,

592
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,920
I have indeed become a bit frail.

593
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,230
I just inquired about it.

594
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,350
Your husband Li Yun

595
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,030
was very famous in Yunding.

596
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:34,820
Yes.

597
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,120
He had excellent tailoring skills

598
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,210
and studied diligently under my father.

599
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,010
Before my father passed away,

600
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,910
he entrusted the shop

601
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,260
and me

602
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,430
to him.

603
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,150
The fabrics he purchased were good,

604
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,410
and the clothes he made were even better.

605
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,590
Gradually,

606
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,030
Tianyi Fabric Shop became famous.

607
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,100
I see.

608
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,720
May I take

609
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,230
his body home?

610
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,240
Not yet.

611
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,790
The government office has no more questions

612
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,990
for you at the moment.

613
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,520
Madam, you may leave first.

614
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,220
Our people will come

615
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,310
to your place to inquire at any time.

616
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,470
Why were you so silent?

617
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,440
I'm just your personal secretary.

618
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,350
With Sheriff Lu here,

619
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,110
I have no place to speak

620
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,560
or interrogate anyone.

621
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,810
Stop your passive aggressiveness.

622
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,170
Did you notice anything suspicious?

623
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,560
Shen Ping just said he gave Li Yun

624
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,070
a silver ingot.

625
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,250
But at the crime scene,

626
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,390
we didn't find any silver ingot.

627
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,970
I have seen this silver ingot before.

628
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,750
With the silver ingot missing,

629
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,420
Li Men should be the prime suspect

630
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,680
for killing for money.

631
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,700
The wounds on Li Yun's head

632
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,190
and the strangulation marks on his neck

633
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,870
also prove there was a fight.

634
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,880
But no fatal injuries have been found yet.

635
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,260
Su Wuming.

636
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,850
Have you already got

637
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
a direction for the investigation,

638
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,390
and are deliberately testing me?

639
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,340
I wouldn't dare.

640
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,210
Well...

641
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,710
I was thinking.

642
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,430
Before Xijun

643
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,430
finishes those portraits,

644
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,550
I actually feel that

645
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,870
this piece of clay should be

646
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,300
a clue.

647
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,490
This kind of soil

648
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,770
is very sticky.

649
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,790
It should be used for firing bricks and tiles.

650
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,750
In Chang'an,

651
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,670
when I went to the Zhen's Office for an investigation,

652
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,420
I have also seen similar clay.

653
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,280
Sheriff, you're right.

654
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,350
In the capital, the Zhen's Office

655
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,260
is in charge of stone-carving and pottery-making matters.

656
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,180
While in prefectures and counties,

657
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,780
the place that uses this clay

658
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,960
to fire bricks and make tiles is called

659
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,150
a brick and tile kiln.

660
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,480
Suo Long.

661
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,190
Take a few men with you

662
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,190
and search all the brick and tile kilns in the city.

663
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,110
Any kiln worker who didn't return home last night

664
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,110
or went to Shangxian Lane after dark

665
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,910
must be brought back to the government office for questioning.

666
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,270
Yes.

667
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,800
What do you need me for?

668
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,630
I'm very busy at my clinic.

669
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,750
I have to treat patients, save lives,

670
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,950
and teach disciples.

671
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,580
Nowadays, I'm

672
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,750
not free at all.

673
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,380
I know you're busy.

674
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,280
I'm here to buy you a drink.

675
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:43,930
Not coming?

676
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,210
I...

677
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,520
Who do you think I am?

678
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,620
I said I'd never drink again.

679
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,630
It was no joke.

680
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,700
Unless...

681
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,500
unless all the mute slaves are cured by me.

682
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,670
Physician Fei.

683
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,470
We troubled you to come here this time

684
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,200
because I, Su, have something

685
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,830
to consult you about.

686
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,620
Why so polite all of a sudden?

687
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,190
What is it?

688
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,310
Tell me.

689
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,110
Physician Fei,

690
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,550
when the corpse was discovered,

691
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,679
it was soaking in the bathtub.

692
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,420
But there were no signs of drowning.

693
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,949
There were only light wounds

694
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,850
on the head and neck.

695
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,870
But such wounds

696
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,370
are not enough to be fatal.

697
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,929
The deceased had heart palpitations when he was alive.

698
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,550
So we asked you here

699
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,429
to take a look

700
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,900
and see if he might have died suddenly

701
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,110
during an argument or fight with someone

702
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,310
due to a sudden attack

703
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,510
of his condition.

704
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,830
There are many causes of palpitations.

705
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,670
They can be mainly divided into four categories.

706
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,190
First,

707
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,710
it's due to illness.

708
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,310
Second,

709
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,870
it's due to emotional stress.

710
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,510
Third,

711
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,670
it's due to overexertion.

712
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,990
And fourth,

713
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,030
it's from ingesting the wrong thing.

714
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,090
For example,

715
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,880
taking the wrong medicine.

716
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,330
What did he do for a living?

717
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,510
He was a fabric shop owner,

718
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,580
the most famous tailor in Yunding.

719
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,070
Then it shouldn't be due to overexertion.

720
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,750
His wife also said

721
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,890
that he often had nightmares.

722
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,430
Since he had nightmares,

723
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,600
then it should belong to the second category.

724
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,500
That is, it was caused by long-term

725
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,790
and continuous mental stress.

726
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,150
Lift it up a bit more.

727
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,880
Let me take a look at the corpse.

728
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,950
When a person suddenly falls ill

729
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,310
and dies abruptly,

730
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,760
it's usually due to the

731
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,390
heart,

732
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,580
head,

733
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,500
or respiratory problems.

734
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,230
From my observation of Li Yun's corpse,

735
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,480
there are no signs of these three conditions.

736
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,570
In other words,

737
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,550
his death

738
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,510
has nothing to do with illness.

739
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,510
The murderer is quite skillful.

740
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,390
Even Su Wuming's autopsy

741
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,880
couldn't determine the cause of death.

742
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,200
He seems to be implying that you are incompetent.

743
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,150
I got it.

744
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,510
[County]

745
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,230
I didn't return to my residence last night

746
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,450
because I was visiting my lover.

747
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,290
She is a widow.

748
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,850
This isn't illegal, right?

749
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,740
I did go to Shangxian Lane.

750
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,590
But I was just passing by.

751
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,970
If I had known, I wouldn't have said anything.

752
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,950
Stop right there!

753
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,290
So afraid of being interrogated at the government office...

754
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,090
I'm afraid

755
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,540
you're more than just a kiln worker.

756
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,860
This joint investigation file is from the

757
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,350
neighboring county last year.

758
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,480
It matches all your characteristics.

759
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,150
Twelve burglaries and

760
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,480
seven counts of murder.

761
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,730
Did you hide in Yuding under the guise

762
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,800
of a kiln worker

763
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,670
because of the fine wine

764
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,960
or the night market?

765
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,870
If you don't say a word,

766
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,780
you're just waiting to die.

767
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,450
Now that you've caught me,

768
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,050
I don't have a chance to live.

769
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,610
It's good that you've started talking.

770
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,110
Do you know how we found you?

771
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,240
I don't care to know.

772
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,710
You murderous thief.

773
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,710
How dare you talk louder than the sheriff?

774
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,030
If you answer

775
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,600
my questions properly,

776
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,440
they might serve you wine and meat

777
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,700
when you're in prison.

778
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,190
If you talk so loudly,

779
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,910
not only will my men

780
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,170
beat you for provoking them,

781
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,540
they will also not give you

782
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,830
any food or drink.

783
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,210
Can you handle that?

784
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,350
Tell me.

785
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,430
Last night, did you visit the Biluo Inn?

786
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:13,870
Yes.

787
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,360
What did you go there for?

788
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,750
To meet my lover in secret.

789
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,230
What's your lover's name?

790
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,670
I can't say.

791
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,430
She's been good to me.

792
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,010
How could I implicate her?

793
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,490
How chivalrous of you.

794
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,490
While meeting your lover,

795
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,290
did you also happen to kill someone?

796
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,390
I didn't kill him!

797
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,430
So you knew someone died.

798
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,230
I...

799
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,430
Fine.

800
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,310
I admit it.

801
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,730
I came across his body.

802
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,020
I took the silver ingot.

803
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,180
But I really didn't kill that man.

804
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,170
He was lying in the bathtub.

805
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,230
His hands were cold and stiff.

806
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,390
He had been dead for a long time.

807
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,790
You didn't kill this man.

808
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,030
What about the seven lives in the neighboring county?

809
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,910
Are you admitting to those?

810
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,910
I haven't admitted to anything yet!

811
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,400
At dawn, before daybreak,

812
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,680
that dead man's hands

813
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,100
must have looked eerie and horrifying.

814
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,790
If you had never killed anyone before,

815
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,390
would you dare to touch them?

816
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,110
You sure know how to beat around the bush, Sheriff.

817
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:07,910
Fine.

818
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,670
I admit it.

819
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,670
I have killed people.

820
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,990
But I don't admit

821
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,320
to killing seven people.

822
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,130
That's way too little.

823
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,140
You bunch of useless fools.

824
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,290
You only investigated the neighboring county.

825
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,110
What about what I did

826
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,480
in Shazhou and Hanzhou?

827
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,030
I must have killed

828
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,830
at least 20 people.
