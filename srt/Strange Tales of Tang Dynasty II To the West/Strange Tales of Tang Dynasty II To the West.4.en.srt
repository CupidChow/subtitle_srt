Don't blame yourself, Brother.

Sir.

22
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,590
There's no business anyway.

31
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,640

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,940
Why would a small shop like mine

36
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,290
dare sell such things?

37
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,150
We are inviting you over

38
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,550
because the Supreme Court's detective

39
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,470
found out that

40
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,080
you've accepted

42
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,270
If you don't tell me the truth,

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,180
I can only

take you to the government office for trial.

But the business...

48

has been so bad.

49
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,820
It's mainly because of Bi Chengye's

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,890
I'm upset about it.

54
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,990

55
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,390
by selling Flying Light.

56
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,110
So,

57
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,560
I also wanted to take the risk.

58
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,150
Take the risk?

59
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,910

cause I was afraid you'd be too tired.

68
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,880

I didn't disturb you

90

cause I saw you sleeping.

91
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,290
Since all three of you are here,

92
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,620
let's discuss the case.

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,480
In this one day and one night,

94
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,630
did the Mara do anything again?

95
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,850
Another official was killed?

96
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,590
Did his liver get dug out too?

97
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,070
No.

98
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,970
It's just that, as you fell asleep last night,

99
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,920
His Majesty's decree arrived,

100
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,950
saying you should not be interfering in this case anymore.

101
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,210
It will be handed over to Su Wuming fully.

102
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,600
Her Highness also sent a message

103
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,070
that you should recuperate.

104
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,110
She also sent over

105
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,710
many precious herbs for you.

106
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,310
I'll send it over

107
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,150
to you later.

108
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,250
No need!

109
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,030
Just say that I've recovered

110
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,110
and return all the herbs

111
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,770
back to the Princess' Palace.

112
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,470
Yes.

113
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,950
How many more old cases

114
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,260
are there in the Supreme Court?

115
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,590
Pick the important ones

116
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,920
and bring them to me.

117
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,950
Since I came to the Supreme Court,

118
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,150
I've been making it difficult for you everyday.

119
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,140
You don't blame me, do you?

120
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,510
How can we blame you?

121
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,190
You are quick in solving cases.

122
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,250
We can all see that.

123
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,680
And no one has been wronged

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,280
for all the solved old cases.

125
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,190
You're really

126
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,710
akin to Detective Di.

127
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,320
How can I compare to Detective Di?

128
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,790
Now I can only clear the old case as soon as possible

129
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,950
and serve the court

130
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,320

131
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,840
Lu Lingfeng.

132
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,120
Where is my brother?

133
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,590
Given His Majesty's verbal instruction,

134
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,190
this case has been assigned to him.

135
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,510
I am not allowed to get involved anymore.

136
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,710
How would I know where he went?

137
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,940
He came back from Qianling

138
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,750
to help you.

139
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,650
Why are you being so petty?

140
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,350
What are you holding?

141
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,130
Commander Hu's portrait.

142
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,470
Commander Hu?

143
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,910
Who is that?

144
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,960
He's the one who made

145
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,790
Collator Liangzhi catch bookworms in Cloud Tower.

146
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,000
From the Mara's case

147
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,350
to investigating bookworms...

148
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,670
Su Wuming...

149
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,710
Did you draw this?

150
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,030
No.

151
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,670
From the ink,

152
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,150
it looks like it was just painted.

153
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,280
Yet you don't admit?

154
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,990
Just painted?

155
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,650
The file has nothing to do with the painting.

156
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,270
Could it be...

157
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,110
Unfortunately, I messed up

158
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,040
all these files.

159
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,010
I wonder who left this painting.

160
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,450
The snake is strangling the tortise.

161
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,740
Black Tortise?

162
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,110
That's right.

163
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,430
It's one of the Four Holy Beasts. It signifies the north.

164
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,190
The north?

165
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,560
What other Supreme Court buildings

166
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,110
[North Pavilion]

167
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,320
have the word

168
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,540
"north" in it?

169
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,770
This is the only place.

170
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,630
Open the door.

171
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,110
Yes.

172
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:35,840
Who is it?

173
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,830
It must be Elder Zhou.

174
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,870
Mr. Lu is here to patrol the North Pavilion.

175
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,130
Come out and greet him.

176
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,350
Greetings, Mr. Lu.

177
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,730
Elder Zhou?

178
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,980
My name is Zhou Lao.

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm old,

180
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,890
[Zhou Lao]

181
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,620
so they call me Elder Zhou.

182
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,320
What are you doing here?

183
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,630
He used to be a prison warden in the Supreme Court.

184
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,830
Because he's single,

185
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,710
after he retired,

186
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,270
he didn't want to leave the the Supreme Court,

187
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,030
so we arranged a job for him to overlook a warehouse.

188
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,750
He lives in the North Pavilion.

189
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,630
He lives here,

190
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,350
but the door is locked from outside?

191
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,380
I don't want to go out and meet anyone,

192
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,350
so I don't think there's anything bad

193
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,220
with me being locked up here.

194
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,950
All right!

195
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,820
You may leave.

196
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,630
I don't need anyone to accompany me

197
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,030
as I look through the files.

198
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,510
Sir,

199
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,620
come back tomorrow morning.

200
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,030
Why?

201
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,630
There are too many cases

202
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,630
accumulated in the North Pavilion.

203
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,730
Over time,

204
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,830
it's inevitable that there is an aura of vengeful spirits.

205
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,130
Especially in the middle of the night, when the Yin energy is heavy,

206
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,590
it's–

207
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,190
Is that so?

208
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,330
Then I'll wait for the vengeful spirit to appear

209
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,890
and hear their grievances.

210
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,350
Secretary Zhang,

211
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,580
please leave.

212
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,110
Yes.

213
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,030
Elder Zhou, go get some rest.

214
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,410
Mr. Lu.

215
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Call me if there's a ghost.

216
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,530
I've worked in the Supreme Court Prison

217
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,920
for decades.

218
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,550
Let alone ghosts,

219
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,230
I'm not afraid of even tens of thousands

220
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,120
of demons or spirits.

221
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,590
It's just strong wind.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,670
Don't be afraid.

223
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,430
Chengfo Temple. Dr. Li.

224
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,360
It's a case from a month ago.

225
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,070
These two cases

226
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,110
are indeed from a month ago.

227
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,850
As for why the files

228
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,070
was put in the North Pavilion,

229
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,190
I have no idea.

230
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,910
Who was the last person

231
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,170
to handle these cases?

232
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,610
Chang Fang.

233
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,290
After Director Chang read it,

234
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,790
Director Cheng had a look too.

235
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,380
But it ended up being unsolved.

236
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,360
[Chengfo Temple]

237
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,140
Mr. Lu.

238
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,550
Mr. Lu.

239
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,910
Why are you... here at this hour?

240
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,070
I was just passing by.

241
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,870
I would like a cup of tea with you.

242
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,030
Dr. Li worked in the Ministry of Rites

243
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,400
and managed the monasteries and nunneries.

244
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,830
Later,

245
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,810
he returned the house he rented

246
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,530
and moved into the temple.

247
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,910
How meticulous.

248
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,760
It's not just to save money.

249
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,950
Dr. Li was devoted to Buddha.

250
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,030
Living here helped him

251
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,510
study Buddhism.

252
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,790
That night,

253
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,440
I heard that Dr. Li didn't eat...

254
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,010
Dr. Li.

255
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,910
So I brought him food.

256
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,910
According to the file,

257
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,550
Dr. Li died of a stroke.

258
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,910
When I saw Dr. Li was dead,

259
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,240
I sent someone to report to the government.

260
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,910
People from both Chang'an County and Yongzhou Government

261
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,590
came.

262
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,590
As he had no external injuries

263
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,120
nor any signs of poisoning,

264
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,950
and the fact that

265
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,910
he once had a stroke living in the temple,

266
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,240
I made this assumption.

267
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,610
Where was the body was buried?

268
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,880
It hasn't been buried.

269
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,460
When I was an official in the capital,

270
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,650
I've been long troubled by my stroke.

271
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,110
After the last time it happened,

272
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,440
though I've recovered,

273
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,320
I don't know when it will happen again.

274
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,560
If something goes wrong...

275
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,980
I hope you can help me.

276
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,230
Don't say that.

277
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,120
What do you mean by help you?

278
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,150
I'm a Feiliao from Lingnan.

279
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,750
According to our tradition,

280
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,940
after I die...

281
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,310
my body should be buried under a tree.

282
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,440
Buried under a tree?

283
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,980
That’s the custom of Feiliao people.

284
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,030
So you

285
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,090
buried him on Zhongnan Mountain?

286
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,990
I wanted to bury him

287
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,150
there,

288
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,750
but...

289
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,480
those people who were sent that day were lazy

290
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,950
and buried him at the halfway point

291
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,360
at Leyou Plain.

292
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,430
How dare they!

293
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,680
Leyou Plain is not a place for burials!

294
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,350
I was also furious.

295
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,310
But...

296
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,710
At this point,

297
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,540
I shouldn't disturb Dr. Li any further.

298
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,870
Later I found out

299
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
those people were new to the temple.

300
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,590
They are not kind.

301
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,430
That's why

302
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,870
during this period,

303
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,510
there was a case where the monks

304
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,990
fought with the people.

305
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,910
That's right.

306
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,840
After this, I will investigate thoroughly

307
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,410
and expel those who are of poor character

308
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,080
from the temple.

309
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,430
Where exactly in Leyou Plain was it?

310
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,390
Near to

311
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,750
a forest at the northeast corner of

312
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,880
Shengping Quarter.

313
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,030
Please excuse me.

314
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,790
Wait.

315
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,990
You want to go to

316
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,150
Leyou Plain now?

317
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,070
You must not.

318
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,380
It is said that

319
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,190
after a Feiliao person is buried under the tree,

320
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,090
the body can connect with the Netherworld

321
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,550
through the tree's roots.

322
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,710
On a full moon night,

323
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,220
it can obtain the spiritual energy of heaven and earth

324
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,990
and resurrect its head.

325
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,350
Once his head breaks its own neck,

326
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,350
it can head to its afterlife.

327
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,790
During this process,

328
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,390
if anyone is to interrupt,

329
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,830
the spirits and evil ghosts

330
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,550
will kill people.

331
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,630
The victim's head can fly at night?

332
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,450
What a joke!

333
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,590
It's as ridiculous as the Mara escaping the wall.

334
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,150
As the Abbot of Chengfo Temple,

335
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,310
if you keep spreading this rumor,

336
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,050
you will be punished!

337
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,350
[Bright moon, peaceful heart]

338
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,490
The head would break its neck and fly?

339
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,150
Although Lu is pretty skilled,

340
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,590
it's easy

341
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,990
for Lord to kill him.

342
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,200
When I saw him at the Ghost Market that day,

343
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,350
I fell in love with a man

344
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,870
as righteous as he is.

345
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,760
Don't you two

346
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,270
snatch him from me.

347
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,750
No!

348
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,310
I let you have that person

349
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,230
in the ghost market that day.

350
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,670
It's my turn this time.

351
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,270
Stop arguing.

352
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,790
My Lord has ordered

353
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,510
that I have to

354
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,810
dig his liver myself.

355
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,620
I've never killed a female criminal

356
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,890
in my lifelong career as a detective.

357
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,750
But you demons

358
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,730
took Guo Zhuang's liver in the Ghost Market.

359
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,330
You deserve to die.

360
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,950
The shopkeeper of Qilian Painting Shop said

361
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,190
this is the place where Flying Light

362
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,850
is dealt at.

363
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,680
A few buyers have already entered.

364
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,750
It's time.

365
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,830
Let me go.

366
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,270
Although my martial arts skills

367
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,750
can't be compared to Lu Lingfeng's,

368
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,790
it's more than enough

369
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,250
to deal with some thieves.

370
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,190
Since they are thieves,

371
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,870
there's nothing to be afraid of.

372
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,270
I'm not as quick-witted

373
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,950
as you are.

374
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,150
But my life is worthless.

375
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,410
I can go on your behalf.

376
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,920
Everyone's life

377
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,610
is irreplaceable.

378
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,520
There is no hierarchy.

379
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,750
Besides, I'm going to talk about business.

380
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,200
It's nothing dangerous.

381
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,260
Easy for you to say!

382
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,590
What kind of business is dealt at 4AM?

383
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,670
Those people inside

384
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,930
are all wearing masks.

385
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,810
It's scary just looking at it.

386
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,510
Masks?

387
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,650
I prepared one.

388
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,360
It must be your first time here.

389
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,870
You have to wait for them to call for you.

390
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,630
You can only go when you're called.

391
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,630
Follow the rules.

392
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,230
Don't make everyone lose the opportunity

393
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,360
to get the treasure.

394
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,310
Come out together.

395
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,070
We're out of stock today.

396
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,150
You can leave now.

397
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:52,840
No!

398
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,490
My buyer wants it urgently.

399
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,890
The price is negotiable.

400
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,550
I can pay double.

401
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,510
I said we're out of stock!

402
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,410
If you want something,

403
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,110
come back in two days.

404
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,670
Can I pay some deposit first?

405
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,160
So you can give me more goods when the time comes.

406
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,970
No!

407
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,470
The bidding is in two days.

408
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,270
The highest bidder

409
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,370
will get it!

410
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,030
-Mr. Su.
-Mr. Su.

411
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,010
You saw it clearly?

412
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,770
There are four of them.

413
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,220
They don't know each other.

414
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,110
It's almost dawn.

415
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,550
Each of us take on

416
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,030
one of them.

417
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,690
We must bring them back

418
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,630
to the Supreme Court.

419
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,890
-Yes!
-Yes!

420
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,490
[North Pavilion]

421
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,790
Mr. Lu.

422
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,630
Why didn't you bring the key?

423
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,270
The North Pavilion is an important place.

424
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,730
How do I explain it now that

425
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,430
you've ruined the lock?

426
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,070
You do know martial arts.

427
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,100
They're just some basics I practiced since I was a child.

428
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,230
Why did you set me up?

429
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,510
The four people we caught

430
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,290
have confessed.

431
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,310
They are all owners or shopkeepers

432
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,370
of painting shops.

433
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,290
After the Mid-Autumn Festival,

434
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:58,950
they received news about Flying Light

435
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,710
being sold.

436
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,690
For profit,

437
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,790
they are willing to purchase

438
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,140
Flying Light at a high price

439
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,190
through such a weird method at the Dragon King Temple

440
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,830
to sell them at an even higher price.

441
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,110
These people are so evil.

442
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,970
This mere paint

443
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,360
made them a lot of money.

444
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,830
Send someone!

445
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Lock him up first.

446
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,570
I'm going to interrogate him myself.

447
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,430
What are you waiting for?

448
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,290
-Yes.
-Yes.

449
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,230
Zhou Lao?

450
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,340
It's really you.

451
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,940
It's been years since we parted in Luoyang.

452
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,080
I didn't expect that after returning to Chang'an,

453
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,980
you've followed over too.

454
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,510
I'm Su Wuming. Greetings, Sir.

455
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,030
Why did you greet him?

456
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,820
Greet him with me.

457
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,580
I remember now.

458
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,920
Su Wuming.

459
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,930
Di Renjie's disciple.

460
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,220
What are you doing in the Supreme Court Prison?

461
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,030
I–

462
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,210
This is the new

463
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,790
Deputy President of the Supreme Court.

464
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,830
In that case,

465
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,710
I should be the one greeting you.

466
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,470
But...

467
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,920
Lu Lingfeng!

468
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,070
Untie him.

469
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,500
What are you glaring at?

470
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,760
I told you to untie him!

471
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,840
This old sir

472
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,470
is the benefactor of our master, Detective Di.

473
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,950
Back then, Detective Di was framed

474
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,350
and sent into the prison.

475
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,190
Fortunately, someone secretly helped him

476
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,430
to be released.

477
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,810
I didn’t expect that to be Elder Zhou.

478
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,040
In that case,

479
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,550
I should greet you.

480
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,270
There is no need.

481
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,490
I was not his benefactor.

482
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,570
Back then,

483
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,190
I was not the only one

484
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,630
who helped Detective Di back then.

485
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,590
Elder Zhou,

486
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,510
have a seat.

487
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,470
Lu Lingfeng

488
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,070
is Detective Di's disciple.

489
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,950
You deserve

490
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,470
this greeting.

491
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,400
But I want to know

492
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,460
if you

493
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,470
did tell someone else my schedule

494
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,600
and plot against me?

495
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,430
It wasn't me.

496
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,230
I've never left the North Pavilion.

497
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,590
How could I plot against you?

498
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,860
How can you prove that

499
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,040
you've never left the North Pavilion?

500
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,470
I was ignorant

501
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,160
and followed Lai Junchen

502
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,340
to execute people.

503
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,220
I've killed so many people.

504
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,060
As my position was lowly,

505
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,390
I was not punished.

506
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,000
But deep in my heart,

507
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,630
I can't forgive myself.

508
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,150
I was too ashamed to see my parents.

509
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,310
After that,

510
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,440
I stayed in North Pavilion in the name of a caretaker,

511
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,590
but in fact,

512
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,020
I was actually locking myself in there

513
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,030
to atone.

514
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,570
You deliberately made me

515
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,270
find those

516
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,110
two files?

517
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,060
It was about a month ago.

518
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,820
[North Pavilion]

519
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,280
Who's there?

520
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,440
Who's there?

521
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,760
Someone

522
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,320
mixed the recent case files

523
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,050
into the old cases stored in the North Pavilion.

524
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,130
That day, you came late at night.

525
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,430
At first sight,

526
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,400
I could tell you're upright.

527
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,800
I thought

528
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,990
you might be here for this,

529
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,030
so I put the file in an obvious place,

530
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,340
so that you can spend less effort finding it.

531
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,150
Given what you said,

532
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,190
that beast should be a mupu.

533
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,030
What's that?

534
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,600
I've never heard of it.

535
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,910
This beast has a snake's head and turtle's tail.

536
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,750
It has four claws

537
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,200
and live on trees.

538
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,960
It becomes ferocious when there's fire.

539
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Those that are huge eat humans.

540
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,470
It becomes ferocious when there's fire?

541
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,630
So that weird head was spitting fire

542
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,790
to attract the mupu.

543
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,470
That's highly possible.

544
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,990
In this case,

545
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,830
our opponent should not be underestimated.

546
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,470
They are the people behind the previous chaos after all.

547
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,400
What do you mean?

548
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,150
The beast is raised by them.

549
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,470
Wait.

550
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,610
It seems to be here.

551
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,480
Where is that half body?

552
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,130
Since that weird head is an illusion mechanism,

553
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,770
the lower half of the body

554
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,550
should be fake too.

555
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,840
If they buried Dr. Li here,

556
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,910
the body would've been

557
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,350
discovered long ago.

558
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,140
Let's search deeper in.

559
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,160
Over there!

560
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,510
Write this down.

561
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,070
There are no wounds on the eyes, nose, lips,

562
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,390
neck, as well as the head.

563
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,190
There are no signs of poisoning.

564
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,150
Water.

565
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,520
Write this down.

566
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,510
There's blood on both left and right ear canals.

567
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,310
Could it be that something sharp

568
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,950
was stabbed into his ears?

569
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,990
We need to have a cerebral examination.

570
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,520
Write this down.

571
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,470
There's a needle-shaped object

572
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,950
in both ears.

573
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,480
They are three inches long.

574
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,350
Are the coroners of

575
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,670
Chang'an County and Yongzhou Government

576
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,390
useless?

577
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,200
Exactly!

578
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,750
Dr. Li was murdered.

579
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,400
How did they not find that?

580
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,190
Dr. Li died on August 16.

581
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,790
Do you remember the Mid-Autumn Festival

582
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,870
magic show at the Sky-scraping Tower?

583
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,960
Most of the people in Chang'an

584
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,050
were busy that day.

585
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,680
So as all the things came together, people of the government offices

586
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,030
couldn't reunite with their family.

587
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,550
So when they saw that there are no wounds

588
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,510
nor symptoms of poisoning on Dr. Li's body,

589
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,160
they just decided that

590
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,480
it was caused by a stroke

591
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,780
to close the case quickly.

592
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,150
They were in a hurry to go home!

593
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,670
This is disregarding human lives!

594
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,800
These officials...

595
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,440
Come and help.

596
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,790
His liver has been removed.

597
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,970
The wound is not

598
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,350
white and dry but

599
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,560
filled with blood, has patterns on it,

600
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,230
and has tightened skin.

601
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,800
This means...

602
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,450
when Mr. Li's liver was taken out,

603
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,590
he wasn't dead.

604
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,880
Yes.

605
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,760
Such wounds can only occur

606
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,970
when there's blood circulation.

607
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,050
In other words,

608
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,630
when the needle pierced his ears,

609
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,930
Dr. Li was only damaged in the head

610
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,270
and was in a deep coma.

611
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,580
After Chang'an County and Yongzhou Government decided

612
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,530
that it was a stroke,

613
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,030
the murderer took the liver.

614
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,000
Took...

615
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,070
Took the liver...

616
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,130
This is why this needle

617
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,760
is only three inches long.

618
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,940
This murderer is vicious

619
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,730
and is evil.

620
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,030
Dr. Li.

621
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,160
Sorry to bother you.

622
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,150
Jia.

623
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,740
Please find a remote and quiet place

624
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,590
in Zhongnan Mountain

625
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,590
to bury Dr. Li.

626
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,840
Buy some paper money

627
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,030
and send Dr. Li off.

628
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,360
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

629
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,040
Dr. Li should be the first victim

630
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,500
of this case.

631
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,570
He died just before

632
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,170
I entered the Supreme Court.

633
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,390
They heard that you've been investigating old cases since you came,

634
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,940
so they moved the files

635
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,270
to the North Pavilion

636
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,510
because they didn't want you to see it.

637
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,310
No matter who's behind this,

638
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,480
they have been planning for a long time.

639
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,550
You are right.

640
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,030
Is this true?

641
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,840
I...

642
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,910
I'm so sorry.

643
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,110
How many people

644
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,470
did you send for the burial under the tree?

645
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,350
Four.

646
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,390
Bring them here.

647
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,200
I'll interrogate them one by one.

648
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,510
They are no longer in the temple.

649
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,670
What?

650
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,670
Two of them got in a fight with commoners because

651
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,160
of their bad character

652
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,590
and were expelled

653
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,550
The other two,

654
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,640
not long after this,

655
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,150
they left without saying goodbye.

656
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,150
Chengfo Temple

657
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,790
is the Royal Temple.

658
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,220
Although most of you are monks,

659
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,870
you are managed by the Ministry of Rites.

660
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,790
How could this happen?

661
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,790
These people came to the temple

662
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,090
in the past two months.

663
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,870
They were recommended by Commander Cen from the Princess' Palace.

664
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,550
How could I not take them in?

665
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,870
Cen Zhi?

666
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,270
That's him.

667
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,030
He just left.

668
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,110
He's furious because Qin Xiaobai didn't get to

669
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,440
do the finishing touch.

670
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,900
He looked really fierce.

671
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,159
Your Highness.

672
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,360
I have returned from Chengfo Temple.

673
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,989
Qin Xiaobai is still drinking alcohol.

674
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:20,719
I don't think

675
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:21,510
he intends to

676
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,170
do the finishing touch at all.

677
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,030
It's the Mingyin Festival the day after tomorrow.

678
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,960
Doesn't he know?

679
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,840
He looks crazy.

680
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,989
I'm afraid you've appointed

681
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:31,960
the wrong person this time.

682
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,360
I've seen that painting.

683
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,580
It's really good.

684
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,070
It's just the finishing touch.

685
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,389
Why does he refuse to

686
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,489
complete it?

687
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,590
I trusted him so much.

688
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,409
I found a few painters.

689
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,639
The list is here.

690
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,560
Please have a look.

691
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,520
These people

692
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,050
are willing to work for you

693
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,870
to add the finishing touch to "Mara's Defeat."

694
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,360
I don't like any of them.

695
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,350
Princess,

696
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,670
the day after tomorrow

697
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,670
is the day you've been planning for.

698
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,750
We can’t delay it

699
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,100
because of Qin Xiaobai.

700
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,540
I thought of someone.

701
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:22,910
You...

702
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,290
I am the regimental commander from the Princess' Palace, Cen Zhi.

703
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,590
Ms. Pei, please forgive me

704
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,450
for entering from your backyard.

705
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,910
What is it?

706
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,750
Her Highness

707
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,250
asks for a favor from you.

708
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,710
Dr. Li lived here.

709
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,000
After he left, it was locked

710
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,630
and no one has entered since.

711
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,280
Please help yourselves.

712
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,510
I'll wait here.

713
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,750
Su Wuming.

714
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,870
Come and look!

715
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,830
The monks are not monks.

716
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,870
The wall is not a wall.

717
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,700
Master!

718
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Bad news, Master.

719
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,990
Commander Cen is here again!

720
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,250
He looks like he's going to kill someone!

721
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,400
Are you still thinking?

722
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,510
It's not that complicated.

723
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,190
No!

724
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,630
No, Commander Cen.

725
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,360
You're threatening me?

726
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:09,850
Not me.

727
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,990
Her Highness

728
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,910
ordered you to complete the finishing touch immediately.

729
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,070
It's simple.

730
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,230
Otherwise, you'll be beheaded.

731
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,830
Not to mention the princess,

732
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,910
even if His Majesty

733
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,670
holds a knife on my neck,

734
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,470
without inspiration,

735
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,230
I won't add the finishing touches

736
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,910
and complete the work.

737
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,520
Qin Xiaobai.

738
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,030
This is the last chance

739
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,190
I'm giving you.

740
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,070
Why aren't you picking up the brush?

741
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,870
Never.

742
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,950
Ms. Pei.

743
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,790
You do it.

744
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,670
Ms. Pei.

745
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,550
If anyone wants to touch my "Mara's Defeat,"

746
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,710
you have to step over my body!

747
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,230
Mr. Qin!

748
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,700
You misunderstood.

749
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,390
Although they invited me,

750
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,520
I won't do anything.

751
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,090
Commander Cen,

752
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,590
please go back and report to the princess:

753
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,990
this painting is special

754
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,340
and sacred.

755
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,840
I will never complete the finishing touch

756
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,440
of someone else's work.

757
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,030
You dare disobey the princess' order?

758
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,000
Please go back and report to the princess that

759
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,930
she should believe in Qin Xiaobai,

760
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,350
that he would complete "Mara's Defeat"

761
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,010
before the Mingyin Festival.

762
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,360
Do you think

763
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,430
I can't find another painter?

764
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,070
You can.

765
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,670
If you use money

766
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,190
half of Chang'an people

767
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,550
would pretend to be a painter to come do the finishing touch.

768
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,410
But there is only one Qin Xiaobai.

769
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,730
There’s only one "Mara's Defeat."

770
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,790
The deadline is not up yet.

771
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,550
If you

772
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,860
act rashly

773
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,990
and ruin

774
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,190
this legendary work,

775
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,900
who will the princess

776
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,360
punish?

777
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:11,670
You!

778
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,830
Qin Xiaobai!

779
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,810
Let me tell you.

780
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,750
Princess is not His Majesty.

781
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,880
She has a bad temper.

782
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,390
On Mingyin Festival,

783
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,150
she will come consecrate it.

784
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,310
By then,

785
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,830
if you don't want to be cut into pieces,

786
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,610
complete this wall painting!

787
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,700
Amitabha.

788
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,310
Let's go.

789
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,630
Let's go.

790
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,150
Let's go.

791
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:01,010
♫Ruan Ji is not sober most of the time♫

792
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,990
♫Tao Qian is always drunk♫

793
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:17,610
♫What is a hundred years' worth?♫

794
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:30,050
♫Enjoy the moment and sing a long song♫

795
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,940
You compare yourself to Ruan Ji and Tao Qian.

796
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,830
What you should do now

797
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,430
is to relax.

798
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,830
Relax...

799
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,750
I've been drawing since I was young.

800
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,070
It's been over 40 years.

801
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,630
This Mara's Defeat

802
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,510
may be the most important work

803
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,230
in my life.

804
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,060
In other words,

805
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,190
this mural

806
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,270
may be

807
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,400
my life.

808
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,270
That’s why

809
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,720
you lost all your inspiration.

810
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,830
You're famous in Tang.

811
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,350
Yet because of your reputation,

812
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,090
you lost the freedom you had because you became famous.

813
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,440
Freedom?

814
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:36,830
Yes.

815
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,920
As long as you can

816
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,950
find the freedom you lost,

817
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,250
you will definitely be able to finish the mural.

818
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,310
before the unveil.

819
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,350
In the past,

820
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,840
I was arrogant

821
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,630
and wanted to take you as my disciple.

822
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,790
Yet today,

823
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,470
you're my teacher.

824
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,110
Mr. Qin!
