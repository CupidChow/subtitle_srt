00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,950
Miss,

5
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,630
please.

6
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,510
She's dead!

Yingtao.

8
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,470
Go to the back door to check on that old waiter.

9
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,520
He jumped over the back wall

10
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,710
and disappeared.

11
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,470
But I saw three people

12
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,930
heading towards Mo's Inn.

They are officials.

00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,310
This...

16
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,940
Well...

17
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,800
Well...

18
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,670
As you saw,

19
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,670
it was she who suggested

20
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,950
playing something exciting.

21
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,590
The Tokhara dagger

22
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,550
also belonged to her.

23
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,400
She lost the bet

24
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,720
and got killed by the dagger.

25
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,250
It has nothing to do with me.

26
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,030
Guys,

27
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,200
we played a banned gambling game,

28
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,269
and a person ended up dead

29
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,070
in front of us.

30
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,750
If the officials look into it,

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,350
none of us

32
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,600
can get away with it.

33
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,220
What do you suggest?

34
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,090
Innkeeper.

35
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,560

Coming.

39
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,270
Coming.

40
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,280
It's snowing heavily, and the wind's howling.

41
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,740
I didn't hear you just now.

42
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,550
You are?

43
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,910
I am Long Tai.

44
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,070

I'm only drinking

48
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
but not staying over.

49
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,790
You're not staying over?

50
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,030
What? It's not allowed?

51
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,750
Do you want

52
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,680
to tell Sheriff Long what to do?

53
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,260
That's not what I mean.

54
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,670
Then what do you mean?

55
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,840
I mean

it's already late,

57

We have rooms available.

59
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,460
You can stay over.

60
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,700
I'll say it again.

61
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,150
I'm leaving

62
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,950

Got it.

65
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,070
Okay.

66
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,190
Then invite the sheriff to go in.

67
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,590
Right. This way, please.

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,690
Are you going to sleep?

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,680
I must have been blind

72
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,970
to hire you as a waiter.

73
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,909

Boss, I dare not.

81
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,260
Go get some wine.

82
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,420
I'll get some wine.

83
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,480

Distinguished guests, please go in.

85
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,670
Shouldn't you give half of the gold cake

86
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,970
to me?

87
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,810
Otherwise,

88
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,230
I'm afraid I can't stop myself from telling on you.

89
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,190
Everyone here is responsible for the woman's death.

90
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,790
Don't try to take advantage of this situation.

91
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,070
Sheriff Long,

92
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,750
did you enter the mountain late at night

93
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,670
to investigate an important case?

94
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,870
I was just passing by.

95
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,260
Passing by?

96
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,270
I'm not the local sheriff.

97
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,270
I came from Yunding County in Hanzhou,

98
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,020
and I'm going to take office in Chang'an.

99
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,860
He

100
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,020
has been appointed

101
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,220
sheriff of Wannian County in Chang'an.

102
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,630
Since you can be a sheriff in the capital,

103
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,670
you must know someone at court.

104
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,960
What do you mean?

105
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,520
You mean

106
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,330
I got my job with the help of someone else?

107
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,510
That's not what I mean.

108
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,200
I've been running this small inn

109
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,260
in this remote area

110
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,510
for many years.

111
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,950
This is the first time I've ever met

112
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,110
an official heading to the capital to take office.

113
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,909
It's truly...

114
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,300
an honor to have you here.

115
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,940
It's truly an honor.

116
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,960
Here's the wine.

117
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,450
Here. Give it to me.

118
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,310
Where are the dishes?

119
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,540
-Oh, dishes...
-Hurry.

120
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,030
We've had enough food and wine.

121
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,480
Bro, let's...

122
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,200
Let's go upstairs and rest.

123
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,190
Juzi,

124
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,790
I can't drink anymore.

125
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,110
Then let's stop drinking.

126
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,350
We're setting out early tomorrow morning.

127
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,880
Let's go.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,530
Let's go.

129
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,670
Be careful.

130
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,450
Here.

131
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,350
The dishes are here.

132
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,549
Here. Give them to me.

133
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,330
What are these?

134
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,110
You're serving the sheriff with these dishes?

135
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,910
I...

136
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,250
I only found these at the counter.

137
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Here's the thing.

138
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,550
As you saw,

139
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,670
there were many customers today.

140
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,330
They finished all the dishes.

141
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,550
How about this?

142
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,710
I'll go to the kitchen right now and look for more.

143
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,370
Please have a drink first.

144
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,990
Wait a moment.

145
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,570
It seems

146
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,350
the landlady played the gambling game

147
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,010
with the Tokhara dagger a lot.

148
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,360
But she died

149
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,430
too soon.

150
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,600
Now, a sheriff has come.

151
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,950
If the body is discovered,

152
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,950
what should we do?

153
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,270
After all, we also played a part

154
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,330
in hiding the body.

155
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,430
It has already happened,

156
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,360
so there's nothing to be afraid of.

157
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,260
However,

158
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,900
with a bunch of people staying at this ownerless inn,

159
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,100
I don't know

160
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,320
if anything else will happen tonight.

161
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,330
Don't you think

162
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,750
things tend to go wrong

163
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,070
whenever Su Wuming

164
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,950
and Lu Lingfeng are present?

165
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,150
That's true.

166
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,470
May I ask

167
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,030
your name?

168
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,240
My surname is Lu.

169
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,670
I am just a nobody,

170
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,870
so my given name is not worth mentioning.

171
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,070
You're being modest.

172
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,880
If your friend

173
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,190
hadn't posed as the innkeeper,

174
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,840
we'd...

175
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,060
Judging by the outfit

176
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,850
of the man holding a sword,

177
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,070
he probably travels around a lot

178
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,630
and wants nothing to do with the authorities.

179
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,030
That's why he suggested hiding the corpse.

180
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,140
Who would want anything to do with the authorities?

181
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,510
If it weren't for the heavy snow,

182
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,990
I wouldn't be staying

183
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,910
at this isolated inn.

184
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,250
It's already late.

185
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,710
No one else will come.

186
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,270
Close the gate.

187
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,490
You really think of me as a waiter?

188
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,930
There are chickens.

189
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,390
Let's stew a few chickens.

190
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,440
That will take a long time.

191
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,400
Those three men are obviously impatient.

192
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,470
Then... Can't we stew a few chickens

193
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,060
and eat them tomorrow morning?

194
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,720
All you think about is eating!

195
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,590
There's so much food.

196
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,750
It's enough to last dozens of people for about a month.

197
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,940
It's a natural thing

198
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,470
for an inn to store some food.

199
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
But the landlady

200
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,760
was awful.

201
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,070
She had so much food,

202
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,190
yet she said there wasn't enough food

203
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,230
because the mountain paths were snowbound,

204
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,160
and she didn't want us to stay here.

205
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,670
Fei.

206
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,350
Have some respect for the dead.

207
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,140
Let it go.

208
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,630
You're right.

209
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,230
She died of a single, fatal stab

210
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,230
at such a young age.

211
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,140
I didn't even have a chance

212
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,020
to save her.

213
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,570
How about this?

214
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,700
I'll make naan

215
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,090
and roast lamb.

216
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,020
You know how to make them?

217
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,390
Don't tell me you learned it

218
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,660
from Ma Huai in Shiyang.

219
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,620
Cut the crap.

220
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,560
Light a fire.

221
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:31,870
Go.

222
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,440
Fill it up with wine.

223
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,630
Let's bring some food later,

224
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,360
and we can drink wine on our way.

225
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,390
Do we really have to go?

226
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,150
The snow has stopped.

227
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,610
We can get back on the road.

228
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,490
But it's very late.

229
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,590
I'm so sleepy.

230
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,770
Why don't we get some sleep first?

231
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,880
I told you to get some wine.

232
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,270
Yes.

233
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,190
There's a big vat of wine over there.

234
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,720
Mr. Lu,

235
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm afraid we have to go down

236
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,830
and explain.

237
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,440
Mr. Jiang,

238
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,720
do you think we can explain?

239
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,670
No!

240
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,840
Dear guest, please don't do it yourself.

241
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,530
Let me tell you.

242
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,280
If my boss

243
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,950
sees this,

244
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,250
he will scold me again.

245
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,170
Freshly baked naan stuffed with roasted lamb.

246
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,610
Does it smell good?

247
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,190
It smells really good.

248
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,580
Then hurry up and eat it.

249
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,990
Eat it while it's hot.

250
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,430
Okay.

251
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,350
Here.

252
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,710
Please enjoy.

253
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,010
It's not bad.

254
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,030
Not bad.

255
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,230
It's really delicious.

256
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,690
I didn't lie to you, right?

257
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,370
You wanted to get some wine just now, right?

258
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,630
Let me tell you.

259
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,630
The wine in this vat is not good.

260
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,710
It was poured into the vat just 10 days ago.

261
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,960
It definitely tastes bad.

262
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,770
So, the vat should be sealed.

263
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,069
If you want wine,

264
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,910
you have to go to the counter.

265
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,130
The wines there are all aged wines.

266
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,260
Don't worry.

267
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,510
I'll fill it up for you.

268
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,339
It's delicious.

269
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,100
Uncle Fei remained calm in the face of danger.

270
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,160
He has the demeanor of a great leader.

271
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,270
Mr. Mi!

272
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,810
Landlady.

273
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,520
Landlady.

274
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,940
I'm happy tonight. I want to drink.

275
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,400
What landlady?

276
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,230
He...

277
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:21,820
Mi.

278
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,720
Why do you keep thinking about my wife?

279
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,710
Who is he?

280
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,740
What does he do?

281
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,130
Well,

282
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,310
he's a jeweler.

283
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,560
He prefers quietness,

284
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,630
so he insisted on staying in the ancestral hall.

285
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,040
I didn't agree at first.

286
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,090
But he kept pestering my wife.

287
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,030
My wife is easy to persuade.

288
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,500
So, she let him stay there.

289
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,310
It was snowing heavily.

290
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,870
My wife was worried about our children.

291
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,470
She went home to check on them.

292
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,330
She won't be back until tomorrow.

293
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,640
I'm warning you.

294
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,040
If you keep thinking about

295
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,270
and pestering my wife,

296
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,590
I'll kick you out!

297
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,760
What's this?

298
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,480
It smells so good.

299
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,270
It's freshly baked naan

300
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,330
stuffed with lamb.

301
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,310
If you want it,

302
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,550
you have to pay extra money.

303
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,510
Okay.

304
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,030
I think I'll eat it in the ancestral hall.

305
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,940
Oh.

306
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,640
Wine.

307
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,980
I want wine.

308
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,080
We have wine.

309
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,840
We have wine.

310
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,210
The wine costs extra, too.

311
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,680
Okay.

312
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,470
Okay.

313
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,620
Fei!

314
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,910
Sheriff Long,

315
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,960
the lamb tastes good, right?

316
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,090
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

317
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,190
I'm full.

318
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
That hit the spot.

319
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,350
I feel warm now.

320
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,350
And sleepy.

321
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,880
Sheriff.

322
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,870
This inn is quite clean.

323
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,500
Then you two stay here and sleep.

324
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,370
That's not what I mean.

325
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,100
Sheriff.

326
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,170
Wait for us.

327
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,550
Take the naan.

328
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,150
Okay.

329
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,350
Sheriff.

330
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,640
Fei,

331
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,470
go open the door for the sheriff.

332
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,370
Okay.

333
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,790
M-Mi Tuo was killed!

334
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,710
Blood!

335
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,510
There was blood everywhere!

336
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,070
You're not the local sheriff.

337
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,890
That's right.

338
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,550
Don't let this

339
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,480
delay your arrival at the capital.

340
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
Although I'm not the local sheriff,

341
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,160
and it's important to arrive at the capital on time,

342
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,390
it's a life that has been lost.

343
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,920
How can we not investigate?

344
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,760
Step aside.

345
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,790
Let's go.

346
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,710
Did he bring anything with him when he came?

347
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,410
He had a travel bag.

348
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,440
It was quite big.

349
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,110
Yes.

350
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,350
When he was drinking,

351
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,480
he had it on his back.

352
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,350
Why is it gone?

353
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,640
Who are you worshiping?

354
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,860
The local Mountain God.

355
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,660
Mountain God?

356
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,860
He has answered many prayers.

357
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,830
Let me ask you.

358
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,340
Why did you come to the ancestral hall

359
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,800
in the middle of the night?

360
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,150
I... I couldn't sleep.

361
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,670
I wanted to see what Mi Tuo

362
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,830
was up to.

363
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,550
He was a jeweler

364
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,540
and a Sogdian.

365
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,750
He was quite shrewd.

366
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,680
He wouldn't come

367
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,280
to this cold ancestral hall

368
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,440
for no reason.

369
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,470
So, I...

370
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,490
How come I didn't see you come out?

371
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,550
I came out through the back door.

372
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,270
The back door?

373
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,350
Then why did you

374
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,610
jump into the ancestral hall through the window?

375
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,550
I didn't want you to see me.

376
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,540
Why not?

377
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,700
I... I...

378
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,270
Tie him up.

379
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,080
Yes.

380
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,310
Sheriff! Sheriff!

381
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,790
Let me explain!

382
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,910
Sheriff!

383
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,750
Let me explain!

384
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,100
Sheriff!

385
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,230
Sheriff!

386
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,730
I think this case is easy to investigate.

387
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,510
The gate is locked,

388
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,710
and the walls are not low.

389
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,430
On such a cold, snowy day,

390
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,990
the murderer would freeze to death if he fled overnight.

391
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,790
He's probably

392
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,510
still in this inn.

393
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,490
Guards.

394
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,070
Yes.

395
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,400
Gather everyone

396
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,230
in the main hall.

397
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,070
Remember.

398
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,260
Gather everyone.

399
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,340
Yes.

400
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,070
[Good Fortune Throughout the Year]

401
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,990
What's going on here?

402
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:32,620
Well.

403
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,650
I just fell asleep.

404
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,710
What's the matter?

405
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,310
Just now,

406
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,930
Mi Tuo, the Sogdian merchant, was murdered.

407
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,550
I've examined

408
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,950
the inside and outside of the ancestral hall

409
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,750
and concluded that the murderer

410
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,710
is one of you.

411
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,840
What do you want to say?

412
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,430
What can I say?

413
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,910
Did you come to Mo's Inn

414
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,430
together with Mi Tuo?

415
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,990
Yes.

416
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,730
We first met each other in Chang'an

417
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,520
and met again at Weicheng Post.

418
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,830
He was going to Balkh,

419
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,190
and I was going to Ak-Beshim.

420
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,120
So, we decided to travel together.

421
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,790
Then did you steal

422
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,430
Mi Tuo's luggage?

423
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,990
I didn't.

424
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,170
Just now...

425
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,510
When you weren't paying attention,

426
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,510
I sneaked downstairs,

427
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,040
left through the back door,

428
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,610
and went to the ancestral hall to find Mi Tuo.

429
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,710
Sheriff Long.

430
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,510
It was me who found his body.

431
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,560
I've also proven my innocence.

432
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,650
I didn't kill him.

433
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,020
Untie me now.

434
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,150
Except for

435
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,860
the innkeeper and the waiter,

436
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,600
all of you went upstairs

437
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,950
shortly after I entered the inn.

438
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,910
The back door next to the counter

439
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,590
happened to be out of my sight.

440
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,240
Based on the timing,

441
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,430
when Mi Tuo

442
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,230
came here for wine,

443
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,100
someone slipped out through the back door

444
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,160
and sneaked into the ancestral hall.

445
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,470
When Mi Tuo returned to the ancestral hall,

446
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,800
the murderer killed him

447
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,510
and stole his luggage.

448
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,860
Who is the murderer?

449
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,730
Why don't you

450
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,530
confess?

451
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,270
Sheriff Long,

452
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,190
are you investigating the case?

453
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,460
A murder case occurred at this remote inn.

454
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,830
If I don't step up,

455
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,600
who else can we count on?

456
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,300
I was sleeping in my room the whole time.

457
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,750
It has nothing to do with me.

458
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,830
That's not

459
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,290
up to you.

460
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,670
You mean

461
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,420
that's up to you?

462
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,920
But you are not the local sheriff.

463
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,090
So what if I'm not the local sheriff?

464
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,950
As an official,

465
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,600
it is my duty to arrest criminals anytime.

466
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,410
Why are you pretending to be a swordsman

467
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,810
with a sword in your arms?

468
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,070
I think you are very suspicious.

469
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,930
Ridiculous.

470
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,160
What are you going to do?

471
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,070
Listen.

472
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,790
Don't make trouble at my inn.

473
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:00,990
Stop talking.

474
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,640
Sit down.

475
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,590
Sit down!

476
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,280
Then how can you be sure

477
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,890
that the murderer is among us?

478
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,270
It wouldn't be surprising

479
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,750
if someone from the outside

480
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,780
killed Mi Tuo and fled.

481
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,230
If it was a thief from the outside who committed the crime,

482
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,340
he wouldn't know

483
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,940
there was a person sleeping in the ancestral hall.

484
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,620
Moreover,

485
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,580
I've examined

486
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,870
the inside and outside of the inn.

487
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,700
I found no footprints

488
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,990
in the snow.

489
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,470
That means

490
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,880
no outsiders

491
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,720
entered this inn

492
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,510
after the snow stopped.

493
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,110
No wonder you got promoted to sheriff in the capital.

494
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,440
You're indeed capable.

495
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,200
You bastard!

496
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,040
Who do you think you are?

497
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,430
Who are you to comment on the sheriff?

498
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,050
Although he is your employee,

499
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,100
he is old.

500
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,060
How could you insult him?

501
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
I know I was wrong.

502
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,030
I know.

503
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,510
Now,

504
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,790
I'm going to question you one by one.

505
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,630
Of course,

506
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,530
you can also expose each other.

507
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,290
The person I point at

508
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,030
shall sit

509
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,780
on this vat.

510
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,780
Every one of you must tell me clearly

511
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,150
what you did

512
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,640
after going upstairs tonight.

513
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,130
First of all,

514
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,110
you must tell me your name,

515
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,090
where you're from,

516
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,770
what you do for a living,

517
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,680
and where you are going.

518
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,350
You go first.

519
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,900
Yes. You.

520
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,990
Go sit on the vat.

521
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,710
My name is Lu Wuming.

522
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,330
I'm from Fanyang,

523
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,810
and I live in Chang'an.

524
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,910
I'm taking my wife to Dunhuang to redeem our promise

525
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,630
to the Buddha at the Mogao Caves.

526
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,260
Your wife?

527
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,350
When I came in,

528
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,350
I saw the four of you sitting together.

529
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,550
Two men and two women.

530
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,030
Which one is your wife?

531
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,640
Then why did you

532
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,750
go into the same room

533
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,590
with him

534
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,310
instead of your wife?

535
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,640
I met this lady

536
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,470
on the way...

537
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,350
Did I ask you?

538
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,630
I met Mr. Jiang here today

539
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,920
and found him graceful and unworldly,

540
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,030
so I wanted to make friends with him.

541
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,070
We drank together

542
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,910
and had a delightful conversation.

543
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,370
We wanted to get drunk

544
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,680
and chat until dawn.

545
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,390
But then you came.

546
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,070
We didn't want to disturb you when you were drinking,

547
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,600
so we went upstairs to chat.

548
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,000
What's wrong with that?

549
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,590
You haven't told me what you do for a living.

550
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,430
I write poetry and practice martial arts.

551
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,630
Does that count as a way to make a living?

552
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,790
I'll take your word for it for now.

553
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,950
You.

554
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,990
My surname is Jiang. I'm from Hanzhou.

555
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,550
I practice self-cultivation in the mountains

556
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,610
and travel around.

557
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,910
Just as Mr. Lu said,

558
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,590
since we went upstairs,

559
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,420
we had been chatting.

560
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,360
The man holding a sword,

561
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,370
it's your turn.

562
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,770
I don't have a name.

563
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,110
I'm a swordsman wandering around the world.

564
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,240
After going upstairs,

565
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
I never came down.

566
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,650
As for the rest,

567
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,600
there's not much to say.

568
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,960
Not much to say?

569
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,860
If I find out you're lying,

570
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,270
you'll be in trouble.

571
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,640
I'm Lan Juzi.

572
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,110
I'm from Yangzhou.

573
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,110
I don't have a job.

574
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,270
I'm traveling to the west

575
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,870
just to broaden my horizons.

576
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,510
You're not a Juren.
(T/N: The Chinese characters of "Juzi" and "Juren" are the same)

577
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,710
My name is Lan Juzi.

578
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,310
Juzi is my given name.

579
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,910
After going upstairs,

580
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,840
I never came out.

581
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,580
It's too cold outside.

582
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,390
I'm Jia Buli.

583
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,750
I'm from Weizhou,

584
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,540
and I live in Chang'an.

585
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,270
I'm a jeweler.

586
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,080
As for the rest, I just told you.

587
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,700
My name is Pei Xijun.

588
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,130
I'm from Chang'an.

589
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,590
I'm going to the Mogao Caves with my husband to redeem our promise.

590
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,910
I met Yingtao on the way.

591
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,310
We became sworn sisters.

592
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,850
We stayed in the same room tonight.

593
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,380
We went to sleep as soon as we entered the room.

594
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,520
I'm Chu Yingtao.

595
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
I'm from Tanzhou.

596
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,350
My father died when I was young.

597
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,010
After that, I drifted around.

598
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,270
Fortunately, I met Xijun,

599
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,830
and we agreed to travel to the west together.

600
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,710
We stayed in the same room tonight.

601
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,240
We didn't come downstairs.

602
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,300
Innkeeper.

603
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,060
It's your turn.

604
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,870
My turn?

605
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,020
Well,

606
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,830
since Mi Tuo

607
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,590
returned to the ancestral hall

608
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,150
with wine and naan,

609
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,480
I'd been with you

610
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,640
and serving you.

611
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,080
I had no chance to commit the crime.

612
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,940
Did I say you committed the crime?

613
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,630
But don't think

614
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,440
I let you investigate with me

615
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,699
because I trusted you.

616
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,920
I was afraid you'd run away.

617
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,310
I've been investigating cases for years.

618
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,190
I've seen all kinds of murderers.

619
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,070
Perhaps you deliberately stayed with me

620
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,380
because

621
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,310
you wanted to create an opportunity

622
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,510
for your accomplice.

623
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,710
As soon as Mi Tuo came in,

624
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,480
he looked for the landlady.

625
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,159
That means

626
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,270
he was close to your wife.

627
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,310
You got suspicious and started to have bad intent.

628
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,389
You didn't dare commit the crime yourself,

629
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,790
so you hired an assassin.

630
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,409
You'd better confess now!

631
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,190
I...

632
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,659
I...

633
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,030
I knew

634
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,830
it wouldn't be so easy to make you confess.

635
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,940
Torture him in the harshest way.

636
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,380
Yes.

637
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,510
Wait a minute.

638
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,560
You're going to torture me now?

639
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,930
Then let me ask you.

640
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,800
There are

641
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,390
just a few people in this inn.

642
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,020
Tell me.

643
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,160
Which one is the assassin I hired?

644
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,870
I was bluffing.

645
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,230
Go sit on the vat!

646
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:09,750
I...

647
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,030
I have to sit on the vat, too?

648
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,040
What do you think?

649
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,390
My surname is Su.

650
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,990
M-My full name is Su Lingfeng.

651
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,900
I'm a local.

652
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,800
I used to

653
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,230
run a small business

654
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,730
in Wugong County, Yongzhou.

655
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,810
I made some money,

656
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,510
and then I returned to my hometown

657
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,780
and opened this inn.

658
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,800
An inn is for travelers to stay.

659
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,910
Yet you didn't build it by a main road

660
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,070
but in this remote place.

661
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:49,830
Why?

662
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,710
That's

663
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,190
because of you officials.

664
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,640
What do you mean?

665
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,550
The Rebellion of Queen Wei

666
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,920
was quelled several years ago.

667
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,710
But there are still some bad policies

668
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,610
that haven't been thoroughly eliminated

669
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,010
by the court.

670
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,210
In particular, ordinary people

671
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,510
have to pay too many heavy taxes!

672
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,190
For example, my inn has to pay

673
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,670
various taxes

674
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,830
every month

675
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,260
throughout the year.

676
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,110
It's the same in the first lunar month,

677
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,730
when few people go out.

678
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,270
So,

679
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,390
I opened this inn

680
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,430
in this remote area.

681
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,320
Although there are fewer guests,

682
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,830
compared to the taxes I'd otherwise have to pay,

683
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,960
it's still worth it.

684
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,710
You're evading taxes?

685
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,670
No.

686
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,400
Not exactly.

687
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,750
I still pay

688
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,510
the taxes I should pay.

689
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,390
But

690
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,830
don't expect me to pay

691
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,170
those unreasonable heavy taxes.

692
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,590
If I do,

693
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,710
I'll be...

694
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,840
I'll be giving money to corrupt officials!

695
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,750
Well said!

696
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,910
I mean

697
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,720
you spoke

698
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,710
from the heart.

699
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,310
But

700
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,200
you can only say that

701
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,430
in this remote inn.

702
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,500
Otherwise...

703
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,020
I understand.

704
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,600
Thank you for the warning.

705
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,990
Is it my turn now?

706
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,950
Don't waste our time.

707
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,510
Are you

708
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,470
looking down on me?

709
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,630
Mi Tuo's fatal injury was caused

710
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,190
by a heavy blow to the back of his head.

711
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,760
You are old.

712
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,400
I don't think you have that much strength.

713
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,100
You're so perceptive.

714
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,150
So perceptive.

715
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,190
Let me ask you.

716
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,430
Does Su

717
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,360
treat you badly?

718
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,310
He...

719
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,150
He's not bad to me.

720
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,300
He makes you dress so shabbily,

721
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,950
yet you still think he's not bad to you?

722
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,310
An employee like you

723
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,850
is really hard to find.

724
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,670
You should be cherished.

725
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,500
Su.

726
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,500
In the future,

727
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,030
you should treat this old man better.

728
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,110
Do you hear that,

729
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,150
Su... Lingfeng?

730
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,470
Well...

731
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Don't be so stingy

732
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,290
with your wine.

733
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,510
And chicken...

734
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,870
Enough.

735
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,730
I'll listen to you.

736
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,550
I'll listen to you.

737
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,840
That's more like it.

738
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,090
Except for the two women,

739
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,020
the innkeeper, and the old waiter,

740
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,390
all of you

741
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,760
come here

742
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,820
and put your right foot

743
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,670
in there.

744
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,750
You go first.

745
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,770
I have nothing to do with this, right?

746
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,900
Untie me.

747
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,710
Cut the crap.

748
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,220
I don't need to do this, right?

749
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,140
I was sleeping the whole time.

750
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,750
Come here.

751
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:40,970
Guards.

752
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,780
Yes.

753
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,950
Go search Lan Juzi's room

754
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,190
and the swordsman's room.

755
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,710
Yes.

756
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,240
On what grounds?

757
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,750
Sir,

758
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,410
the sheriff is trying to find the murderer

759
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,940
and clear everyone's name.

760
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:55,990
Don't make trouble.

761
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,590
Come here!

762
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,230
Sir,

763
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,470
take them there

764
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,600
and be a witness.

765
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,390
Okay.

766
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:06,950
Follow me.

767
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,460
Sheriff, you drew it so accurately

768
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,100
just from memory.

769
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,830
I'm impressed.

770
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,400
There are two sets of footprints here.

771
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,900
They have different sizes

772
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,670
and depths.

773
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,540
The deeper footprints

774
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,430
should be the fat man's.

775
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,350
The shallower ones

776
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,710
were probably left by the murderer.

777
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,020
There's no need to ask.

778
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,270
These were found in your room.

779
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,060
We found these

780
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,400
right under his bed.

781
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,110
I saw it with my own eyes.

782
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,100
I can testify.

783
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,580
Someone...

784
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,110
Someone...

785
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,710
Someone must have framed me!

786
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,870
The footprints match.

787
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,960
The stolen things were found in your room.

788
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,360
You still want to deny it?

789
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,950
If you still refuse to confess,

790
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,350
I'll put you through the harshest torture.

791
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,230
I'll confess.

792
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,790
I'll confess.
