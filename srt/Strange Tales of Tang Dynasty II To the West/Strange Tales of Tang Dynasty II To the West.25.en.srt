What's great about this?

It looks prosperous,

10

but it'll definitely

11
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,990
cause chaos

and more crimes.

13
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,840
Lu Lingfeng, let me ask you.

14
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,480
Who should decide

15
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,230
whether a policy is good or not?

16
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,420
Policies should be in accordance with the law

17
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,980

19
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,230
Who taught you

20
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,680
to be so smooth?

21
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,230
You can't have it both ways.

22
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,350
I think

23
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,870
the public's opinion

24
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,430
is the most important.

25
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,829
Public opinion is important,

26
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,560
but one cannot abuse power for personal gain.

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
The guy called Sima Liang

28
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,890
is the sheriff

29
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,590

may I give you

00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,120
Don't be sarcastic.

You have some honesty left in you.

128
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,110
So you saw through it from the start

129
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,990
and were testing me.

130
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,620
I shouldn't have lied.

131
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,150

You've given me the real one,

I can only pay you 100 coins.

You know what?

150
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,030
When I served as the sheriff of Wugong,

151
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,190
I always wanted to buy a Wolf Tendon

152
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,390
in case of emergency,

153
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,950
but I never bought one.

154
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,409

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,960
Soften it in water and eat it?

158
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,870
It's not for eating.

159
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,290
Let me tell you.

160
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,790
It's said that the Wolf Tendon can detect lies.

161
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,160
For example, in a theft case,

162
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,590
how do you tell

163
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,870

164
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,350
from the other suspects?

165
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,550
In this scenario,

166
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,850
you just need to burn the Wolf Tendon.

167
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,390

168
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,630

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,750

170
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,470

175
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,710
He said you're welcome.

176
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,640
Hope your mother gets better soon.

177
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,550
Hold it.

178
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,190
Sit still. It won't be long.

181
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,350
It's for a reason.

182
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,960
People here only hang out at night.

183
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,600
I want to sell portraits at the night market.

184
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,690
I'm trying it with you

185
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,310
to see how many portraits I can draw in one night.

186
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,590

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,790
Not at the night market!

194
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,070
What's wrong?

195
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,730
Who are you?

196
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,690
You broke into someone's bedroom

197
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,430
yet are asking me who I am.

198
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,970
Step aside.

199
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,600
I don't want to kill you.

200
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,760
Yunding has good wine.

201
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,570
It's easy to get drunk.

202
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,110
You must be drunk.

203
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,440
Where is that person?

204
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,510
Hand him over.

205
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,620
So you're another assassin

206
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,600
from Chang'an.

207
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,510
Tell me.

208
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,190
Who sent you here?

209
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,680
I'm not an assassin!

210
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,390
I was scared to death.

211
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,050
I woke up as soon as he came in.

212
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,420
I didn't dare to move

213
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,350
and pretended to snore.

214
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,110
I breathed a sigh of relief

215
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,470
when you came in.

216
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,260
Let me go!

217
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,470
Or send me to the government office.

218
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,470
You have no right to interrogate me!

219
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,670
Judging from your wording,

220
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,270
you're literate.

221
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,350
Then, sorry,

222
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,350
I have to show you something.

223
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,590
See it?

224
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,690
On our way here,

225
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,630
we arrested criminals and investigated cases.

226
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,760
The Imperial Censor gave us the right.

227
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,750
How dare you!

228
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,210
Were you sent from Chang'an

229
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,410
to kill Su Wuming?

230
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,950
Who hired you?

231
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,190
Tell us the truth,

232
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,150
or you'll die!

233
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,810
Interrogating me?

234
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,600
Interrogate him first!

235
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,570
Where did he get that copper coin?

236
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,390
Copper coin?

237
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,550
Don't deny it.

238
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,200
I saw it with my own eyes!

239
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,180
You mean this?

240
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:47,870
Yes.

241
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,100
Where have you

242
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
taken my brother?

243
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,350
Is he still alive?

244
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,630
Your brother?

245
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,030
Well,

246
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,750
are you sure

247
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,470
this is your brother's copper coin?

248
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,190
I'm sure.

249
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,550
Your brother is a mute?

250
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,710
You made my brother mute?

251
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,670
Sit down!

252
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,830
Sit down.

253
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,360
Let me explain it to you.

254
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,470
Sit.

255
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,710
I got this copper coin

256
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,950
when we passed Hanzhou.

257
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,510
A mute slave with distorted features

258
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,350
shoved it into my hand.

259
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,870
Distorted features?

260
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,470
Why would my brother

261
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,930
have distorted features?

262
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,950
So,

263
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,150
maybe you're mistaken.

264
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:36,990
This

265
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,070
is just an ordinary copper coin.

266
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,650
It's not special at all.

267
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,390
No.

268
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,190
Copper coins are common,

269
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,710
but the red string on that one

270
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,990
was made by my mother

271
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,420
for my brother and me before she died.

272
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,230
Reach into my pocket.

273
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,390
I have one too.

274
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,460
They're indeed the same.

275
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,470
Let me ask you.

276
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,540
What does your brother look like?

277
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,990
We look alike.

278
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,310
But

279
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,080
he has a mole between his brows.

280
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,830
That guy

281
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,720
didn't look like you.

282
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,870
But he did have a mole

283
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,290
between his eyebrows.

284
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,870
Brother.

285
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,390
How did you become mute?

286
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,470
How did you become a slave?

287
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,580
Su Wuming,

288
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,080
I remember you were very confused at that time.

289
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,410
Why did that mute slave

290
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,390
come to you and give you

291
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,710
this copper coin?

292
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,790
I remember.

293
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,110
At that moment, someone was saying

294
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,110
that I was Detective Di's disciple.

295
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,570
Detective Di's disciple?

296
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,390
Di Renjie has been dead for a long time.

297
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,450
I never heard of any of his disciples.

298
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,710
Don't be rude!

299
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,590
The two men in front of you

300
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,990
are both Detective Di's disciples.

301
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,990
Detective Di solved many strange cases.

302
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,990
He's very famous.

303
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,730
That mute slave

304
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,240
must have heard

305
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,390
Detective Di's name,

306
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,520
and that's why he gave this coin to you.

307
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,950
You have a point.

308
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,520
If that mute slave was really his brother,

309
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,820
judging from his behavior

310
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,850
and expressions,

311
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,470
he must have had an accident.

312
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,550
I guess so, too.

313
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,350
And obviously,

314
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,310
that mute slave

315
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,170
was not entirely sane.

316
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,550
I think the mention of Detective Di

317
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,430
triggered

318
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,940
some memories.

319
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,970
That's why

320
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,190
he gave me this copper coin.

321
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,630
Brother.

322
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,560
What have you

323
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,910
been through?

324
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,270
What's your brother's name?

325
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,390
Zhao Lei.

326
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,690
Lei means thunder.

327
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,620
Okay.

328
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,130
Later, I'll

329
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,950
write to Ma Meng, the Judicial Adjutant

330
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,750
of Hanzhou.

331
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,520
If that mute slave is really your brother,

332
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,850
we'll take care of him.

333
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,310
Why should I trust you?

334
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,190
Didn't you see what I showed you

335
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,230
just now?

336
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,190
To tell you the truth,

337
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,450
this gentleman

338
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,470
is the new sheriff of Yunding County,

339
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,350
Lu Lingfeng.

340
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,470
I don't buy it.

341
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,770
If you're the sheriff,

342
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,870
why are you staying in an inn?

343
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,870
I think he's not sane either.

344
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,750
Listen.

345
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,270
You don't have to believe

346
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,240
he's the sheriff.

347
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,320
But you need to tell us more

348
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,630
about you and your brother.

349
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,950
Fed.

350
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,430
Untie him.

351
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,950
Do it.

352
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,589
My name is Zhao Yu.

353
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,869
My brother and I are twins.

354
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,550
We were born on a stormy night.

355
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,290
[Zhao Yu]

356
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,140
It thundered first and then rained.

357
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,220
That's how we got our names.

358
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,839
We're from Qinzhou.

359
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,310
I practiced martial arts in my early days

360
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,550
and then traveled around.

361
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,950
My brother studied hard,

362
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,650
trying to become an official.

363
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,840
A while ago, I went back home

364
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,290
but didn't see my brother.

365
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,390
The neighbors said

366
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,980
he had left for

367
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,300
Yunding two years ago

368
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,320
to seek help from a classmate

369
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,400
called Song Shang.

370
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,150
I waited for my brother at home for half a year,

371
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,410
but he never returned,

372
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,230
so I came to Yunding to look for him,

373
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,950
only to find out that Song Shang

374
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,430
was the magistrate's assistant.

375
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,340
I was your brother's classmate,

376
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,600
but

377
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,550
I've been working here for 3 years.

378
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,810
He's never visited me.

379
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,490
Maybe he passed Yunding

380
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,160
and went straight to Shazhou.

381
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,670
They've been digging out caves in Dunhuang.

382
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,430
Zhao Lei is a Buddhist, right?

383
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,600
Have you really never seen my brother?

384
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,670
What do you mean?

385
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,960
Please don't get me wrong.

386
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,030
I'm just very worried about my brother.

387
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,020
He said

388
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,500
he was coming to you.

389
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,870
I have work to do.

390
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,490
For the sake of Zhao Lei,

391
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,190
I'll let you leave yourself.

392
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,470
You've been here for half a month.

393
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,160
Judging from what you did today,

394
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,750
you must've been investigating all along.

395
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,510
You may have gotten some clues.

396
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,070
Not yet.

397
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,600
Lu Lingfeng.

398
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,870
Yunding is not Ju County.

399
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,590
Wuming was the military commander back then.

400
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,990
He could protect you.

401
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,630
But now,

402
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,290
you are just a sheriff.

403
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,670
People around you

404
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,280
may not be so nice to you.

405
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,710
You must keep your temper.

406
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,680
Don't get provoked too easily.

407
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,270
I know you don't like me nagging.

408
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,400
I just want you

409
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,240
to be careful.

410
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,110
Don't worry.

411
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,500
I won't go to the government office alone.

412
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,630
He's going with me.

413
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,350
Su Wuming.

414
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,270
Hurry up.

415
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,150
I thought you could do it alone.

416
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,720
Lu Lingfeng,

417
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,630
why do you have to take me

418
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,090
to report to the county government with you?

419
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,540
I need to let them

420
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,680
know about you.

421
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,430
I'm a nobody,

422
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,550
just a commoner.

423
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,190
Whether they know me or not

424
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,310
is not important.

425
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,310
With the company

426
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,030
of Wuming, a nobody,

427
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,710
my nagging just now

428
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,010
was unnecessary.

429
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:52,960
Let's go.

430
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,390
Wait a moment.

431
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,550
Come here.

432
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,190
Come.

433
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,010
He spent 150 coins

434
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,330
on this?

435
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,430
Yes.

436
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,760
I was there with him.

437
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,350
I've never seen you so generous before.

438
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,310
You and I are fellow disciples.

439
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,630
You're taking office as the sheriff today.

440
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,230
As your senior,

441
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,750
I should

442
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,650
give you a little gift.

443
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,070
Can the Wolf Tendon

444
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,600
really detect lies?

445
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,590
In folk tales,

446
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,030
yes.

447
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,440
The unscrupulous even used those tales

448
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,470
to swindle money.

449
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,510
Of course.

450
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,430
The wise can make something

451
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,350
out of those tales.

452
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,270
I see.

453
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,230
Thank you.

454
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:53,080
[Yunding County Government]

455
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,550
Come on.

456
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,230
Have a seat.

457
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,030
He's here?

458
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,270
How can you fall asleep now?

459
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,590
I went to

460
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,190
the night market last night.

461
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,590
I couldn't help

462
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,320
but drink a little too much.

463
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,690
Sitting in the sun like this

464
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,690
makes me sleepy.

465
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,270
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

466
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,030
Lu Lingfeng.

467
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,870
Greetings…

468
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,510
This way.

469
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,630
Let's talk inside.

470
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,690
Let's talk inside.

471
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,950
I'm Lu Lingfeng from Fanyang.

472
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,050
I'm here to take up the post of sheriff.

473
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,450
Greetings, Magistrate.

474
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,590
Last night, while drinking,

475
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,520
I mentioned that

476
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,930
it was time for you to come.

477
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,830
Otherwise, the deadline set by the court

478
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,500
would pass.

479
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,450
Here are the imperial edict and the official certificate.

480
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,470
Lu Lingfeng from Fanyang.

481
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,150
A man…

482
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,470
A man of integrity and honor.

483
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:00,920
Sure enough.

484
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,790
You're a descendant of the Northern General of the Imperial Guards.

485
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,350
I just arrived in Yunding,

486
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,750
but I'm already aware of the local customs.

487
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,790
With due respect,

488
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,260
it's not even noon yet.

489
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,360
Why are you already drunk?

490
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,910
The magistrate loves drinking,

491
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,430
so everyone drinks,

492
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,880
which boosts the business of people in Yunding

493
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,550
who make wine for their livelihoods

494
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,510
and convinces

495
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,640
more outsiders

496
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,430
that Yunding is the county of wine.

497
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,630
As a result,

498
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,360
the wine here sells better.

499
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,460
Therefore, drinking itself

500
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,910
has become work.

501
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,350
Mr. Song knows very well

502
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,240
how to be an official in Yunding.

503
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,550
However,

504
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,330
I haven't had a chance to drink yet.

505
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,710
I'm having a hangover

506
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,790
from working too hard last night.

507
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,870
I'm Song Shang, the magistrate's assistant.

508
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,200
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lu.

509
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,720
I have a question, Mr. Song.

510
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,190
The magistrate

511
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,960
worked too hard last night

512
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,430
and couldn't come to work this morning.

513
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,030
Why were you late?

514
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,750
Mr. Lu,

515
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,630
are you blaming us for coming late?

516
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,710
Actually, you came early.

517
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,230
Yunding is the county of wine.

518
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,310
Everyone here

519
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,360
is used to drinking at night

520
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,880
and sleeping in the morning.

521
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,750
So, the county government doesn't start work

522
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,270
such that we only start working and handling affairs in the afternoon.

523
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,330
Does this comply with the imperial court's regulations?

524
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,990
Let's talk about the regulations another time.

525
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,230
Sheriff Lu,

526
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,030
ever since I learned you were coming to Yunding,

527
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,630
I have been looking forward to it day and night.

528
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,790
Our ancestors

529
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,300
had a deep relationship.

530
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,230
Your ancestors are...

531
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,290
Could it be the awe-inspiring

532
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,200
Grand Commandant Huangfu of the Later Han Dynasty?

533
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,350
Exactly!

534
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,150
My apologies, my apologies!

535
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,030
We should have a drink

536
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,370
since we met today.

537
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,590
Definitely!

538
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,630
One is a descendant of the Northern General of the Imperial Guards,

539
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,970
Lu Zhi.

540
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,530
And your ancestor was the Grand Commandant

541
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,790
Huangfu Song.

542
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,870
These are all prominent figures

543
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,790
of the Later Han Dynasty.

544
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,900
If I remember correctly,

545
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,440
back then, Grand Commandant Huangfu

546
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,570
even saved the Northern General of the Imperial Guards.

547
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,470
Sheriff Lu, oh Sheriff Lu,

548
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,440
coming to Yunding to take office,

549
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,200
you've come to the right place.

550
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,830
You are...

551
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:28,820
I am...

552
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,990
He is...

553
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,930
How should I put it?

554
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,470
He's currently my personal secretary,

555
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,950
Su–

556
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,440
No need to mention his name.

557
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,350
There's no such thing as a personal secretary.

558
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,590
I think

559
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,970
he must be a close servant

560
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,850
of Sheriff Lu.

561
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,900
He takes care of your matters along the way.

562
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,020
But now that you've arrived at Yunding,

563
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,310
it's no longer appropriate to call him a secretary.

564
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,170
It may cause misunderstandings.

565
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,510
It's better to address him as a butler.

566
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,240
Magistrate,

567
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:57,950
he...

568
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,590
Come, come, come.

569
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,100
The welcome feast is ready.

570
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,960
Let's go drink.

571
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,990
Let's go drink.

572
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,400
Let's drink!

573
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,670
Please!

574
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,030
Please.

575
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,090
-Please.
-Please.

576
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,390
He...

577
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,070
Sheriff Lu, don't worry.

578
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,190
It's normal for the butler to be standing.

579
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,910
Magistrate must think

580
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,710
it was a tiring journey for the butler too,

581
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,770
that's why he didn't ask him to leave.

582
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,390
In that case, I thank you, two sirs.

583
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,630
How about this?

584
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,550
How about I pour some wine for you three officials?

585
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,640
Sounds good.

586
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,750
Come, come, come.

587
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,440
Magistrate.

588
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,470
I'll be frank.

589
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,500
There is one thing that I do not understand.

590
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,230
That is, why did our county lift the night curfew?

591
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,590
Aren't you afraid of being faulted by the higher-ups?

592
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,150
Yunding is located at the junction where merchants must pass through

593
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,390
on the east-west trade route.

594
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,990
In order to maintain commercial prosperity,

595
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,070
we do not impose a night curfew.

596
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,230
Merchants and common people

597
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,230
are happy with it.

598
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,510
The taxes paid have doubled.

599
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,140
The city and the governor's office

600
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,400
have never particularly objected to it.

601
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,410
But since the founding of the Great Tang,

602
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,180
the night curfew has been a strict system.

603
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,750
If for the sake of

604
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,430
temporary commercial prosperity

605
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,560
this rule is broken,

606
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,550
not only will the court fault us at any time,

607
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,110
it will also give those with ulterior motives

608
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,390
an opportunity to take advantage of,

609
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,050
which will ultimately be detrimental to the safety of the people.

610
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,150
How is this exactly the same as

611
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,580
Lyu Xianke's argument.

612
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,640
Lyu Xianke?

613
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,470
He is the city's Market Supervisor.

614
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,710
He has been in charge of Yunding Market for many years.

615
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,790
He's over 70 years old, and is a man of great virtue and prestige.

616
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,310
The orderly commerce in Yunding

617
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,710
is largely thanks to him.

618
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,790
But regarding the matter of lifting the night curfew,

619
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,920
he and the former Sheriff, Sima Liang,

620
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,910
had great disagreements

621
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,370
and were even on bad terms.

622
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,150
If that's the case,

623
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,130
I should pay a visit to this Elder Lyu.

624
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,630
He's missing.

625
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,540
He's missing?

626
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,910
Yes.

627
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,070
Half a month ago.

628
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,590
I specifically held a banquet

629
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,590
just to mediate

630
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,150
the conflict between

631
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,190
Elder Lyu and Sima Liang.

632
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,940
But, the two of them each stuck to their own views

633
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,250
and argued endlessly.

634
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,230
After the banquet ended,

635
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,260
I asked Mr. Song and Sima Liang

636
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,510
to escort Elder Lyu home together.

637
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,220
No need to see me off any further.

638
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,420
Someone here holds a grudge against me.

639
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,980
[Market Supervisor: Lyu Xianke]

640
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,660
He'd want to push me

641
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,540
into a ditch.

642
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,530
We may have different opinions,

643
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,920
but that doesn't prevent me from respecting the elderly and caring for the young.

644
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,840
I am not

645
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,510
that petty.

646
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,110
You...

647
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,710
Both of you, say no more.

648
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,550
Besides,

649
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,520
Elder Lyu,

650
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,710
with your unsteady steps,

651
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,580
we must escort you all the way home.

652
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,530
No need!

653
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,790
The new sheriff sent by the imperial court

654
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,310
is already on his way.

655
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,330
Sima Liang,

656
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,310
do you know why the imperial court

657
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,630
is replacing you?

658
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,790
It's nothing more than the fact that

659
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,750
I engage in business and sell alcohol.

660
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,750
Wrong!

661
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,160
It's because you advocate for

662
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,830
lifting the night curfew,

663
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,860
It's against the rules!

664
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,750
-That doesn't matter.
-Do you understand?

665
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,790
I don't care

666
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,850
about the mere position of a sheriff.

667
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,350
You arrogant fool!

668
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,500
Sooner or later, you'll get what's coming to you!

669
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,390
Darn old bastard.

670
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,350
Watch out or you might fall and die!

671
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,470
Arrogant fool!

672
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,730
Take care, Elder Lyu!

673
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,700
It's my fault.

674
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,150
For not escorting him home.

675
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,390
Now he's missing.

676
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,750
The city's Market Supervisor,

677
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,770
though not an official role of the county government,

678
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,700
he an important figure in Yunding.

679
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,880
His disappearance is no small matter.

680
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,940
Although Sima Liang was dismissed from his post,

681
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,590
before I took office

682
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,630
he was still acting as the sheriff.

683
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,780
He didn't investigate this case?

684
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
He investigated.

685
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,360
But I bet he didn't look into it carefully.

686
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,020
Mr. Song.

687
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,650
Today we're drinking a welcome toast today.

688
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Let's discuss these matters later.

689
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,540
Welcome to Yunding, Sheriff Lu.

690
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,350
From now on

691
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,860
the three of us

692
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,510
must support each other through thick and thin!

693
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:08,990
Cheers!

694
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,550
Welcome, Sheriff Lu!

695
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,470
Come on!

696
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,430
I invited you, Officer Suo, for a drink today

697
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,630
to reminisce about our brotherly bond.

698
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,030
Sheriff Sima,

699
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,790
you calling me "Officer"

700
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,320
sends a chill down my spine.

701
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,960
Then what should I call you?

702
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,160
Same as before,

703
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,800
just call me Longzi.

704
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,710
Can I call you Longzi,

705
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,130
but you can't call me Sheriff anymore!

706
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,530
From now on,

707
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,630
I'll call you Mr. Sima.

708
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,240
Then I'll call you brother.

709
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,550
I will always be your brother.

710
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,070
About that matter...

711
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,910
Rest assured.

712
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,230
I've looked for everyone in the county government

713
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,390
who ranked below me.

714
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,710
Lu

715
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,070
won't know anything.

716
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,870
Thank you

717
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,190
so much.

718
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,990
You treating me to a drink

719
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,030
is the greatest honor

720
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,900
for me.

721
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,150
How could I let you

722
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,190
thank me?

723
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:12,950
Song Shang.

724
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,270
Prepare everything for Mr. Lu

725
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,390
in Yunding.

726
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,830
Rest assured, Magistrate.

727
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,860
Then I shall take my leave.

728
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,420
Your residence

729
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,530
has been arranged.

730
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,330
It's enough for you and your servant to stay.

731
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,430
It's not just

732
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,590
me and Su Wuming who came to Yunding this time.

733
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,870
There are a total of five people.

734
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,600
Five people?

735
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,210
That's just perfect!

736
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,270
What I have prepared is

737
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,950
the mansion where Elder Lyu used to live in.

738
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,880
It's big enough!

739
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,350
Isn't this inappropriate?

740
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,750
You are unaware.

741
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,390
That mansion previously

742
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,790
belonged to a foreign merchant.

743
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,070
Because he committed a crime,

744
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,200
it was confiscated.

745
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,100
Elder Lyu was also just staying there temporarily.

746
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,150
Now that he has been missing for over half a month,

747
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,670
the mansion has been vacant.

748
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,930
It's perfect for you to be staying there.

749
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,510
Please go and have a look first

750
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,590
If you are not satisfied,

751
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,390
we can change.

752
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,510
Su Wuming.

753
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,170
Go and check out the mansion with Mr. Song first.

754
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,640
I will go to the Western Office to handle some affairs first.

755
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,150
You just started your term here,

756
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,550
and you're already going to the Western Office to handle affairs.

757
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,780
I admire you.

758
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,310
Butler.

759
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,910
I heard Sheriff Lu call you

760
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,920
Su Wuming.

761
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,510
That is my name.

762
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,150
This name sounds a bit familiar.

763
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,160
Could it be cause it sounds mundane?

764
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,710
You look like a scholar

765
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,710
but you are too unambitious.

766
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,270
Isn't studying

767
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,360
all for passing the imperial exams

768
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,090
and making a name for yourself?

769
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,070
With a name like Wuming which means nameless,

770
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,030
so you can only

771
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,300
be someone's butler.

772
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,670
You are right.

773
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,640
I have no great ambitions.

774
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,510
Being able to serve as Sheriff Lu's housekeeper

775
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,380
[Nan’s Tavern]

776
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,630
is already more than I could ask for.

777
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,650
Is there anything else?

778
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:34,350
[Righteous and Diligent]

779
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,590
Sheriff,

780
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,750
all the old case files are here.

781
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,680
The Yunding County is huge.

782
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,430
There are only these few cases?

783
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,030
Moreover,

784
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,480
they are all just cases of petty theft.

785
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,120
Where is the officer?

786
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,030
Well, well... He hasn't arrived yet.

787
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,670
Look at the time.

788
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,140
Please calm down, Sheriff.

789
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,350
It's mainly because he didn't know that today,

790
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,100
you are taking office as the new official.

791
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,140
What do you mean?

792
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,470
If I weren't taking office,

793
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,870
could he simply not come?

794
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,790
I'm here!

795
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,670
The new Sheriff is here?

796
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,430
Where is he?

797
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,250
Here.

798
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,150
I am the officer of Yunding County, Suo Long.

799
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,590
[Officer: Suo Long]

800
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,240
Nice to meet you.

801
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,760
May I have your surname, Sheriff?

802
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,010
Fanyang's Lu Lingfeng.

803
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,860
The Lu family of Fanyang.

804
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,230
From Hanzhou to Dunhuang,

805
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,360
including Yunding,

806
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,210
only the natives are important.

807
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,590
If you are from Benzhou,

808
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,870
it's only worth mentioning if you're from

809
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,909
the six prestigious clans,

810
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,570
Jia, Liao, Yin, Suo, Shi and An

811
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,550
Othweise,

812
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,730
other surnames don't carry much weight.

813
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,330
So Sheriff, when you are in Yunding,

814
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,170
there's no need to mention Fanyang.

815
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,070
Let me ask you.

816
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,170
Would you rather be Yelang

817
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,330
or the frog in the well?

818
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,840
I choose the frog...

819
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,230
Sheriff Lu,

820
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,429
you laid a trap for me.

821
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,469
Officer, Officer.

822
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,070
It refers to someone who is older,

823
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,350
is familiar with the county government,

824
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,880
and is in charge of arrests.

825
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,280
At your age...

826
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,480
Oh right.

827
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,040
Your surname is Suo.

828
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,550
A local prestigious clan.

829
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,110
You became an officer

830
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,560
because of your family's power, right?

831
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,220
It was with my own abilities!

832
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,990
The county government only has these few case files

833
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,990
and no old cases.

834
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,480
From this perspective

835
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,790
you and the former sheriff, Sima Liang,

836
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,710
have both done your job.

837
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,810
Of course.

838
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,630
How is your reputation among the constables

839
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,230
and runners?

840
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,010
Within an hour,

841
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,630
gather all the constables

842
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,270
and runners on duty

843
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,110
over here.

844
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,170
regardless of where they are.

845
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,660
What are you trying to do?

846
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,030
When the former sheriff gave orders,

847
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,890
would you question him like this?

848
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,550
This is the place.

849
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,750
If there are any of Elder Lyu's belongings inside,

850
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,630
gather them into

851
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,790
a single room.

852
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,270
Thank you, Mr. Song.

853
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,890
By the way, Butler.

854
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,460
How long have you been

855
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,520
with Sheriff Lu?

856
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,730
It's been quite some time.

857
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,910
You served as his family's servant?

858
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,630
I heard that

859
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,660
when he was a General of the Imperial Guards,

860
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,390
he was deeply entrusted by the Crown Prince at that time,

861
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,070
who is now the Emperor.

862
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,190
That is indeed true.

863
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,800
Then why is he demoted?

864
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,680
As for the details,

865
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,030
I'm but a mere butler,

866
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,050
I wouldn't know.

867
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,140
However...

868
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,240
However what?

869
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,110
However, during this westward journey,

870
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,450
Sheriff Lu has been in very good spirits

871
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,110
and often laughing heartily.

872
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,520
When passing through Hanzhou,

873
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,790
Commander Lu Si'an

874
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,090
even specially hosted a banquet for him.

875
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,150
I wasn't allowed to accompany them at that time

876
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,900
But when Grand Commander Lu saw him off,

877
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,950
he kept entreating Sheriff Lu,

878
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,590
asking Sheriff Lu

879
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,190
to put in a few good words for him

880
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,210
in front of His Majesty when he returns to the capital.

881
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,870
I get it now.

882
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,070
I get it now!

883
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,270
His Majesty must've

884
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,550
sent him to Yunding to gain experience.

885
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,200
In the future...

886
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,870
I think so.

887
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,590
Thank you, Butler Su

888
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,120
for revealing so much to me.

889
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,190
I can't, I can't.

890
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,830
Take this.

891
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,830
If you encounter anything in Yunding,

892
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,750
just tell me.

893
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,660
Including your own matters.

894
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,440
I also serve as the Market Overseer of this county.

895
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,360
If you want to do some

896
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,660
small business or something,

897
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,460
it can be done.

898
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,910
It can be done.

899
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,390
Sheriff.

900
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,750
Hows this?

901
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,640
In less than an hour,

902
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,680
you've gathered everyone.

903
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,440
Officer Suo,

904
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,310
you're quite something.

905
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,270
Get back to your work.

906
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,150
What?

907
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,880
Lu Lingfeng,

908
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,350
you're deliberately messing with me?

909
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,870
Why?

910
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,870
Don't I, the sheriff, have this authority?

911
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,040
The imperial court sent you to be the sheriff.

912
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,930
You have the power to order me around.

913
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,470
But if you're messing with me,

914
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,290
aren't you afraid you'll have a bad time in Yunding?

915
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,190
Let me apologize to you then.

916
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,110
Enough!

917
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,150
I don't need your apology.

918
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,390
Then what should I do?

919
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,230
I want to see

920
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,150
if you, as the sheriff,

921
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,950
are competent for the job or not.

922
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,400
What do you mean?

923
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,530
As the official in charge of catching thieves,

924
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,730
you need to be able to catch the thieves.

925
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,730
There are many thieves skilled in martial arts.

926
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,010
Sheriff Lu.

927
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,220
We all doubt

928
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,580
if you're up to the task.

929
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,670
You all doubt me?

930
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,190
But whether I'm capable or not

931
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,870
is not for me to say, right?

932
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,910
Then let me, Suo Long,

933
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,710
test you out on behalf of the brothers.

934
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,320
Officer Suo.

935
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,310
You can't do this.

936
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:29,970
Step aside.

937
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,710
If you insist,

938
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,150
then bring it on.

939
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,470
Enough!

940
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,490
With your skill level,

941
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,350
you're not even worthy of sparring with me.

942
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,280
What did you say?

943
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,230
I think you're just afraid of embarrassing yourself

944
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,360
cause you can't win.

945
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,710
Sheriff Lu!

946
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,710
Spare my life!

947
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,350
Spare me!

948
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,440
I was blind!

949
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,310
Blind!

950
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,070
-Bro!
-Officer Suo!
-Officer!

951
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,550
Are you all right?

952
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,880
-Slowly.
-Are you okay?

953
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,030
Let me ask you.

954
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,430
Am I worthy?

955
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,310
Yes...

956
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,390
Yes!

957
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,710
What about you guys?

958
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,830
Yes!

959
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,470
Then hurry up and stand in formation!

960
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,710
Line up, line up.

961
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,190
Line up, line up, quickly.

962
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,430
There's something I want to ask.

963
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,040
After taking office today,

964
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,470
I saw the number of case files at the county government

965
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,060
was no more than 10 in total.

966
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,990
Based on my previous experience,

967
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,750
for a county,

968
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:43,990
especially for

969
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,910
a large county at a strategic location

970
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,710
like Yunding,

971
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,110
to only have these few case files

972
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,430
is very unusual.

973
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,470
Let me ask you

974
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,390
are there really only these few case files

975
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,990
in the country government?

976
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,530
You, speak.

977
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,560
It's really just these.

978
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,800
Then you tell me,

979
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,390
are there case files

980
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,650
stored anywhere else?

981
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,510
N-No.

982
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,310
No.

983
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,390
No.

984
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:32,990
Sheriff Lu.

985
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,350
I'm in charge of guarding

986
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,410
the old case files.

987
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,230
Didn't I tell you before?

988
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,520
That's all we have.

989
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,550
Suo Long.

990
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,270
It seems you're not only good at your job,

991
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,230
you're also quite influential

992
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,760
in this county government.

993
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,190
Since none of you are telling the truth,

994
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:04,910
I'll have no choice but to

995
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,670
invite him.

996
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,890
This thing is called Wolf Tendon.

997
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,590
Wolves

998
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,310
generally live around 15 years.

999
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,020
But if you get

1000
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,830
the leg tendon

1001
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,250
from a 20-year-old wolf,

1002
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,030
it's a treasure.

1003
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,790
By smoking this item,

1004
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,350
I can tell

1005
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,110
who's lying.

1006
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:34,850
Sheriff Lu,

1007
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,710
don't scare us.

1008
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,750
We're all honest people.

1009
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,950
You don't believe it?

1010
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,030
After all, Yunding is remote after all.

1011
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,870
You probably haven't even heard of the legends

1012
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,400
from Chang'an and Luoyang.

1013
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,530
Back when Detective Di was solving cases,

1014
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,860
he once used this object

1015
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,120
to uncover the thief in the palace.

1016
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,870
How could you know

1017
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,390
things of the palace?

1018
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,720
I am untalented,

1019
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,130
but I am indeed Detective Di's disciple.

1020
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,350
Detective Di has been dead for so many years

1021
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,500
yet you claim to be his disciple at this age.

1022
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,670
Who would believe that?

1023
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,700
Believe it or not.

1024
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,430
I will now smoke this item.

1025
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,230
The liar's lips will twitch

1026
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,870
uncontrollably.

1027
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,280
As to whether I am Detective Di's disciple or not,

1028
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,610
you will naturally know

1029
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,670
after the lie detection.

1030
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:22,870
You!

1031
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,550
You!

1032
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,150
And you!

1033
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,270
You!

1034
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,190
You.

1035
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,590
Step ahead.
