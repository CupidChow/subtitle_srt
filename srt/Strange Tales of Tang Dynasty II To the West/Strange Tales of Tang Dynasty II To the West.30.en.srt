4
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,940
Let me go!

5
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,289
Help!

6
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,920
Help!

7
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,310
Save me!

8
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,990
Save me!

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,600
Someone, please save me!

10
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,810
Heroine!

11
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,920
Hurry and save me!

12
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,810
Is Qing Xi here?

13
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,230
Qing Xi?

14
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,829
Her.

15
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,370
I think it's her!

16
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,670
At the tattooist's place,

17
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,270
I saw her.

18
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,060
Calm down.

19
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,530
I will save you all.

20
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,510
Spare... spare my life!

21
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,600
You're really good at hiding.

22
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,110
Listen.

23
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,990
People can be brought out of this coffin

24
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,910
every day.

25
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:00,590
Get up!

26
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,040
I was blinded by greed.

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,840
But I still have an old mother at home

28
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,580
and a baby to feed.

29
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,280
Please let me go this time.

30
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,150
Spare me.

31
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,380
I won't kill you,

32
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,750
but from now on,

33
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,550
you won't be yourself anymore.

34
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,270
What mother and baby?

35
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,320
Forget them.

36
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,390
No.

37
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,190
Go.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,560
-No!
-You won't be yourself anymore?

39
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,420
Spare me!

40
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,350
Mute slaves?

41
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,530
Please spare me!

42
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,680
Please spare me!

43
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,320
Get up.

44
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,030
You two,

45
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,030
leaving so soon?

46
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,620
There's one more.

47
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,640
Where were you hiding just now?

48
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,790
That is

49
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,190
none of your business.

50
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,110
Let me ask you two,

51
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,310
if it's for the reward money,

52
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,950
haven't I already earned it?

53
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,810
You two couldn't find me just now.

54
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,030
But that little reward money

55
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,829
means nothing to me.

56
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,150
I came here this time

57
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,630
to see Lyu Xianke.

58
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,820
Don't tell me he's not here.

59
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,910
Unless

60
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,590
you two are just small fries

61
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,950
who can't even meet this Immortal Steps leader.

62
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,550
That's enough.

63
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,100
Take him out.

64
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,480
Put him in the wind box.

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,230
Blow the wind at him for a longer time.

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,870
Then his facial features

67
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,040
will not easily return to their original state.

68
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,110
Master.

69
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,880
Someone is here.

70
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,910
They can call out my name?

71
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,550
Yes.

72
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,750
Looks like a scholar?

73
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,750
Who is it?

74
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,760
Bring him up.

75
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,790
Yes.

76
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,390
Spare me...

77
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,430
Go!

78
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,020
How could this happen?

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,440
First, marinate them in wine.

80
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,400
Then apply magical techniques

81
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,450
to distort the person's facial features.

82
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,480
The resulting mute slave will be unrecognizable.

83
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,630
Elder Lyu Xianke.

84
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,120
You have impressive skills.

85
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,790
You are truly a guest from the immortal realm.

86
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,240
You actually know my name.

87
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,659
[Leader of Yunding Immortal Steps, Lyu Xianke]

88
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,950
Who are you?

89
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,120
I am Su Wuming.

90
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,180
Su Wuming.

91
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,560
I've heard passing merchants mention you

92
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,630
and that Lu Lingfeng.

93
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,000
They say you are Detective Di's disciples

94
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,450
and quite capable.

95
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,680
I didn't want to cause trouble,

96
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,430
so I actively hid from you.

97
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,140
But I didn't expect

98
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,030
that within a few days of you arriving in Yunding,

99
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,430
you'd get closer and closer to me.

100
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,110
In that case,

101
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,190
you deliberately disappeared

102
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,390
in order to

103
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,390
escape our sight.

104
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,790
Indeed.

105
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,910
But you still found me.

106
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,940
I heard you are just

107
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,690
Lu Lingfeng's strategist,

108
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,010
a mere scholar.

109
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,460
Have you come to die?

110
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,470
I have a natural curiosity

111
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,640
for strange things.

112
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,400
If I didn't come see with my own eyes,

113
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,550
how'd I know

114
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,920
the origins of these Yunding mute slaves?

115
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,470
There's just one thing I don't understand.

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,230
Wasn't Zhao Lei from Qinzhou

117
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,280
your associate?

118
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,240
Why did he also become a mute slave?

119
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,550
Zhao Lei.

120
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,030
Two years ago,

121
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,550
he came to Yunding.

122
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,310
On account of being schoolmates with Song Shang

123
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,980
and having a glib tongue,

124
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,850
he played the former magistrate

125
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,910
like a fiddle.

126
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,750
The magnificent building

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,720
I personally designed,

128
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,150
which cost the lives of my two sons to build,

129
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,270
became his Yunding Immortal Steps!

130
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,940
I pretended to cooperate with him

131
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,670
and even spent a lot of money.

132
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,070
Until half a year ago,

133
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,670
when I felt I no longer needed him,

134
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,870
I threw him into the wine pool.

135
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,919
To think he didn't drown,

136
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,830
die of thirst,

137
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,850
or starve to death,

138
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,409
but just

139
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,510
became stupid

140
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,870
and mute.

141
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,370
So I used bone-kneading techniques

142
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,460
to change his appearance

143
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,500
and made him the first

144
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,540
Yunding mute slave.

145
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,990
I understand.

146
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,670
And then the hunting game

147
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,340
turned into a slave-hunting game.

148
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,970
All the participants

149
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,750
were made into Yunding mute slaves.

150
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,510
Yunding mute slaves

151
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,280
are in short supply.

152
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,070
Who doesn't want to make a fortune?

153
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,810
I'm also preparing a batch of

154
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,660
Yunding female slaves.

155
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,380
Each and every one of them has been

156
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,630
carefully selected by the body artist.

157
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,490
Think about it.

158
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,520
A beautiful woman who doesn't talk.

159
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,710
She'll do whatever

160
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,930
you tell her to.

161
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,370
Isn't 100,000 coins

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,240
for such a female slave

163
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,990
a great deal?

164
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,830
This indeed satisfies men's desires.

165
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,460
They must sell well.

166
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,300
But Elder Lyu,

167
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
you are already so old

168
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,990
and your sons have died.

169
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,910
What do you need so much money for?

170
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,350
So what if I'm old?

171
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,630
Look at this.

172
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,140
Do you know why those mute slaves

173
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,620
become mute and stupid?

174
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,630
Because their souls

175
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,170
have been extracted by me.

176
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,180
This is

177
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,580
where the extracted souls are.

178
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,150
As long as I collect

179
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,250
the souls of 1,000 people

180
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,350
and consume them all at once,

181
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,150
I can

182
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,270
achieve immortality.

183
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,820
Master.

184
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,960
Don't bother explaining it to him!

185
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,360
I have one more thing to ask.

186
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,990
Go on.

187
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,470
Every day, there are those who

188
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,600
emerge victorious in the hunting game

189
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,530
and receive reward money.

190
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,120
Could it be that

191
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,870
they are all your subordinates

192
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,940
in disguise?

193
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,310
Of course.

194
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,630
Otherwise, how could there be an endless stream

195
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,890
of people coming to the door every night?

196
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,870
Elder Lyu, you're truly brilliant.

197
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,870
Stop flattering me.

198
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,300
Soon,

199
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,230
I will have you

200
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,670
slide down

201
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,240
from this high place

202
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,950
into my wine pool

203
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,210
like a dream.

204
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,590
After being carefully marinated

205
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,460
and fished out,

206
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,870
I'll personally knead your bones.

207
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,480
A mute slave made from Director Di's disciple.

208
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,470
How much should I sell you for?

209
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,110
200,000?

210
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,760
No.

211
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,670
I want to keep you by my side for my own use.

212
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,600
If that's the case,

213
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,430
I thank you, Elder Lyu.

214
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,190
Is this guy an idiot?

215
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,070
Please don't make fun of me, brothers.

216
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,070
I was ostracized,

217
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
schemed against,

218
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,590
and had no choice but to flee Chang'an

219
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,190
to get to Yunding.

220
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,610
On the way here,

221
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,750
there were three waves of assassins trying to kill me.

222
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,510
Every day I'm like a traumatized bird,

223
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,210
like a dog who lost his master.

224
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,830
Even though I was

225
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,830
apprenticed to Detective Di,

226
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,270
I've accomplished nothing.

227
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,800
I've drifted through life

228
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,910
and yet to make a name for myself.

229
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,910
I've aroused jealousy

230
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,190
and hatred.

231
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,560
So many people

232
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,220
want me dead.

233
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,190
My life's so bitter!

234
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,910
Today,

235
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,870
upon meeting you, Elder Lyu,

236
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,950
I felt an extraordinary affinity with you

237
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,550
and great admiration for you.

238
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,610
Would you accept me as your disciple?

239
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,240
Your unique skill of creating mute slaves

240
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,390
needs a successor after all.

241
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,960
That's not a bad idea,

242
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,250
but you're trying to deceive me.

243
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,150
I won't fall for it.

244
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,910
I don't want to see this person anymore.

245
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,940
Throw him into the wine pool.

246
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,960
Wait.

247
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,360
Throwing me into the wine pool

248
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,800
to become a mute slave

249
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,740
would actually put an end to

250
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,550
my many troubles in this life.

251
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,230
Elder Lyu.

252
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,540
Please accept one more kowtow

253
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,900
from me.

254
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,430
The wrath of a scholar

255
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,160
makes him desperate and decisive!

256
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,670
You old villain,

257
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,910
you underestimated me, didn't you?

258
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,550
You two,

259
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,030
put down your blades.

260
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,080
Or I'll

261
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,510
slit his throat now!

262
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,770
Bravo.

263
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,600
Bravo.

264
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,440
Kill him right away!

265
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,580
Then

266
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,270
Yunding Immortal Steps

267
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,020
will be mine,

268
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,990
just mine.

269
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,110
Yulang,

270
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,540
what are you talking about?

271
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,470
Hurry and save me, your godfather!

272
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,490
I only called you Godfather

273
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,910
because you were rich

274
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,550
and had power in Yunding.

275
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,110
But now,

276
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,990
you can die.

277
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,840
You fake eunuch!

278
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,620
How dare you betray me?

279
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,430
Of course I'm fake.

280
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,780
It was you, Song Shang, and Zhao Lei

281
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,590
who colluded

282
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,110
and forced me to impersonate a eunuch,

283
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,350
forge letters,

284
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,770
and trick that foolish magistrate.

285
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,990
Besides,

286
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,200
I originally came here

287
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,000
with Zhao Lei.

288
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,660
This is

289
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,840
no betrayal.

290
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,640
What are you all standing there for?

291
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,220
Kill He Yulang!

292
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,630
Godfather,

293
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,550
you old fool,

294
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,960
can't you see that

295
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,570
in Yunding Immortal Steps now,

296
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,990
the Red Robes

297
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,230
and Green Robes

298
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,700
are all my trusted men?

299
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,150
Thirteen Lethal Guardians

300
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,990
are also

301
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,310
my friends in the martial arts world.

302
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,170
Oh right,

303
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,270
and them too.

304
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,580
Master.

305
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,070
Yulang.

306
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,710
I-I have always

307
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,510
meticulously nurtured you,

308
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,270
entrusting you with great responsibilities.

309
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,750
How could you betray me?

310
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,590
You

311
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,000
are getting old.

312
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,910
You can't do things yourself anymore,

313
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,920
so you wanted

314
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,680
someone to help you do the work.

315
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,400
But you're a paranoid person by nature.

316
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,530
You didn't trust me,

317
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,460
so you used your power to test me.

318
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,390
You even got two people

319
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,110
to monitor me.

320
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,990
At that point,

321
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,620
if I didn't do something,

322
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,460
how could I live up

323
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,180
to your test?

324
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,930
Disloyal...

325
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,950
Disloyal scum!

326
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,030
I'm disloyal?

327
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,510
Well, I

328
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,630
learned it from you.

329
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,380
And you, Su Wuming,

330
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,980
you're truly cunning.

331
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,660
That move you just pulled,

332
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,140
playing dumb to take advantage of him,

333
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,670
was absolutely brilliant.

334
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,510
Kill him.

335
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,310
Slit his throat.

336
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,550
Kill him!

337
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,670
Can't bear to do it?

338
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,830
Then you two can go down together.

339
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,660
After some time,

340
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,910
I'll come knead your bones

341
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,860
and personally turn you two

342
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,010
into a pair of old mute slaves for Yunding!

343
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,710
Su Wuming?

344
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,599
Fed!

345
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,150
I finally found you.

346
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,540
I ended up here

347
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,270
because I'm a drunkard.

348
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,350
But Su Wuming, why are you also...

349
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,410
I'm here to save you.

350
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,390
Thank god.

351
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,670
Didn't you also fall in here?

352
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,000
How can you save me then?

353
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,110
If I can't save you,

354
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,790
I'll die with you.

355
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,460
Soaking here for so long,

356
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,130
how are you still so sober,

357
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,560
unlike them?

358
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,160
Isn't it because of that...

359
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,500
Sobering Pearl?

360
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,860
Zhao Yu.

361
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,790
Come here.

362
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,920
Spit it out quickly.

363
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,470
Mr. Su.

364
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,000
I didn't listen to the advice.

365
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,460
I'm afraid I'll end up like

366
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,090
my brother.

367
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,710
Quick, hold it in your mouth for a while,

368
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,390
or you'd pass out later.

369
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,260
Zhao Yu.

370
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,780
It's that man.

371
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,190
He was the one

372
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,230
who turned your brother Zhao Lei

373
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,910
into a mute slave.

374
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,030
You old villain!

375
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,690
You old bastard!

376
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,140
Please don't kill me.

377
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,270
I'll beat you.

378
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,310
I'll beat you to death!

379
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,990
You old villain.

380
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,450
I'll kill you.

381
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,440
Alright.

382
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,460
Enough.

383
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,990
You old villain.

384
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,310
You wanted to use such a method

385
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,850
to steal people's souls.

386
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,760
How delusional

387
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,060
and utterly absurd!

388
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,990
What do you know?

389
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,230
Put it in your mouth now,

390
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,510
or you'd pass out in a bit.

391
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,470
That is...

392
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,400
Old fool.

393
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,550
Depending on this for immortality?

394
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,980
In your dreams.

395
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,670
I, Yunding's sheriff Lu Lingfeng,

396
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,160
am ordering to seal off Yunding Immortal Steps.

397
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,880
Surrender now or else!

398
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,480
Brothers, get them.

399
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,800
If they stubbornly resist,

400
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,640
kill them!

402

What?

423
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,000
Impossible.

424
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,340
It's true.

425
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,770
Come see for yourself.

426
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,110
What a timely arrival.

427
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,450
Since you're here,

428
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,990
I'll make sure

429
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,170
you won't leave alive.

430
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,810
You bunch of desperados.

431
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,270
I've long figured out

432
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,790
each of your backgrounds.

433
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,920
You're either bandits or thieves,

434
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,070
each having committed a capital crime.

435
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,600
Now you're hiding in Yunding Immortal Steps,

436
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,710
calling yourselves the Thirteen Lethal Guardians.

437
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,430
Today,

438
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,510
your good days are over.

439
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,250
Drop your weapons and surrender now!

440
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,930
I'm Yunding's sheriff Lu Lingfeng!

441
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,590
Hand over your ringleader.

442
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,590
Those who surrender will be spared!

443
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,990
I'll shoot Lu Lingfeng dead.

444
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,880
I'll shoot the Yunding sheriff dead.

445
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,510
Sima!

446
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,590
Sheriff Sima!

447
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,490
Sheriff Sima.

448
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,930
Sima Liang?

449
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,490
How's your injury?

450
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,190
Sheriff Lu.

451
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,710
Stay focused.

452
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,220
S-Slay demons and eliminate evil.

453
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,330
Bring me my rake.

454
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,420
Master!

455
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,530
Those inside, watch out.

456
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,270
Sima.

457
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,070
Sima.

458
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,660
[Tomb of Sima Liang, a Tang official]

459
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,970
I, Sima Liang,

460
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,790
abolished night curfews,

461
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,920
allowing the people

462
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,350
and trade to prosper.

463
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,040
This is my greatest achievement in my twelve years as an official.

464
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,590
I heard the court has issued Yunding

465
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,820
a secret decree.

466
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,360
What is written on it?

467
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,340
Do you really need to know?

468
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,840
Lu Lingfeng.

469
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,130
It's not just Brother.

470
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,410
We all want to know.

471
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,710
Lu Lingfeng, Deputy President of the Supreme Court,

472
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,270
has become arrogant due to his achievements,

473
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,370
to the point of negligence.

474
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,300
Therefore, he is demoted to be Yunding's sheriff in Hanzhou

475
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,940
to temper his character.

476
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,350
If he devotes himself to self-improvement,

477
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,640
he only needs to be spurred on.

478
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,100
If he remains reckless and presumptuous...

479
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,690
Lu Lingfeng,

480
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,800
read the rest yourself.

481
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,240
If he remains reckless and presumptuous,

482
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,770
acts beyond his authority,

483
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,300
or even slanders the court,

484
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,030
he'll be dismissed on the spot

485
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,890
and escorted back to the capital.

486
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,830
Those who influence him

487
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,070
by his side,

488
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,550
such as Su Wuming,

489
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,660
will be executed on the spot.

490
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,030
There's even such a secret decree.

491
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,790
I, Su Wuming, am really somebody.

492
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,110
Even the current Emperor

493
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,490
has been thinking of me all along.

494
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,260
There are quite a few strange things

495
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,070
in Yunding.

496
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,550
In order to establish Immortal Steps,

497
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,980
the Prime Minister's secret letter,

498
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,990
the Commander's letter,

499
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,390
and whatnot are all fake.

500
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,710
It's even hard to tell

501
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,720
if this secret decree real.

502
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,590
You don't need to comfort me.

503
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,270
It's a good thing to be remembered by the Emperor.

504
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,910
I feel very relieved.

505
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,670
However,

506
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,370
Lu Lingfeng, oh, Lu Lingfeng.

507
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,270
Compared to when

508
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,390
I first met you in Chang'an

509
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,710
years ago,

510
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,750
you've completely transformed.

511
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,860
Why do you say that?

512
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,310
If you acted on impulse,

513
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,230
you'd be immediately removed from your official position.

514
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,310
You'd also lose

515
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,350
the power to command the constables.

516
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,470
Without manpower,

517
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,180
taking down Yunding Immortal Steps

518
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,330
would've just been a pipe dream.

519
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,930
We couldn't have saved Fed either.

520
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,220
I, Su Wuming,

521
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,780
would've also been beheaded.

522
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,440
But this forbearance of yours

523
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,740
is the perfect strategy.

524
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,240
You endured well

525
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,790
and brilliantly.

526
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,840
I admire you greatly.

527
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,320
Lu Lingfeng.

528
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,640
I wronged you the other day.

529
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,310
But

530
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,050
it's true that if we were a step later,

531
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,910
Fed would've been in danger.

532
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,530
But I'm certain

533
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,300
Fed's an immortal among men

534
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,870
and would be safe.

535
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,420
But the most important thing is,

536
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,630
I'm incompetent.

537
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,960
Here is

538
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,510
the old Lu Lingfeng:

539
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,150
petty

540
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,340
and holding grudges.

541
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,640
The morning sun of Yunding

542
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,570
has risen again.

543
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,830
They're out.

544
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,590
It's those two.

545
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,870
Kill him!

546
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,880
Give me a sip of wine.

547
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,670
It's the Eternal Drunkenness I brewed.

548
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,780
It's the Eternal Drunkenness I brewed.

550
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,830

Yunding Immortal Steps has been completely sealed off.

556
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,000
I've finished drafting

557
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,530
the notice of the reinstatement

558
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,660
of the night curfew.

559
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,280
Please take a look, Mr. Lu.

560
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,310
Why reinstate the night curfew?

561
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,830
Mr. Lu.

562
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,470
When you first arrived in Yunding,

563
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,930
didn't you also oppose it?

564
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,000
Yunding Immortal Steps

565
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,600
isn't an ordinary night market.

566
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,350
Not having a night curfew

567
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,530
has long been a tradition in Yunding,

568
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,650
and it's also welcomed by the people.

569
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,270
I think...

570
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,520
we shouldn't change it.

571
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,800
Then... Mr. Su, what do you think?

572
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,930
I'll go with Sheriff Lu's opinion.

573
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,490
I already know

575

and Sheriff Lu's senior.

576
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,920
Previously, I was blind

577
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
and offended you.

579

your opinion.

580
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,410
I believe that

581
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,230
the night curfew is just a means.

582
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,910
The purpose is for peace and order.

583
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,390
If the officials can all govern for the people

584
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,880
and work wholeheartedly for the common folk,

585
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,700
then even without the night curfew,

586
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,370
our Great Tang can still be peaceful.

587
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,440
You're wise, Mr. Su.

588
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,000

589
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,810
Sheriff Lu,

590

and Mr. Su.

591
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,030
As of today,

592
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,630
we've rescued 174 mute slaves

593
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,820
within Yunding.

594
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,540
They are temporarily settled at

595
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,060
the original site of the Yunding Immortal Steps, awaiting treatment.

596
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,090

598
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,640

599

Mute slaves can be cured?

600

Let's go take a look.

601
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,630

Here, the medicine.

605

Come, let me help you.

606

Alright, don't worry.

607
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,550
Okay.

608
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,820

609
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,750
Thank you.

610
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,340
You need to follow the doctor's instructions.

611
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,480
Take the medicine on time every day.

612
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,510
You will get better.

613
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,070
Come on, hurry up.

614
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,000
Open your mouth.

615
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,850
Be careful.

616
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,650
Send it over to him.

617

619
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,770
Magistrate Huangfu is here.

620
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,940
Let him wait.

621
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,310
This is how Physician Fed is like

622
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,120
when treating patients.

623
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,990
Magistrate, please be...

624
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,720
I understand.

625
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,520
I understand.

626
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,620
Take him to take the medicine.

627
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,880
Magistrate.

628
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,280
Miracle doctor.

629
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,950
I heard you've already cured three people.

630
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,090
After preliminary diagnoses and tabulations,

631
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,550
there are a total

632
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,790
of 174 mute slaves.

633
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,390
One-third of them are critically ill

634
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,710
who need three months of treatment

635
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,710
to fully recover.

636
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,990
What about the mild cases?

637
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,750
They'd be fine

638
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,449
after a month's treatment.

639
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,710
What about their appearances?

640
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,190
It lies in the bones.

641
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,690
A person's appearance

642
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,270
is closely related to the shape and features

643
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
of his skull.

644
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,659
That Lyu Xianke

645
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,949
and his so-called bone-kneading techniques

646
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,880
are no match for me, Physician Fed.

647
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,989
Given enough time,

648
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,190
the appearances of these mute slaves

649
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,520
will be restored to their original state.

650
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,560
You are the magistrate?

651
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,070
Yes.

Please have a seat.

657
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,730

658
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,000
just drinking.

Alright.

664
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,590
I still need to treat patients and save lives.

665
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,190

He came specifically to see you.

How can you...

670
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,750
Go, go.

671

Magistrate, why don't we...

672
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,070
You scolded him pretty harshly just now.

673
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,510
Did Su Wuming teach you that?

674
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,170
Do I need to be taught for that?

675
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,980
I just took this opportunity

676
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,090
to teach Huangfu Tan a lesson.

677
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,050

I bought the best wine in Yunding.

686

That Eternal Drunkenness?

687
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,390

689
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,550
I can't drink that.

What I bought is not Eternal Drunkenness

00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,790
but Yunding Red.

692
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,920

701

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,990
I even felt like dying.

765
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,990
I'm just afraid that in the underworld,

766
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,020
I won't be able to face my ancestors.

767
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,790
I, Huangfu Tan, swear,

768
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,050
from this day forward,

769
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,750
I'll be an upright official

770
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,030
who never neglects my duties due to drinking,

771
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,270
never listens to the slander of petty men,

772
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,060
and never...

773
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,110
From this day forward,

774
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,940
I want to rename Yunding Immortal Steps

775
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,140
into Yunding Clinic.

776
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,520
The government will provide funding

777
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,920
to let Physician Fed treat patients there.

778
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,910
In addition to treating the mute slaves,

779
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,110
it'll also benefit the Yunding people.

780
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,060
What do you two

781
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,280
think about this?

782
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,680
You're correcting your mistakes right after realizing them.

783
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,960
I admire you greatly.

784
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,030
Changing the hunting ground into a clinic

785
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,160
is truly brilliant.

786
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,800
Let's go with your plan.

787
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,410
Xijun, are you done?

788
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,350
My arms are getting sore.

789
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,820
Just hold on a little longer.

790
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,750
I'm almost done.

791
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,510
Qing Xi?

792
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,270
You...

793
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,210
You are...

794
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,130
I heard that...

795
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,790
I thought you...

796
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,570
Bao Kang in Yunding Prison

797
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,400
has already signed the divorce papers

798
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,600
and stamped his seal.

799
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,090
From now on, I can come to dance every day

800
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,950
without having to serve any man.

801
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,610
I don't even need to leave early.

802
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,610
I wonder if you're

803
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,270
still willing to hire me.

804
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,640
Oh, Qing Xi.

805
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,320
What are you talking about?

806
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,630
Without you recently,

807
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,630
the inn's business has been so poor.

808
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,910
Also, the new sheriff Lu Lingfeng

809
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,710
took down Yunding Immortal Steps.

810
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,710
There is no more evil in this county.

811
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,750
He also supports lifting the night curfew.

812
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,370
Now, Yunding's night market

813
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,190
is becoming more and more prosperous.

814
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,770
We also sell wine there.

815
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,750
Are you willing to dance there?

816
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,360
Yes.
