I've been waiting for you.

How did you know I would come?

The capital is in chaos now.

20

You're worried that I might die.

21
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,900
Of course you would come to protect me.

22
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,550
We agreed to live in seclusion,

23
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,710
but you forgot immediately.

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,370
I think you're obsessed with being an official.

in this world,

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,480
there are no gods or ghosts,

Right?

80
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,720
Exactly.

81
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,910
I heard there were a lot of people in the Ghost Market that day.

82
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,670
Mara wielded his sword, and his beast raised its hooves.

83
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,150
Those people were chopped and trampled.

84
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,260
Many people died.

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,190
Mara is afraid of pepper.

86
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,080
Take more.

87
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,790
High-quality pepper.

88
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,190
The price is reasonable.

89
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,750
Mara is afraid of pepper.

90
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,550
Prepare more.

91
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,740
Be careful with your liver. Pepper can save your life.

92
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,630
How much is your pepper?

93
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,280
It depends on how much you want.

94
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,830
How much do you have?

95
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,280
If you want all of it,

96
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,200
you can have it if you give me

97
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,030
three silver ingots of 50 taels.

98
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,680
How much?

99
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,970
That's too expensive.

100
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,830
I've never heard that pepper could sell for such a high price.

101
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,500
Forget it.

102
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,570
In my opinion,

103
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,710
you know nothing.

104
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,870
I don't want to sell it to you.

105
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,909

I'm a regular here.

107
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,270
But I'm curious about the reason

108
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,150
why Mara is afraid of pepper.

109
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,620

112
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,060
This name sounds familiar.

113
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,450
What's wrong with him?

114
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,070
If it weren't for pepper,

115
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,910
he wouldn't have kept his body intact.

116
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,780
He's dead?

117
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,230
Don't ask around.

118
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,760
It's none of your business.

119
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,160
We just want to buy pepper

120
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,960
to protect ourselves from Mara.

121
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,990
That's right.

122
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,310
Give me the money.

123
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,750
I need to take a look at the pepper.

124
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,210
Well...

125
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:27,990
Look.

126
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,570
How much dirt did you mix into the pepper?

127
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,150
What nonsense are you talking about?

128
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,750
I don't want to sell it to you.

129
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,630
Stop!

130
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,830
-Stop!
-Stop!

131
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,510
Sir, please take a look.

132
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,870
-Have you seen this man?
-Stop!

133
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,270
No.

134
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,230
You didn't mix dirt into pepper.

135
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,300
You mixed pepper into dirt.

136
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,320
This is the Ghost Market,

137
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,590
but you're not allowed to deceive others

138
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,060
by substituting inferior goods for quality ones.

139
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,470
Are you officials?

140
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,030
Yes.

141

Our duty is to catch thieves like you.

142
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,710
Why am I so unlucky?

143
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,850
When Mara came yesterday,

144
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,300
everyone was scared off.

145
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,150
I saw pepper all over the place.

146
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,150
I thought I'd become rich this time.

147
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,280
You said there was a dead person on the ground.

148
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,080
Do you remember his appearance?

149
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,030
I was almost scared to death.

150
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,600
How could I forget?

151
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,490
Take a close look.

152
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,350
Was it this person?

153
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,350
No.

154
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,110
He had bigger eyes,

155
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,310
but he was not as handsome or strong as this guy.

156
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,510
There was another body on the ground?

157
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,150
No.

158
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,360
Just one.

159
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,910
Help!

160
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,790
Help!

161
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,140
Help!

162
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,470
Scream.

163
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,300
This is the Ghost Market.

164

There are no Imperial Guards.

165
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,750
Try your best to scream.

166
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,910
It would be better

167
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,710
if more men come.

168
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,270
You came here for a man, right?

169
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,610
I'm more handsome than the guy in this painting.

170
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,669
Stop!

171
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,750

172
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,120
Xijun, don't be afraid.

173
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,570
The Ghost Market is not a lawless place.

174
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,820
The three constables of Chang'an County

175
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,150
are here.

176
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,390
Surrender now!

177
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,860
Constables?

178
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,230
You catch chickens or dogs?

179
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,860
Show me what you're capable of.

180
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,990
Bastard!

181
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,370
Don't let them escape!

183

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,950
to help you find Lu Lingfeng.

192
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,300
It's not proper to talk here.

193
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,700
We should leave here now.

194
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,310
Yes, there.

195
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,320
The beast that Mara rode

196
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,550
is taller.

197
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,110
Xijun,

198
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,150
the painting.

199
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,110
Sir.

200
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,550
Please take a closer look.

201
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,870
Does this look like it?

202
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,820
Yes.

203
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,030
I told you

204
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,710
this girl is impressive.

205
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,350
They look so alike.

206
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,120
Something's not right.

207
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,230
Why do I think

208
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540
his eyebrows are not this long

209
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,190
and his beard should be curly?

210
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,030
And his eyes

211
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,910
should be bigger, right?

212
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,520
You saw Mara too?

213
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,750
I saw him a few times.

214
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,710
I think you're right.

215
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,190
His eyebrows should be shorter.

216
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,590
His beard is curly.

217
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,310
His eyes are bigger.

218
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,710
Sir, you...

219
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,430
Sir.

220
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,000
Go back and rest.

221
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,750
Be careful.

222
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,110
Xijun, look.

223
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,510
The distance from here

224
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,090
to there is over 18 meters.

225
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,000
Also, it was in the middle of the night.

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,730
Although there was lightning,

227
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,590
considering his age,

228
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,430
how could he see

229
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,600
his eyebrows and eyes clearly?

230
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,300
You drew his eyebrows and eyes

231
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,310
so clearly

232
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,620
because the mural in Chengfo Temple

233
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,430
has been engraved on your mind.

234
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,950
I was wrong.

235
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,070
I misled Lu Lingfeng.

236
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,320
They said Mara

237
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,580
showed up with a beast.

238
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,230
This should be it.

239
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,630
This beast is called Qiongqi.

240
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,240
Qiongqi, Hundun, Taowu, and Taotie

241
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,130
are known as the four evil beasts.

242
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,030
I'd rather believe

243
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,510
it only lives in legends.

244
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,590
There are some elements

245
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,390
from the central region in the mural.

246
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,200
They're perfectly integrated.

247
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,350
It's really stunning.

248
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,550
No wonder Qin Xiaobai

249
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,310
is world-famous.

250
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,830
Get out.

251
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,830
Leave.

252
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,590
Get out!

253
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,910
You too. Get out.

254
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,360
Hurry!

255
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,760
You monk,

256
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,850
why are you so rude?

257
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,250
Who are you to kick us out?

258
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,430
Qin Xiaobai already entered the temple.

259
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,800
He can't be distracted when he does the finishing touch.

260
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,190
No one is allowed

261
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,510
to disturb him in the hall.

262
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,590
Master Qin is here.

263
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,350
Master Qin.

264
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,170
Master Qin is here.

265
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,430
Qin, you're here.

266
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,720
You must do the finishing touch today.

267
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,910
I've been waiting for this day.

268
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,710
Yes.

269
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,470
It's possible today.

270
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,020
Zu.

271
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,260
Tell me.

272
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,320
How can I show

273
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,560
Mara's horrible look

274
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,470
and Buddha's calmness through the finishing touch?

275
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,150
Senior,

276
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,040
I don't know either.

277
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,630
You've been with me painting murals for more than ten years.

278
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,190
Haven't you learned it yet?

279
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,230
I...

280
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,580
Tell me!

281
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,790
How should I

282
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,120
do the finishing touch for Mara's Defeat?

283
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,350
S-Senior,

284
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,630
I... I really don't know.

285
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,150
Loser!

286
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,990
Help! Senior.

287
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,390
Senior, please let me go.

288
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,630
Stop!

289
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,550
You loser!

290
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,110
You loser!

291
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,390
Please let me go.

292
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,710
I'm going to beat you to death, you loser!

293
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,630
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,830
Loser!

295
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,710
Loser!

296
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,660
You are a little loser.

297
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,150
I'm a big loser!

298
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,190
Senior,

299
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,350
if you can paint

300
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,990
a satisfying Mara's Defeat,

301
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,510
I would be willing

302
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,040
even if you beat me to death.

303
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,470
What's the use of saying this crap?

304
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,310
Senior,

305
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,550
I'm just worried

306
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,390
you'll be under stronger criticism

307
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,790
if there are more delays.

308
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,370
Haven't you heard?

309
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,720
Now a rumor in Chang'an says

310
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,480
the Mara who kills people and harvests livers

311
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,980
was painted by you.

312
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,390
So what?

313
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,790
-Move!
-Move!

314
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,150
Get out of the way!

315
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,140
Move!

316
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,630
Guys.

317
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,270
Guys.

318
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,110
Everyone,

319
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,110
this is a sacred place of Buddhism.

320
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,440
What are you going to do?

321
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,670
To remove the evil painting in your temple!

322
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,630
It's an order of the princess

323
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,400
to paint Mara's Defeat.

324
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,750
Why did you call it an evil painting?

325
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,160
You're talking nonsense.

326
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,220
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

327
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,860
My son Kong Mao, a professor in the Imperial College,

328
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,140
was killed by the Mara on the wall.

329
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,560
If I don't remove it,

330
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,240
should I just wait for him to do the finishing touch

331
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,830
and let Mara lead an army

332
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,390
to kill everyone in Chang'an?

333
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,050
Step aside!

334
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,150
Jia, Luo.

335
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,110
-Remove it!
-Remove it!

336
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,790
-Remove it!
-Hurry! Let's go!

337
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,190
-Step aside!
-Step aside!

338
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,520
-Step aside!
-Let's go!

339
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,720
Remove it.

340
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,800
Remove all of it.

341
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,380
Who are you guys?

342
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,110
How dare you!

343
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,310
What are you going to do?

344
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,230
What are we going to do?

345
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,490
We're going to remove the evil painting.

346
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,430
If anyone dares to come forward,

347
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,270
I'll put up a desperate fight with him.

348
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,840
Look.

349
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,510
He really is crazy.

350
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,990
Qin Xiaobai traveled around the world.

351
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,540
Someone cast an evil spell

352
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,990
on him somewhere.

353
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,750
So the demons painted by him

354
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,710
can break out of the walls to make trouble.

355
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,230
Nonsense!

356
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,950
I will kill anyone

357
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,230
who comes forward!

358
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,230
My son was killed by this Mara.

359
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,840
If we don't remove the demons on the wall,

360
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,180
what's the use of keeping them?

361
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,870
Do it now!

362
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,950
If anyone stops you,

363
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,950
beat him to death!

364
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,630
Remove it!

365
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,110
Remove it!

366
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,220
Stop!

367
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,870
Sir,

368
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,350
your son was killed by Mara.

369
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,790
Did you see it with your own eyes?

370
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,450
We didn't see it.

371
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,780
But Qin Xiaobai

372
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,230
said personally

373
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,589
the Mara painted by him can break out of the wall to kill people.

374
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,390
Even Deputy President Lu, who was investigating the case,

375
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,790
was eaten by Mara.

376
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,910
General Lu is highly skilled in martial arts.

377
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,390
He made many contributions.

378
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,710
I can't believe he was eaten

379
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,140
by this thing on the wall.

380
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,990
You must have seen it with your own eyes, right?

381
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,230
I... Well...

382
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
You didn't see it.

383
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,880
Then you're up to no good.

384
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,270
You're spreading a rumor to mislead everyone.

385
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,200
Now the court

386
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,680
is investigating who spread the rumor.

387
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,790
Are you the one?

388
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,870
Well...

389
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,550
Who are you?

390
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,670
Me?

391
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,230
I'm an old friend of Qin Xiaobai.

392
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,070
You're his friend, so you're helping him.

393
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,790
No.

394
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,480
I'm saving you

395
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,470
and everyone.

396
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,110
This Mara's Defeat

397
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,870
was painted under the princess's order

398
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,590
to pray for Empress Wu Zetian.

399
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,350
You want to destroy it

400
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,620
in a fit of anger.

401
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,270
Have you ever thought about the consequences?

402
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,550
Why does he

403
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,720
look familiar?

404
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,270
I think he's Su Wuming, a disciple of Detective Di.

405
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,220
Are you Su Wuming?

406
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:28,870
Yes.

407
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,150
I thought you were demoted

408
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,350
and went to Qianling.

409
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,790
If the rumor hadn't been spread

410
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,150
to make everyone panic,

411
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,190
I

412
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,320
wouldn't have been transferred back to the capital.

413
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,270
Su Wuming,

414
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,470
the court summoned you back to investigate this case?

415
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,470
Yes.

416
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,640
Sir, don't worry.

417
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,240
I will try my best to investigate the case,

418
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,360
find the murderer,

419
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,750
and reveal the truth of Professor Kong's death.

420
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,990
So,

421
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,910
you don't think

422
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,040
Mara is behind this.

423
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,150
Jia,

424
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,150
what did I say

425
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,670
about ghosts and gods?

426
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,230
In this world,

427
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,510
there are no gods or ghosts,

428
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,030
only people who play tricks.

429
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,150
Those who played tricks are the real murderers.

430
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,510
I

431
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,620
will catch them.

432
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,550
Qin Xiaobai

433
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,830
has been following us.

434
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,640
I know.

435
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,070
I helped him.

436
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,100
He should thank me.

437
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,190
Are you the person

438
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,080
who watched me painting the mural

439
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,290
with Lu Lingfeng that day?

440
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,230
Lu Lingfeng showed me a painting.

441
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,640
I guess you drew it.

442
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,820
Don't deny it.

443
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,820
You know paintings.

444
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,310
I heard

445
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,570
what you said that day.

446
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,790
I finally found you.

447
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,510
Did Lu Lingfeng tell you

448
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,470
I want to accept you as my disciple?

449
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,550
Well...

450
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,230
Master,

451
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,990
I admire you

452
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,920
very much.

453
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,190
I would be greatly honored

454
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,950
to be your disciple.

455
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
It's just that...

456
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,850
it's not the right time now.

457
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,910
Do we need to choose the right time

458
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,640
to become someone's disciple?

459
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,950
We don't know if Lu Lingfeng is still alive.

460
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,350
You must have heard of it.

461
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,200
What does this have to do

462
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,430
with me accepting her as my disciple?

463
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,020
He's the one Xijun likes.

464
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,530
She is very worried now.

465
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,500
Can't you see?

466
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,680
You have skills

467
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,030
and lots of talent.

468
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,560
You should focus

469
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,670
on painting.

470
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,240
Why do you care

471
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,510
about that man?

472
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,480
You're so weird.

473
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,750
Mr. Su helped you.

474
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,230
Instead of thanking him,

475
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,470
you want to accept Xijun as your disciple.

476
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,060
I think you have evil intentions.

477
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,190
You're up to no good.

478
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,390
Yingtao.

479
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,820
You guys leave first.

480
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,990
Shouldn't you thank me?

481
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,310
I just want to ask you something.

482
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,550
We are not old friends.

483
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,790
Is it necessary to flatter me?

484
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,640
Flatter?

485
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,110
I don't want to flatter you.

486
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,030
It's just that we don't know each other,

487
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,030
but both of us

488
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,210
are at a low ebb.

489
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,450
This makes us friends, right?

490
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,640
You don't look like someone at a low ebb.

491
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,400
I'm just pretending.

492
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,510
How do you know I'm at a low ebb?

493
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,470
You love painting.

494
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,190
You're world-famous.

495
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,590
But you failed to do the finishing touch.

496
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,450
This is the most painful thing in your heart, right?

497
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,820
What about you?

498
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,740
Why are you upset?

499
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,270
I...

500
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,790
was demoted although I made contributions. Is this a good reason?

501
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,040
It's about court affairs. You're vulgar.

502
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,900
I suddenly got promoted.

503
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,230
I'm not valued because of my talent.

504
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,540
It's like being grilled over a fire.

505
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,630
I'll be torn into pieces if I make a slight mistake.

506
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,230
Is this a good reason?

507
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,030
It's still about court affairs.

508
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,390
You really are vulgar.

509
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,990
Indeed, I'm vulgar.

510
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,390
But if I can do something

511
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,040
for the people,

512
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,070
maybe one day,

513
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,210
I can earn a place in the history books.

514
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,190
If I can't earn a place in the history books,

515
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,870
it would still be good if I can earn a place

516
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,830
in the books about ghost stories.

517
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,090
I'm content with that.

518
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,390
You are a disciple of Detective Di.

519
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,790
You've earned some fame.

520
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,950
Maybe you can earn a place in the history books.

521
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,790
But I'm better than you

522
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,990
because I'll be remembered because of my works.

523
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,760
Being remembered and imagined by later generations

524
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,710
through poems, paintings, and calligraphy works

525
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,310
is indeed impressive.

526
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,070
But...

527
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,440
I have

528
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,670
limited talent.

529
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,390
I'm afraid I won't

530
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,190
have a chance in this life.

531
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,110
But to earn a place in the history books,

532
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,430
I, a vulgar man,

533
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,560
have been working hard secretly.

534
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,430
To me,

535
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,020
solving more mysterious cases

536
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,270
and doing more things for the people

537
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,030
are very good deeds.

538
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,790
You have a silver tongue,

539
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,280
but you're also sincere.

540
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,170
Thank you

541
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,410
for what you did today.

542
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,070
-This guy...
-This guy...

543
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,070
Keep an eye on him.

544
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,430
But be careful.

545
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,690
He is aloof and proud.

546
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,820
Once he knows someone is watching him,

547
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,770
he will do something unexpected.

548
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,910
It will mislead us.

549
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,470
Luo.

550
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,190
You're meticulous.

551
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,590
I'm giving you this task.

552
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,080
I won't let you down.

553
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,120
Send more troops.

554
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,110
If anyone makes trouble in Chengfo Temple

555
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,590
and talks about removing the painting again,

556
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,510
kill him!

557
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,920
Yes.

558
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,510
How dare they!

559
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,550
Don't they know

560
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,550
I asked him to paint Mara's Defeat?

561
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,190
Everyone knows that.

562
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,190
They were instigated.

563
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,150
You mean the Eastern Palace?

564
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,430
You asked him to paint Mara's Defeat

565
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,590
in the name of praying for Empress Wu Zetian.

566
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,670
In fact, you want to frighten the Eastern Palace.

567
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,000
If they are frightened,

568
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,350
of course they'll play tricks secretly.

569
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,190
I heard

570
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,030
the Eastern Palace is very dissatisfied

571
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,760
with Su Wuming's appointment.

572
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,290
They are making things difficult for the Secretariat.

573
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,150
Since the crown prince

574
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,350
has the patience to deal with me,

575
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,270
let him bring it on.

576
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,570
There is still no news about Lu Lingfeng?

577
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,460
No.

578
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,610
Apart from stopping those people

579
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,010
from removing the mural,

580
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,030
Su Wuming didn't do anything else.

581
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,560
Maybe he doesn't

582
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,920
deserve his reputation

583
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,470
and doesn't know how to investigate cases at all.

584
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,520
Now you even

585
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,390
look down on Su Wuming.

586
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,300
Su Wuming saved my life many times.

587
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,630
He's the person I trust the most.

588
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,200
You've only been in the capital for a few days.

589
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,730
Don't learn to stir things up.

590
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,230
Otherwise, you'll end up dead.

591
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,110
Your Highness, I was wrong.

592
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,040
Haven't you made enough mistakes?

593
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,750
If anything happens

594
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,750
to Lu Lingfeng,

595
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,590
I'll tear you into pieces!

596
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,750
Yes.

597
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,980
Don't move!

598
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,550
Don't move.

599
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,430
Lie down.

600
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,110
It took me great effort

601
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,430
to save you.

602
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,910
Fed.

603
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,870
Is... Is that you?

604
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,150
Lu Lingfeng,

605
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,750
[Chicken Fed]

606
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,710
you don't know me?

607
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,990
Am I in the mortal world

608
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,430
or in hell?

609
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,310
Hell?

610
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,350
I won't go even if you want to.

611
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,310
I want to live longer.

612
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,630
I'm still alive?

613
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,040
If I didn't save you,

614
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,760
you wouldn't be lying here.

615
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,710
Stop talking.

616
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,430
Lie down. Don't move.

617
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,240
Let me tell you everything.

618
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,610
Here, have some water.

619
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,550
After I helped Assistant Minister Pei

620
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,680
settle down in Nanzhou,

621
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,000
I came back.

622
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,550
I ran into a pepper seller.

623
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,240
The price was reasonable.

624
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,570
So I used all of the money

625
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,670
given by the disciples in Nanzhou

626
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,990
to buy pepper.

627
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,190
I thought

628
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,000
after I return to Chang'an,

629
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,860
I could sell it in the Ghost Market

630
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,630
to make some money.

631
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,720
Who would have thought...

632
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,360
Mara broke out of the wall and killed someone!

633
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,870
Run!

634
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,110
Thanks to the blower device and the big wooden fan,

635
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I made the best

636
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,870
of my pepper.

637
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,760
But Lu Lingfeng,

638
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,150
if I couldn't save you this time,

639
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,910
I would suffer great losses.

640
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,810
Those were high-quality pepper.

641
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,180
Go ask them

642
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,340
how many chickens one jin of pepper can be traded for.

643
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,980
In the future,

644
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,280
I want one... two chickens a day.

645
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,910
You have to promise me that.

646
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,870
Guo... Guo Zhuang...

647
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,390
Guo Zhuang...

648
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:08,710
He...

649
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,500
went back to the Imperial Guards to investigate the case for you.

650
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,030
Really?

651
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,270
I saw with my own eyes...

652
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,790
Indeed, he was badly injured.

653
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,830
But I'm a highly skilled doctor.

654
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,340
Your injuries are more serious than his.

655
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,670
You need to recuperate.

656
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,510
You can't go anywhere now.

657
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,790
B-But...

658
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,470
Stop talking.

659
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,410
Get some sleep now.

660
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,350
Store up your energy

661
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,590
so that you can recover.

662
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,820
[Cloud Tower]

663
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,870
Sun Wang spoke rudely because of jealousy.

664
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,950
Qin Xiaobai was also furious?

665
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,680
Yes. This is what happened.

666
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,350
Sun Wang left in anger.

667
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,590
You didn't walk him out?

668
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,790
I did.

669
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,230
Wait, Chief Musician.

670
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,310
Wait, Chief Musician.

671
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,240
Chief Musician.

672
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,610
The new top courtesan is upstairs.

673
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,870
I'll ask her

674
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,730
to accompany you tonight.

675
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,080
No matter how impressive she is,

676
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,670
she's just a song and dance performer

677
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,390
who can be had with money.

678
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,190
Do you think I like this kind of woman?

679
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,090
Would Sun Wang ask for

680
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,160
a song performer

681
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,570
when he came to Cloud Tower in the past?

682
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,820
He would.

683
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,590
But I don't think he asked for one

684
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,040
in the past year.

685
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,830
He didn't ask for one...

686
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,840
in the past year?

687
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,960
[Ma's Mansion]

688
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,110
According to Lu Lingfeng's case investigation journal,

689
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,770
there is something suspicious in Ma's Mansion.

690
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,560
Yingtao.

691
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,550
Got it.

692
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,950
Hello, sir.

693
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,030
I want to sell a few servants

694
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,160
to a rich family.

695
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,590
I heard that Ma's Mansion on this street

696
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,510
is very rich.

697
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,230
I wonder if it's true.

698
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,470
Go somewhere else.

699
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,400
Mrs. Ma is very strong.

700
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,260
She does everything herself.

701
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,390
One year ago,

702
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,190
she dismissed all the maids and servants

703
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,270
in the mansion.

704
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,870
Why would she buy your servants?

705
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,190
One year ago?

706
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,450
Sun Wang went to

707
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,550
Ma's Mansion frequently

708
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,670
to cure the horses one year ago, right?

709
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,870
They have an affair.

710
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,250
We can't jump to conclusions.

00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,970
[Ma's Mansion]

712
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,150
I'm Su Wuming from the Supreme Court.

Greetings, Mrs. Ma.

714
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,140
You're from the Supreme Court?

715
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,600
I'm here to visit you.

716
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,920
I'm not wearing my official uniform.

717
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,340
Then... why didn't Deputy President Lu come?

718
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,950
He's busy,

719
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,350
so he sent me here.

720
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,830
Come in.

721
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,910
Your questions are the same.

722
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,640
I already

723
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,110
told Lu Lingfeng this.

724
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,590
Go ask him.

725
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,710
This is just a routine inquiry.

726
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,860
I apologize

727
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,010
for bothering you.

728
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,750
Well...

729
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,050
I heard from Deputy President Lu that

730
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,710
you have good horses.

731
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,160
What a coincidence.

732
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,360
I love horses too. Can I...

733
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,120
You both claim you love horses.

734
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,070
You just suspect

735
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,870
Sun Wang's death

736
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,200
has something to do with me, right?

737
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,710
If you want to see the horses,

738
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,710
go ahead.

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,340
you are still the Deputy President.

759
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,540
In the Supreme Court,

760
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,469
as long as you give an order,

761
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,800
everyone has to obey it.

762
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,250
But you asked who is free.

763
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,770
[Chang Fang, Director of the Supreme Court]

764
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,130
This has put us in an awkward situation.

765
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,280
That's right.

766
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,909
Since Deputy President Lu took office in the Supreme Court,

767
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:43,870
he has reinvestigated the old cases

768
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,350
in the past two years one by one.

769
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,310
[Chen Shi, Director of the Supreme Court]

770
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,870
Half of the cases have been solved,

771
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,520
but there are too many difficult cases.

772
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,570
Everyone is busy.

773
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,110
Yes.

774
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,870
We should go with you even if it's a place

775
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,230
full of immense dangers and difficulties,

776
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,490
[Zhang Qian, Director of the Supreme Court]

777
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,760
let alone the Ghost Market.

778
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,360
We will never make an excuse.

779
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,550
Because we are officials.

780
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,990
It's just that we're too busy.

781
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,800
I hope you can understand.

782
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,840
But you can dispatch the soldiers

783
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,230
and detectives as you like.

784
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,110
They are regulars in the Ghost Market.

785
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,110
The information could be leaked easily.

786
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,190
Forget it.

787
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,550
Since everyone is busy,

788
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,110
well...

789
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,950
go back to your work.

790
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,250
[Acting Deputy President]

791
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,630
Acting.

792
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,310
Fine.

793
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,430
Here.

794
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,630
The person in this painting

795
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,950
owes me a lot of money.

796
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,990
If any of you can find him

797
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,610
and get the money back for me,

798
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,310
I'll give him 20%.

799
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,580
20%?

800
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,040
Whoever finds this person first

801
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,030
can have this golden cake.

802
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,230
Will you really give us money?

803
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,710
Are you lying to us?

804
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,390
Ten coins per person.

805
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,720
Split them yourselves.

806
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,150
Don't snatch them.

807
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,940
-It's for me.
-I have a share.

808
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,060
Give me a share.

809
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,850
Don't snatch them.

810
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,110
It's mine.

811
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,470
This is mine.

812
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,710
Why did you hit me so hard?

813
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,170
Who asked you to follow me?

814
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,070
Why did you attack me?

815
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,110
You want to take my money?

816
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,790
We don't.

817
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,430
I hit you because I was worried you would hurt my brother.

818
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,560
Why would I hurt him?

819
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,800
Kill him and trade his liver for money.

820
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,750
Did something like this

821
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,070
really happen in the Ghost Market?

822
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,910
Of course.

823
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,480
You two helped

824
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,470
that old beggar save this man?

825
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,590
Yes.

826
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,950
We used that thing

827
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,990
to scatter two large bags of pepper

828
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,280
to make Mara retreat.

829
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,130
How old is this beggar?

830
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,690
He's quite old.

831
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,560
I can't tell his age.

832
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,930
Does he have acne rosacea?

833
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,630
Yes.

834
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,090
His nose is red.

835
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,630
He's so ugly.

836
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,590
With Fed,

837
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,630
Lu Lingfeng should be fine.

838
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:03,470
Mara is here to kill people and harvest livers!

839
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,010
-Don't move.
-Don't move.

840
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,510
Fed.

841
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,470
It really is you.

842
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,870
Su Wuming?

843
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,160
Something is not right.

844
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,040
I heard

845
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,760
you went to guard the mausoleum.

846
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,430
Why did you come to the Ghost Market to set a trap for me?

847
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,550
How else can I find you?

848
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,710
Go away.

849
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,670
You brats,

850
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,430
you betrayed me.

851
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,110
Take them.

852
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,270
Well, my... my chickens.

853
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,670
-Alright.
-I finally...

854
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,070
Fed.

855
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,390
where is Lu Lingfeng?

856
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:03,990
How is he?

857
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,030
Take me to him now.

858
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,750
Mr. Lu, step aside!

859
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,680
Are you willing to go

860
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,210
to the Supreme Court with me?

861
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:24,810
Yes.

862
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,230
If you stay in the Imperial Guards,

863
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,150
with your seniority,

864
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,190
you'll get promoted at the end of the year at the latest.

865
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,660
But if you go to the Supreme Court...

866
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,340
It's okay.

867
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,550
Even if I'll be a nobody for the rest of my life,

868
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,810
I'm willing as long as I

869
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,390
can stay by your side.

870
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,790
You shouldn't come to the Supreme Court to work for me,

871
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,730
but for the court

872
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,590
and the people.

873
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,090
I'll keep this in mind.

874
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,870
My good bro.

875
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:55,710
Look.

876
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,860
He's lying...

877
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,360
Where is he?

878
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:01,480
I...

879
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,910
Well...

880
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,230
Oh no.

881
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,320
I forgot to add incense when I left.

882
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,110
Stop!

883
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,350
Those who break the curfew shall stop.

884
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,410
Or we'll shoot you.

885
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,080
Pull the bowstring to warn him.

886
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,310
Prepare the arrow.

887
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,310
Aim it at his feet.

888
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,430
Yes.

889
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,360
Shoot him directly.

890
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,260
I think it's Mr. Lu.

891
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,510
Mr. Lu?

892
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,950
Lu Lingfeng.

893
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,840
You're still alive.

894
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,430
Guo Zhuang...

895
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,510
Mr. Lu,

896
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,900
I feel guilty...

897
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,580
towards the brothers...

898
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,660
of the Imperial Guards.
