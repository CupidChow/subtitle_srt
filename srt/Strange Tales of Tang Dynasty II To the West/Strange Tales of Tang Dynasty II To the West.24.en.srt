[Episode 24]

4
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,630
People of Hanzhou City, listen up!

5
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,390
I am a descendant of Duan Gui,

6
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,630
the leader of the Taiyin Sect.

7
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,250
Open the city gates at once.

8
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,950
Those who welcome me into the city

9
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,110
shall be spared.

10
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,470
Those who help me capture

11
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,370
officials of all ranks in Hanzhou

12
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,850
will be rewarded with silver.

13
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,550
The one who kills Lu Si'an

14
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,430
will be rewarded with gold.

15
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,160
How dare you!

16
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,560
Linghu, you petty thief,

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,590
how dare you impersonate a descendant of Duan Gui and plot a rebellion!

18
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,650
My surname is Duan.

19
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,790
Who is the one talking nonsense on the city wall?

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,930
[Hanzhou]

21
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,670
It is the one who traveled with you to Mount Taiyin,

22
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,630
Lu Lingfeng!

23
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,960
Linghu Shuo,

24
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,430
if you have the guts, take off your mask.

25
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,990
You're the spoiled young heir of Jiufang Pavilion.

26
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,190
Who doesn't know you?

27
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,650
This...

28
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,020
What is going on here?

29
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,110
This...

30
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,030
Yeah.

31
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,770
What's happening?

32
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:37,960
Don't listen to him!

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,300
Those disloyal to the sect leader

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,470
shall die!

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,030
Can't you tell?

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,680
This Linghu Shuo

37
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,660
just wants to use your identity

38
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,310
to seize control of Hanzhou.

39
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,470
If he succeeds tonight,

40
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,520
the first thing he'll do

41
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,150
is kill you to silence you.

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,420
Listen, people outside the city.

43
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,430
I know you are all

44
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,470
local civilians.

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,640
Life is hard

46
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,430
and you were instigated by evil people.

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,390
That's why you went to Mount Taiyin.

48
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,190
The Grand Commander Lu Si'an promises

49
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,740
that as long as you lay down your weapons,

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,470
you can all return home to farm.

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,590
The state government

52
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,250
will not pursue your actions.

53
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,530
No one is allowed to leave.

54
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,910
Betraying the sect leader means death without mercy.

55
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,120
Look!

56
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,090
The Mountain God is angry.

57
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,110
Listen up!

58
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,690
Once the Mountain God breaks through the city gate,

59
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,190
we shall work together

60
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,570
to conquer Hanzhou!

61
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,840
Chicken Fed,

62
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,270
can the medicine

63
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,660
really knock out the Tongtian rhino?

64
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,710
Well...

65
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,390
Who knows?

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,830
This is all what Su Wuming

67
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,110
told me to say.

68
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,470
Look at that commander.

69
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,870
He looks so calm,

70
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,200
but he's already mentally prepared

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,220
to be trampled into ground meat

72
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,860
by the Tongtian rhino.

73
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,230
But Lu Lingfeng is still on the city wall.

74
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,670
I—

75
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,960
Su Wuming and Yingtao are there too.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,510
So,

77
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,909
you and I cannot go.

78
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,120
In life,

79
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,030
we travel west together.

80
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,260
In death,

81
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,770
we go to the underworld together.

82
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,280
Lu Lingfeng.

83
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,410
What are you doing?

84
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,350
According to the mythical beast chart,

85
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,410
the Tongtian rhino

86
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,030
has extremely sharp eyesight,

87
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,230
loves the moonlight,

88
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,590
and after nightfall,

89
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,970
it fears when the moon is obscured by clouds.

90
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,740
Look,

91
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,920
when this cloud

92
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,050
covers the moonlight,

93
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,850
it will instantly turn blind.

94
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,840
Then I can kill it with my spear.

95
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,550
Lu Lingfeng,

96
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,790
it was originally

97
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,470
just an ordinary saw-toothed rhino.

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,550
By absorbing the essence of the sun and moon,

99
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,150
it turned into this form.

100
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,030
That is no easy feat.

101
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,190
Moreover, this rhino has human-like intelligence.

102
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,320
Eighteen years ago,

103
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,870
it once saved the life of

104
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,870
a seven-year-old girl.

105
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,400
Wouldn't killing it

106
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,820
be a pity?

107
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,900
Lu Lingfeng's martial arts are superb,

108
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,050
but it's not guaranteed that he can

109
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,590
kill the Tongtian rhino with his spear.

110
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,510
But look.

111
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,950
In an instant, all these Hanzhou soldiers

112
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,670
in the city

113
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,910
will either join forces

114
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,110
to kill the Tongtian rhino,

115
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,110
or the Tongtian rhino will slaughter the entire city.

116
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,280
It will then become

117
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,140
a truly vicious beast of this world.

118
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,230
The Taiyin Sect will also

119
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,030
be cursed by later generations.

120
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,870
This time,

121
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,000
it will be even more tragic than 18 years ago.

122
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,660
Those incited civilians

123
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,790
will all be executed for treason.

124
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,440
And all of this

125
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,510
would just be due to Linghu Shuo's

126
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,590
ridiculous ambition.

127
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,030
In my Taiyin Sect,

128
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,000
those with merit will be promoted.

129
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,270
Those who kill enemies and make achievements with me

130
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,670
will all be founding fathers of my state.

131
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,270
You will be conferred nobility and appointed as ministers.

132
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:38,390
Kill!

133
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,460
Can't you see

134
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,350
his wild ambition?

135
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,030
Copying the rhino's roar

136
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,710
can only lure the Mountain God out.

137
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,950
But in order to ride the Mountain God

138
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,280
and leave Mount Taiyin,

139
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,010
please teach me your unique skill, sect leader.

140
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,110
Ami,

141
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,070
what are you still hesitating for?

142
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,790
If we take down Hanzhou tonight,

143
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,000
you will be the founding emperor

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,260
of the State of Taiyin.

145
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,470
But I

146
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,470
am a woman.

147
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,270
Wu Zetian changed the Tang Dynasty to Zhou.

148
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,260
Why can't you be the first female emperor

149
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,310
of Hanzhou?

150
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,390
Our children will inherit the great dynasty

151
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,250
and the empire will be passed down the generations.

152
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,400
Time is running out.

153
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,370
You can't stop me.

154
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,070
I am the king of Hanzhou.

155
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,750
I will be the emperor!

156
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,630
You absolutely shouldn't have

157
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,790
taught the skill of controlling the Tongtian rhino

158
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,110
to this madman.

159
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,630
He never loved me.

160
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,510
He just wanted to use me.

161
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,450
What I said earlier still stands.

162
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,150
Those who set down their weapons

163
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,410
and return home to farm

164
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,490
will not be held accountable.

165
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,470
This...

166
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,470
Won't be held accountable?

167
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,230
Attack Hanzhou City with me!

168
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,110
Those who are disloyal to the sect leader

169
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,950
will die!

170
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,050
Go quickly.

171
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,830
Go.

172
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,270
Sheriff Lu,

173
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,490
take the sword.

174
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,840
♫The dark hair is messy, the futou is dark♫

175
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,800

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,150

Sheriff Lu,

179
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,170
you're here.

180
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,070
I came

181
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,740
to return the sword.

182
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,190
This is the sword I forged

183
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,850
that I'm most satisfied with.

184
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,430
The day I became a blacksmith,

185
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,110
I vowed

186
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,590
to forge the best

187
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,650
Heng sword in Tang.

188
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
But I suppose

189
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,960
you won't think much

190
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
of a Heng sword forged by a commoner.

191
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,160
Mu, that's nonsense.

192
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,830
This is an excellent sword.

193
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,690
In that case...

194
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,720
Apprentice,

195
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,670
bring the scabbard.

196
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,400
Yes, Master.

197
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,150
Do I have the honor

198
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,630
of gifting this to you?

199
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,490
This...

200
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,950
This isn't appropriate.

201
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,010
I forge Heng swords

202
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,490
to slay the wicked,

203
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,450
but I'm just a blacksmith.

204
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,030
I can only dream about it.

205
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,170
But now,

206
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,150
with this sword in your hands,

207
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,700
it has truly slain the wicked.

208
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,630
The people of Hanzhou are all talking about it.

209
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,140
It makes me proud too.

210
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,950
If you don't mind,

211
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,710
let it accompany you

212
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,710
as you charge into battle

213
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,560
♫Yellow sand sweep around golden armor♫

214
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,930

♫The city is aflame, the Heng sword ends the fire♫

216
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,110

♫Drunk in the sunset, my heart is full of the beautiful nation♫

220
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,510
Thank you, Sheriff Lu.

221
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,270
Many thanks to the people of Hanzhou.

222
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:29,670
♫Whom to sit with? The moon, wind, you, and I♫

223
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,950
Xijun,

224
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,070
the sword Lu Lingfeng used

225
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,090
in Nanzhou before

226
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,500
was given by you.

227
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,070
I never saw you cherish it so much.

228
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,900
This is different.

229
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,810
This sword carries

230
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,270
the affection and expectations

231
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,070
of the people of Hanzhou for him.

232
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,430
It's more worthy of cherishing than the sword I gifted.

233
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,100
Xijun,

234
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,620
you really make me feel a deep sense of respect.

235
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,150
[Hanzhou County]

236
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,720
Yingtao,

237
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,670
I haven't even said I'm leaving yet.

238
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,730
What are you doing?

239
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,690
You didn't say you were leaving,

240
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,760
but I think I

241
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:08,800
should go

242
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,280
What do you mean by this?

243
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,030
You kept holding Ami's hand

244
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,110
and wouldn't let go for even a moment,

245
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,630
and you're asking me what I mean?

246
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,890
There's no such thing.

247
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,380
You're still denying it.

248
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,140
I, Su Wuming,

249
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,870
am upright and aboveboard.

250
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,630
I never deny

251
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,510
what I've done.

252
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,840
But I really didn't hold

253
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,830
Ami's hand.

254
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,790
I was

255
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,430
gripping her wrist.

256
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,550
Plus,

257
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,570
I didn't touch her directly.

258
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,310
Gripping a suspect's wrist

259
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,990
as a constable

260
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,190
and holding a woman's hand

261
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,110
are completely different things.

262
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,640
Yingtao,

263
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,630
you're wronging me.

264
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,040
It's a huge mistake.

265
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,470
Su Wuming,

266
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,110
I...

267
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,230
Of course,

268
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,000
you also played a part

269
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,390
in eliminating the Taiyin Sect.

270
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,270
I won't hold you

271
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,590
accountable for this mistake.

272
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,990
By the way,

273
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,869
Commander Lu is hosting a banquet tonight.

274
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,109
It's both a welcome and a farewell.

275
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,490
During the banquet,

276
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,440
you should punish yourself with a few more drinks.

277
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,619
I, Su Wuming, am magnanimous

278
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,280
and will let this matter pass.

279
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,990
How...

280
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,579
How did it become my wrongdoing?

281
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,950
It is said that

282
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,520
those two giant condors

283
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,600
circled in the sky for a long time.

284
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,860
Suddenly,

285
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,270
one of them dove down

286
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,160
and hit the back window of the cell with its head.

287
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,470
The condor's body

288
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,290
was found in the cell.

289
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,470
Someone witnessed with their own eyes

290
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,200
that Song Ami

291
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,070
rode the other condor

292
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,870
and flew into the sky,

293
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,530
heading straight towards Mount Taiyin.

294
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,290
Commander,

295
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,290
I request troops

296
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,390
to enter the mountain immediately

297
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,590
and capture Song Ami.

298
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,200
Lu Lingfeng,

299
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,300
you have been to Mount Taiyin before.

300
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,430
What do you think?

301
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,870
This matter is too bizarre.

302
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,200
I haven't thought of

303
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,090
how to handle this matter.

304
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,470
Su Wuming,

305
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,210
what about you?

306
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,750
Perhaps this Tongtian rhino

307
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,860
is indeed the king of the mountains

308
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,230
and can command all beasts.

309
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,110
Wang Xizhi rode away on a crane

310
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,640
and became an immortal.

311
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,030
This Song Ami rode on a condor

312
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,290
and returned to the mountain?

313
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,830
Perhaps this woman

314
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,870
never belonged here in the first place.

315
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
That makes sense.

316
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,740
After all,

317
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,350
she is just an orphan.

318
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,870
How can Tang

319
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,390
not tolerate

320
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,470
a weak woman?

321
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,340
Mount Taiyin

322
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,080
is also part of Tang.

323
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,350
Let's hope

324
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,240
that in the deep mountains,

325
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,560
she can also live comfortably.

326
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,950
Liao Xin is dead.

327
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,950
Tian Chou is awaiting trial.

328
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,050
I have already reported this to the imperial court.

329
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,650
Soon,

330
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,350
the imperial court will send

331
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,370
a new prefectural governor and administrator.

332
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,620
What we should think about now is

333
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,950
the future of Hanzhou

334
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,790
and even the vast Hexi.

335
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,870
How can we help the people live and work in peace?

336
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,390
Only in this way

337
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,950
can rebellious organizations

338
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,550
like the Taiyin Sect

339
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,030
be unable to rise from the ashes.

340
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,580
You're wise, Commander.

341
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,950
[Hanzhou]

Thank you.

347

The one with the small mustache

348
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,140
is Detective Di's disciple.

349
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,380
He looks like a scholar,

350
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,620
but he's actually very capable.

351
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,270
Sheriff Lu is our big benefactor.

352
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,020
Indeed.

353
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,190
Take care.

354
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,350

Get out of the way.

He can't talk.

360

This is my newly bought servant.

361
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,110
He's some Yunding mute slave.

362
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,370
He's quite useful.

363
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,960
Can you understand what we're saying?

364
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,990
Is it because you became mute

365
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,250
after you got sick?

366
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,790
Enough.

367

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,740

This is White Horses by Cao Zhi.

385
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,100
My favorite two lines since childhood are:

386
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,990
The distress letter comes from the north.

how can one cherish one's life?

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,660

Cannot even care for one's parents,

392

let alone one's wife and children.

393
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,470
Since one's name is on the soldiers' list,

394
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,720
personal interests must be forgotten.

395
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,430

00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,990
many people have come from far and wide.

570
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,310
Those merchants from afar

571
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,710
aren't willing to leave.

572
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,350
Everyone has made a lot of money.

573
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,510
Isn't it all thanks to Boss Sima?

574
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,110
Didn’t you say he's the sheriff?

575
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,460
How come he's a boss now?

576
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,190
Yes.

577
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,830
Our sheriff Sima Liang

578
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,440
is also the biggest wine merchant in Yunding.

579
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,030
It's just that, for some reason,

580
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,470
the imperial court actually

581
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,790
replaced him.

582
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,670
[Yunding County Government]

583
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,950
Sheriff Sima.

584
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,090
[Yunding County Magistrate, Huangfu Tan]

585
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,710
You must not have

586
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,710
any resentment toward me.

587
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,710
How dare I?

588
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,270
[Former Yunding Sheriff, Sima Liang]

589
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,590
Since the court's newly appointed sheriff

590
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,790
will arrive soon,

591
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,430
I, who should've resigned long ago,

592
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,430
can finally go

593
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,360
and be carefree.

594
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,070
Why would I be resentful?

595
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,870
Besides,

596
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,480
there was an accident in the case file room.

597
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,190
I'm already endlessly grateful

598
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,650
that you didn't punish me.

599
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,270
I never said

600
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,740
I wouldn't punish you.

601
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,110
It's just that I won't pursue the matter

602
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,090
because of you years of hard work.

603
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,840
Thank you, Magistrate.

604
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,990
Sima,

605
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,710
what are your plans for the future?

606
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,040
What other plans can I have?

607
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,510
I only hope to sell the fine wine of Yunding

608
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,390
to Chang'an,

609
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,760
Luoyang,

610
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,650
and even throughout the entire Tang.

611
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,200
That's my only wish.

612
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,320
The road ahead is long and arduous.

613
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,240
It's difficult,

614
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,070
but once it's done,

615
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,680
Yunding will surely become renowned throughout the world.

616
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,070
I'll hold a banquet tonight

617
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,940
[Yunding Assistant of County Magistrate, Song Shang]

618
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,890
and Mr. Song will accompany me

619
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,710
to toast to your grand ambition

620
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,650
and drink to our heart's content.

621
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,010
I'm honored to oblige.

622
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,060
Ladies and gentlemen,

623
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,520
what would you like to eat?

624
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,080
One serving of each of

625
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,510
Yunding's signature dishes.

626
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,660
More importantly,

627
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,910
bring me the Yunding Red.

628
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,410
That's what I came for.

629
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,650
Sure thing.

[Dancer, Qing Xi]

631
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,590
Look at these wine vessels.

632
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,790
They are all so exquisite.

633
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,420
The wine

634
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,550
must go without saying,

635
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,120
right?

636
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,840
Come.

637
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,430
Come.

638
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,910
Let me pour the wine for you.

639
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,440

640
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,470
you are the elder.

641
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,520
It's not your responsibility.

642
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,030
Let me do it.

643
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,270
Yingtao.

644
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,850
Give it to me.

645
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,580
You do it?

646
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,420
What's the reasoning?

647
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,750
Waiter, bring the wine!

648
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,510
Coming!

649

652
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,270
along the way.

653
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,950
I, Lu Lingfeng, am not good with words,

654
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,920
but my gratitude

655
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,310
is all in my heart.

656
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,900
Let me pour the wine for you

657
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,090
to show my respect.

658
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,500
I have

659

lived for so long.

660
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,190
If I hadn't met you all,

661
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,530
I would definitely still be alone now

662
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,660
and whiling my days away in the gloomy Ghost Market

663
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,070
of Chang'an.

664

Now that you put it that way,

666
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,270
I'm also getting—

667
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,750
Enough.

668
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
Stop pretending to be sentimental.

669
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,150
Today, let us

670
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,760
drink to our heart's content.

671
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,860
Yes, yes, yes.

672
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,790
Let's drink.

673
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,720
Let's wish Lu Lingfeng

674
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,990
a smooth start in office tomorrow morning

675
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,810
and wish us all a carefree time

676

in Yunding.

677
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,320
A carefree time. Well said.

Come.

679
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,550
Cheers!

680
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,540
It is indeed good wine.

681
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,510
Still the same taste

682
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,710
So ignorant.

683
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,989
He thinks Yunding Red

684
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,670
is the limit.

685
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,190
After all, you need money

686
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,120
to drink Eternal Drunkenness.

687
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,050
Come.

688
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,630
Sirs,

689
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,889
what was the drunkenness

690
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,550
you just mentioned?

691
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,870
Eternal Drunkenness.

692
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,449
Eternal Drunkenness?

693
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,600
Is it even better than Yunding Red?

694
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,139
No matter how good Yunding Red is,

695
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,909
it's still made from grapes.

696
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,550
Eternal Drunkenness...

697
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,830
Of course, it's also

698
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,830
made from grapes.

699
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,110
It's just that

700
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,139
the brewing method is different.

701
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:50,850
Drinking it

702
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,630
can nourish one's soul and prolong life.

703
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,510
Otherwise, why would we

704
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,909
travel for so long to come here?

705
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,630
Exactly.

706
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,930
You're just bluffing, right?

707
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,380
How come

708
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,510
I've never heard of Eternal Drunkenness before?

709
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,150
You're ignorant and ill-informed.

710
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,140
It's a top-quality wine brewed

711
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,390
with ancient techniques

712
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,830
on the basis of Yunding Red.

713
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,180
Come, come.

714
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,830
Let's change to some good wine.

715
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,500
Waiter!

716
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,910
Bring a jar of Eternal Drunkenness.

717
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,550
Well,

718
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,610
we really don't have it today.

719
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,240
You'll have to wait.

720
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,500
But it's expensive.

721
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,810
Expensive?

722
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,470
How expensive can it be?

723
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,070
A jar of Eternal Drunkenness

724
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,350
costs as much as ten jars of Yunding Red.

725
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,270
Wine this expensive can't possibly taste good.

726
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:38,710
Alright,

727
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,680
you can go.

728
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,270
Don't be impatient, Fei.

729
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,710
Sooner or later, we'll drink

730
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,040
all the wine in Yunding.

731
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,340
Sheriff Lu,

732
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,580
you said earlier to drink to oour hearts' content.

733
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,670
Why don't we

734
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,000
stay here for the night?

735
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,750
Secretary Su, please

736
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,150
book the rooms for us.

737
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,270
Yes, sir.

738
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,000
Shopkeeper,

739
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,800
we need two superior rooms.

740
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,630
We happen to have two left.

741
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,630
Great.

742
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,930
They are upstairs.

743
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,970
Why did you stop dancing, Qing Xi?

744
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,470
I have to go back now.

745
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,690
I forgot about your husband.

746
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,950
So,

747
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,070
my wages for these ten days...

748
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,470
Others get paid monthly.

749
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,810
But you, Qing Xi, get paid every ten days.

750
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,310
You're lucky to have met me.

751
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,310
Shopkeeper,

752
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,950
Qing Xi is beautiful

753
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,950
and she dances well.

754
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,550
What's wrong with paying her every ten days?

755
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,510
If she could dance in my home,

756
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,400
I'd pay her daily.

757
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,910
You're right.

758
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,190
I got the good end of the bargain

759
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,890
with Qing Xi dancing at my inn.

760
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,590
Here,

761
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:06,870
Qing Xi.

762
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,830
Take this.

763
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,310
Robbery!

764
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,900
Qing Xi!

765
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,050
What happened?

766
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,130
The man in front robbed me of my money.

767
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,590
Mind your own business.

768
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,000
If you don't want to die

769
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,510
under my steel fork,

770
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,030
obediently hand over the money.

771
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,950
[Huntsman, Jin Bao]

772
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,960
[Ruffian, Huang You]

773
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:48,870
I'll pay.

774
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,050
I'll hand it over.

775
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:58,990
Jin Bao.

776
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,010
Here you go.

777
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,470
In the future, tuck your money pouch inside your clothes.

778
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,110
Thank you.

779
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,670
Don't mention it.

780
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,630
Where are you going?

781
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,250
I just got back from dancing.

782
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,470
Today is payday.

783
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,750
By the way,

784
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,840
how is Bao Kang's leg?

785
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,750
It's been over two months.

786
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,080
I was going to visit him,

787
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,390
but...

788
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,470
From now on,

789
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,250
he will probably be bedridden.

790
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,240
He really can't stand up anymore?

791
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,150
Here.

792
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,590
No need.

793
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,860
Use it make soup for Bao Kang.

794
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,450
Take it.

795
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,510
I really don't need it.

796
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,150
I know

797
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,460
Bao Kang is usually frugal.

798
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,860
He doesn't buy anything,

799
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,670
but he's injured now.

800
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,610
How can he not eat some good things?

801
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,510
Thank you, Jin Bao.

802
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,150
Huang You, get up.

803
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,210
Don't play dead with me.

804
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,230
[Qing Xi’s husband, Bao Kang]

805
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,430
Thank you.

806
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,190
I'm not afraid of suffering,

807
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,440
but you can't be so stubborn anymore.

808
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,800
How am I being stubborn?

809
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,110
Think about it yourself.

810
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,070
This chicken is so fresh.

811
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,210
It must be a mountain chicken.

812
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,750
Don't tell me you bought it.

813
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,240
Jin Bao gave it to me.

814
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,040
He told me to stew it for you.

815
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,040
He came to our house?

816
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,230
No.

817
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,490
I got robbed on the way back

818
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,910
from the inn.

819
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,190
Jin Bao happened to return from hunting.

820
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,190
He helped me get my money pouch back.

821
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,390
What a coincidence.

822
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,640
You shouldn't go dancing anymore.

823
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,390
You're disabled from the fall.

824
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,590
If I don't go out to dance,

825
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,750
we'll use up all our savings.

826
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,910
I'm disabled,

827
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,550
but I'm not useless.

828
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,150
I misspoke.

829
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,690
I'm afraid that's what you really think.

830
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,830
If you ask me, we should go see a doctor first

831
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,230
and have your legs checked.

832
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:01,750
I won't.

833
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,670
It's already like this.

834
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,070
What's the point of getting it checked?

835
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,690
It's precisely because you broke your leg before

836
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,390
and didn't get it looked at

837
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,530
that it turned out this way.

838
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,020
These legs can't recover

839
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,470
and I can't stand up anymore.

840
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,550
Even if I see a doctor, I still won't be able to stand.

841
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,880
You better be prepared.

842
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,350
Are you done reading this book?

843
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,350
I'll go return it.

844
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,830
One more night means one more day's fee.

845
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,880
Stop saying these useless things.

846
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,630
You look down on me

847
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,510
because I'm disabled.

848
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,190
Isn't that why you don't want to stay at home?

849
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,040
If you have the guts, go to Jin Bao.

850
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,970
His legs are fine

851
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,910
and he's strong.

852
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,310
Don't think I don't know.

853
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,350
You shameless woman,

854
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,590
you've been messing around with him for a long time.

855
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,550
The one you think about every day

856
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,680
is Jin Bao, isn't it?

857
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,230
You...

858
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,640
Ridiculous.

859
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,640
Who is it?

860
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,390
Qing Xi, it's me,

861
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,360
Wang Qiu from next door.

862
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,190
What are you doing,

863
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,590
sneaking into my house?

864
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,490
[Wang Qiu, neighbor of Qing Xi]

865
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,050
I...

866
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,310
I wanted to borrow your kitchen knife.

867
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,930
To slaughter a pig.

868
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,470
The one I have at home

869
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,490
is too blunt.

870
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,590
Next time, knock before entering the courtyard.

871
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,390
I did knock.

872
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,230
You didn't hear it.

873
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,120
How is Bao Kang's leg?

874
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,310
You're calling him Bao Kang now?

875
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,110
Don't you realize

876
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,470
how much younger you are than him?

877
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,430
Alright.

878
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,230
Then how is Brother-in-law Bao Kang's leg doing?

879
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,340
Don't worry too much.

880
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,360
After I slaughter the pig,

881
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,350
I'll bring over a big pig trotter for you.

882
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,830
And who said I was your sister?

883
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,760
Why are you bringing a pig trotter?

884
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,820
To help nourish Brother-in-law Bao Kang, of course.

885
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,880
As the saying goes,

886
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,550
eat what

887
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,550
you lack.

888
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,120
Well, I must thank you then.

889
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,830
Keep it to nourish yourself.

890
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,570
Return it after you're done using it.

891
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,150
Qing Xi,

892
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,880
I wasn't joking.

893
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:28,950
After butchering the pig,

894
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,790
I really will bring over a pig trotter.

895
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:31,630
Just one?

896
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,790
You want Brother-in-law Bao Kang to eat it

897
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:34,720
and then I eat it?

898
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,730
Or should I eat it

899
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,070
and then Brother-in-law Bao Kang eats it?

900
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,790
Then I'll bring two.

901
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,030
Actually,

902
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,280
I wish I could turn myself

903
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,070
into a pig trotter

904
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:45,150
for you to eat.

905
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,680
You little brat, trying to take advantage of me.

906
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,370
I'm not lending you the knife anymore.

907
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:48,970
No, no, no!

908
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,630
Look at me. I let my guard down

909
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,180
and spoke what was really on my mind.

910
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,620
You—
