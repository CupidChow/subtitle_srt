[Episode 27]

4
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,140
Let go of me!

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,390
Let go!

6
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,570
Qing Fu drew it for you?

7
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,510
Miss Peony,

8
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,230
you're so fair-skinned

9
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,150
You bastard!

10
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,210
I am a bastard.

11
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,570
I am indeed a bastard!

12
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,190
Go away!

13
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,900
Go away!

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,130
Don't bully Qing Xi,

15
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,700
or else I'll kill you!

16
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,230
Who are you?

17
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,960
It's none of your business who I am.

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,070
I'll kill you!

19
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,990
Wang Qiu,

20
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,910
you...

21
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,079
You killed someone.

22
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,070
After I killed that guy,

23
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,650
I told Qing Xi to leave first.

24
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,760
Unexpectedly,

25
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,550
she didn't go home.

26
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,350
Something must have happened to her on the way.

27
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,450
Why didn't you leave

28
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,710
together with Qing Xi?

29
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,680
At that time,

30
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,720
I hadn't recovered from the shock yet.

31
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,370
I couldn't believe I had killed someone.

32
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,100
How did you hack Wu Cai to death?

33
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,100
With a knife, of course.

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,270
How else could I do it?

35
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,200
Which part of the body did you hack?

36
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,500
I hacked him randomly

37
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,550
and finally hacked the back of his head.

38
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,550
Did you do it with the knife's blade?

39
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,140
Yes.

40
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,150
How many hacks did it take to kill him?

41
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,400
About two or three hacks.

42
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,230
He couldn't hold up

43
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,430
and died.

44
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,280
Why are you still lying?

45
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,430
I…

46
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,070
I'm not.

47
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,070
I've already admitted that I killed him.

48
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,800
How can you still say I'm lying?

49
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,270
Do you know who he is?

50
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,829
He is the best

51
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,910
forensic expert in the country.

52
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,980
Perk up your ears

53
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,490
and listen carefully.

54
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,190
On the side of the neck,

55
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,560
there are two arc-shaped marks

56
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,130
and there is bleeding.

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,110
It's clearly a bite mark

58
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,230
and the bite was very strong.

59
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,710
On the lower back of his head,

60
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,960
the scalp is split open

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
from the bottom to the top.

62
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,510
It should be an injury caused by a blunt object.

63
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,260
There are multiple knife injuries from the neck to the back.

64
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,790
As you described,

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,830
the bite marks on the neck

66
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,910
should have been left by Qing Xi when she was resisting.

67
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,200
However,

68
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,010
the mass of knife wounds

69
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,310
from the back of Wu Cai's head to his neck

70
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,200
are actually

71
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,300
divided into two parts.

72
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,950
Close to the neck,

73
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,510
there is a wound

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,270
with the flesh split open

75
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,150
from the bottom to the top.

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,450
It wasn't caused by a sharp blade.

77
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,150
You can't create such a wound

78
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,190
with a knife's blade.

79
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,950
This...

80
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,050
You are still lying.

81
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,950
It's very unwise.

82
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
This Sheriff Lu

83
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,230
is very famous.

84
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,420
Even the bandits of Chang'an and Luoyang

85
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,190
all fear him.

86
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,990
He just took office in Yunding

87
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,610
and is in the midst of establishing his authority.

88
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,870
Have you thought about the consequences

89
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,470
of angering him at this time?

90
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,950
I didn't kill the person.

91
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,430
It was Qing Xi.

92
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,230
Honey.

93
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,270
Let go of me!

94
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,040
-Let go of me!
-Don’t bully Qingxi,

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,510
or else I'll kill you!

96
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,370
Who allowed you?

97
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,680
Who allowed you?

98
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,630
I'll kill you.

99
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:57,950
You little brat.

100
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,350
You-

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,090
I'll kill you!

102
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,550
Qing Xi.

103
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,970
You killed him.

104
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,550
How many times did Qing Xi hack him?

105
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,310
I...

106
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,830
At that time,

107
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,470
I was about to pass out from the strangling.

108
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,840
I didn't see clearly.

109
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,520
It should be one slash.

110
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,670
Or maybe two.

111
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,910
It's also possible that it was three.

112
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,040
It's easy to suffocate when being strangled by the neck.

113
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,990
It's understandable that you couldn't see clearly.

114
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,600
Then let me rephrase the question.

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,730
Did Qing Xi

116
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,409
hack Wu Cai's neck

117
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,950
in a frenzy?

118
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,480
No, she didn't.

119
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,680
Are you sure?

120
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm not sure.

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,290
Qing Xi,

122
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,100
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,890
I originally

124
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,990
wanted to take the death penalty for you.

125
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,270
But I failed

126
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,110
this important matter.

127
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,430
Alright,

128
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,550
stop crying.

129
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,150
Where is the knife?

130
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,100
It just...

131
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,930
fell on the ground.

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,740
You didn't take it?

133
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,880
Sheriff Lu,

134
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,960
your cooperation with Mr. Su

135
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,290
is truly seamless.

136
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,030
I've learned a lot.

137
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,580
Stop flattering me for now.

138
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,710
Let's bring Wang Qiu with us

139
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,850
and retrace the route he took last night

140
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,110
when following Qing Xi

141
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,900
all the way to Wu Cai's house.

142
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,870
Then we'll see

143
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,820
if he was lying or not.

144
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,830
Alright.

145
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,670
You want to take Wang Qiu

146
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,090
and retrace the path from last night?

147
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,900
You guessed it.

148
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,990
The shopkeeper of the bookstore said

149
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,850
Qing Xi was in a great hurry when returning the book.

150
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,210
In the hour when Wang Qiu lost track of her,

151
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,740
what exactly was she doing?

152
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,950
It may be irrelevant to this case,

153
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,480
but I still want to find out.

154
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,710
Do you want to come along?

155
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,950
From Wang Qiu's confession,

156
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,910
it's possible that Qing Xi may flee to escape punishment,

157
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,580
so

158
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,480
I want to go and take a look at Bao Kang's home.

159
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,070
Bao Kang?

160
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,390
Is Bao Kang here?

161
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,800
Bao Kang?

162
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,900
I was calling you from downstairs.

163
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,470
Why didn't you answer?

164
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,560
What's there to answer?

165
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,430
I am working under Lu Lingfeng,

166
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,400
the new sheriff of Yunding County.

167
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,710
I'm visiting late at night

168
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,840
because I have some questions for you.

169
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,670
What's there to ask?

170
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,800
Your wife, Qing Xi,

171
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,230
has been missing for a day and a night,

172
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,630
yet you're so unconcerned.

173
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,990
It'd be better if she were dead.

174
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,510
I heard from Sheriff Lu

175
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,070
that you and Qing Xi sleep in separate beds,

176
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,990
but you don't admit to marital discord.

177
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,570
Why is that?

178
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,250
Could there be some unspeakable difficulty?

179
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,160
What's it to you?

180
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,910
You've indeed had misfortune.

181
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,950
You used to be able to go into the mountains to gather herbs,

182
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,030
but now, you're bedridden.

183
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,910
Just tell me,

184
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,560
when will you

185
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,120
help me find Qing Xi?

186
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,150
Didn't you just

187
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,350
curse her to die?

188
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,720
I was just speaking out of anger.

189
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,890
Then let me ask you.

190
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,030
Before Qing Xi went missing,

191
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,280
was there anything unusual about her?

192
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,790
No.

193
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,010
After you broke your leg, did she complain

194
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
while taking care of you?

195
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,280
Why are you asking about this?

196
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,700
There are two types of disappearances.

197
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,650
One is an involuntary disappearance.

198
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,730
The other is voluntary.

199
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,000
The case is unclear at present.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,230
We can't rule out

201
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,010
the possibility of a voluntary disappearance.

202
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,950
Are you saying

203
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,810
Qing Xi didn't want to take care of me,

204
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,470
so she ran away?

205
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,320
Based on how mean

206
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,730
you sounded just now,

207
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,600
it's a possibility.

208
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,550
Tell me,

209
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,550
how did you get injured?

210
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,990
That day, I was tired from gathering herbs.

211
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,150
I drank a gourd of wine

212
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,410
and fell asleep on the edge of a cliff.

213
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,710
Unexpectedly, a tiger came.

214
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,200
When it sniffed my face with its nose,

215
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,800
its whiskers poked into my nostrils.

216
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,710
I sneezed,

217
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,650
which startled the tiger,

218
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,050
but I was even more scared.

219
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,590
I actually forgot I was on the edge of a cliff

220
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,590
and tumbled down.

221
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,230
I see.

222
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,940
What a coincidence.

223
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,960
I have a friend named Fei Yingjun.

224
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,670
He's a disciple of the King of Medicine.

225
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,720
He's practically a miracle doctor.

226
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,030
I'll call him over tomorrow

227
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,120
to take a look at you.

228
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,450
Even if an immortal came, it'd be useless.

229
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,650
I broke my leg.

230
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,590
It can't be healed.

231
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,150
You don't want to get treated?

232
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,550
It's not that I don't want to.

233
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,030
I've been gathering herbs for so many years.

234
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,870
Don't you think I know how to treat injuries from falls?

235
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,310
It's just a pity that the injury is too severe.

236
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,430
It can't be cured.

237
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,230
Is this your cat?

238
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,840
It's quite pretty.

239
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,830
Don't scare my cat.

240
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,360
It doesn't have a guilty conscience.

241
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,780
It's not afraid of me.

242
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,050
I heard Wang Qiu was arrested.

243
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:28,990
Qing Xi

244
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,910
was killed by him, right?

245
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,070
If this kind of talk spreads,

246
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,760
the county government will punish you for it.

247
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,280
What are you talking about?

248
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,070
My lips

249
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,430
are sealed.

250
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,770
All the neighbors

251
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,140
know that.

252
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,590
Your Honor,

253
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,220
are the clues I provided

254
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,150
useful?

255
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,640
They are indeed useful.

256
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,060
Now that Wang Qiu has been arrested,

257
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,550
let someone from my side

258
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,080
take care of Bao Kang.

259
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,870
You know the county government

260
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,840
will pay for it, right?

261
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,620
I'm just trying to relieve the county government's worries.

262
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,620
Let my husband take care of Bao Kang.

263
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,220
Isn't that much better

264
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,140
than that kid?

265
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,150
Your husband?

266
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,920
I remember you said

267
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,940
you were a widow.

268
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,910
I am a widow,

269
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,770
but now I have a husband again.

270
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,150
Is this contradictory?

271
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,080
It's not,

272
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,840
but Bao Kang

273
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,720
doesn't need your husband to take care of him.

274
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,310
Stingy.

275
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,510
If I had known it would be like this,

276
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,240
I should have told the sheriff.

277
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,500
You're just a follower.

278
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,430
What you say doesn't count anyway.

279
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,350
Right here

280
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,250
is where I lost Qing Xi.

281
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,190
It's the two intersections up ahead.

282
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,390
I didn't see clearly which way she went.

283
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,560
Squat down.

284
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,710
Wang Qiu,

285
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,830
what was with you yesterday?

286
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,670
I knew that woman

287
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,780
you were following.

288
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,150
I didn't expect you

289
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,130
to have the guts to do that.

290
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:39,800
Who is it?

291
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,030
Stop right there.

292
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,640
Wang Qiu,

293
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,930
who is the one that ran away?

294
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,750
Huang You. I drank with him last night.

295
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,830
Go.

296
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,130
Your Honor,

297
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,620
I'm a good person.

298
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,430
I've never done anything bad.

299
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,090
Squat down.

300
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,620
I heard you hit jackpot recently.

301
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,220
Was it by robbery or theft?

302
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,700
No,

303
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,360
it was just some money

304
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,650
from Jin Bao.

305
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,790
Jin Bao?

306
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,610
That huntsman?

307
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,190
Yes, yes.

308
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,670
He's my neighbor.

309
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,450
Friend,

310
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,480
not bad.

311
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,020
Qing Xi,

312
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,880
what's wrong?

313
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,780
Here.

314
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,550
Jin Bao?

315
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,960
Bao Kang treated him as a friend,

316
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,110
but he used such tactics

317
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,170
on Bao Kang's wife.

318
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,100
This bastard.

319
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,190
Oh, right.

320
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,170
I remember now.

321
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,210
Yesterday,

322
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,010
I lost track of Qing Xi here.

323
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,310
She must have gone to Jin Bao's house.

324
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,510
What took you so long?

325
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,590
Qing Xi went missing?

326
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,400
She came to your house last night.

327
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,970
No, she didn't.

328
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,069
But at dusk yesterday,

329
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,069
I did see her.

330
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,829
There was a robber who tried to snatch her purse.

331
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,960
I lent a helping hand

332
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,589
and even gave her a pheasant.

333
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,030
There was a robbery?

334
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,740
Yes.

335
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,470
That robber was very arrogant

336
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,400
and even pulled out a knife.

337
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,319
Officer Suo.

338
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,630
Is this the robber?

339
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,030
This...

340
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,950
Take him away.

341
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,510
I... I did ask Huang You

342
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,040
to pretend to be the robber.

343
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,440
It's because

344
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,130
Bao Kang and I had a falling out

345
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,190
and I hadn't seen Qing Xi in a long time.

346
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,190
I had no excuse

347
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,510
and felt embarrassed to give her the pheasant directly.

348
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,550
She clearly came to your house last night.

349
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,750
Why are you hiding it?

350
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,600
She didn't come.

351
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,630
You're not telling the truth.

352
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,150
Do you want me to

353
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,550
call the second witness?

354
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,270
Jin Bao,

355
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,780
return Qing Xi to me!

356
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,910
Last night, Qing Xi left home

357
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,150
and Wang Qiu followed her all the way.

358
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,550
He personally saw Qing Xi enter your house.

359
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,060
You deliberately hid that fact.

360
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,430
Could it be that you

361
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,090
killed Qing Xi?

362
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,970
I... I didn't.

363
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:14,880
I didn't.

364
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:15,990
I...

365
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,430
I'll confess.

366
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,790
I'll confess.

367
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,530
I'll confess everything.

368
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,770
I didn't see it personally.

369
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,230
Why are you talking so much?

370
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,710
Get out.

371
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,200
Go.

372
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,710
So you…

373
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,800
You must tell the truth now.

374
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,240
I had Huang You pretend to rob her

375
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,350
and then gave her a pheasant.

376
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,790
I thought that Qing Xi was polite

377
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,960
and would return the favor,

378
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,190
so last night,

379
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,290
I kept waiting for her at home.

380
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,870
Qing Xi?

381
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,520
Come on in.

382
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,430
Come, have a seat.

383
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,310
Sit.

384
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,290
Did you stew the pheasant?

385
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,040
Was it tasty?

386
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,770
Could it be that

387
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,080
Bao Kang didn't appreciate it?

388
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,120
He hurt you again with harsh words?

389
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,260
He's in a bad mood from being bedridden

390
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,030
and vented his anger.

391
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,880
It's nothing.

392
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,370
A wife who is so understanding

393
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,270
is really rare in this world.

394
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,310
You haven't eaten yet, right?

395
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,450
I just stewed the wild game.

396
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,510
Try my cooking.

397
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,200
No need.

398
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,030
Don't stand on ceremony.

399
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,910
I often ate your cooking before.

400
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,800
Consider this a repayment.

401
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,980
How did you meet

402
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,500
Bao Kang and Qing Xi?

403
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,270
Three years ago,

404
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,760
when I was chasing a wild rabbit,

405
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,960
I accidentally slipped down

406
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,790
a hill

407
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,510
and twisted my ankle.

408
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,670
Luckily, Bao Kang was

409
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,800
collecting herbs nearby and found me.

410
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,310
He treated my injury

411
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,630
and helped me down the mountain.

412
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,690
After I recovered,

413
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,250
we often went into the mountains

414
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,130
together.

415
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,350
He would collect herbs

416
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,280
and I would hunt.

417
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,190
During that time,

418
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Bao Kang always invited me over to his house for meals.

419
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,670
Qing Xi's cooking was delicious

420
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,680
and she was very warm and friendly.

421
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,310
Jin Bao,

422
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,190
Bao Kang is always happy when you come.

423
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,850
Otherwise,

424
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,860
he just messes with those herbs all day

425
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,590
and doesn't even say a word to me.

426
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,190
Come.

427
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,910
Bao Kang is exploring the principles of medicine.

428
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,070
He's immersed

429
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,950
in his own world.

430
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,210
He will surely achieve great things in the future.

431
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,620
It's good enough to just gather herbs and sell them to the clinic.

432
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,290
What's the use of researching on his own?

433
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,150
I'm afraid that

434
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,030
he'll become even more withdrawn because of this.

435
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,550
He's not like you, Jin Bao,

436
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,100
racing through the mountains every day

437
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,310
with the sky as the limit.

438
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,710
Your personality is so open and generous too.

439
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,270
How nice.

440
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:07,950
Come,

441
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,000
let me toast you.

442
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,880
Come.

443
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,180
Come.

444
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,510
After that, Bao Kang rarely

445
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,440
invited me to his house for dinner.

446
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,530
Especially this time,

447
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,790
he broke his leg

448
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,280
and his temperament changed drastically.

449
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,190
He often speaks to Qing Xi coldly

450
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,350
and sarcastically.

451
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,710
He doesn't hit her directly,

452
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,550
but that's because

453
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,280
he's bedridden and can't do it.

454
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,620
Continue talking about what happened last night.

455
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,550
Come.

456
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,710
This is Yunding Red.

457
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,050
I usually can't bear to drink it.

458
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,510
Here.

459
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,630
I don't come to your place often.

460
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,830
Before, it was always with him too.

461
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,830
Yes.

462
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,830
Today, I'm here,

463
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,890
and you're only serving me wild game?

464
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,590
Or do you think I've never had Yunding Red before?

465
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:10,990
Well…

466
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,200
What are you doing?

467
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,310
Jin Bao,

468
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,170
I don't believe hunting is all you can do.

469
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,310
Wait.

470
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,040
Put your clothes on.

471
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,530
Bao Kang and I are close friends.

472
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,390
By doing this,

473
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,570
what kind of person do you take me for?

474
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,430
That's it.

475
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,110
I concealed it

476
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,700
because I was afraid the rumor

477
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,710
would make life difficult for Bao Kang's wife.

478
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,470
Jin Bao,

479
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,580
from what I've heard,

480
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,980
you are a true gentleman.

481
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,350
I have been righteous since I was a child

482
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,540
and have never changed.

483
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,830
Qing Xi went to your house

484
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,310
and didn't even hold a wine cup?

485
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,830
Yes.

486
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,750
According to your description,

487
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,830
it was less than 15 minutes from when she entered

488
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,230
to when you drove her out.

489
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,720
More or less.

490
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,630
Suo Long,

491
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,710
I'm handing it to you now.

492
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,770
Alright.

493
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,140
Do you know what this is?

494
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,720
It's Wolf Tendon.

495
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,310
Sheriff Lu

496
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,930
brought this from Chang'an.

497
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,390
It's specifically used for detecting lies.

498
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,430
Later, we'll roast it over a fire

499
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,850
and hold it under your nose like this.

500
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,430
If the corner of your mouth twitches,

501
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,150
it means you're lying.

502
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,250
When that happens,

503
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,510
you'll be flogged.

504
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,180
This treasure is very precious.

505
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,470
If it weren't a matter of life and death,

506
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,190
I really wouldn't let him use it.

507
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,520
After all, lighting it once

508
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,950
will use up a lot of it.

509
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,130
Sheriff Lu,

510
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,990
he twitched.

511
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,830
How dare you lie

512
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,130
in front of the newly appointed sheriff?

513
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,150
I'll flog you myself.

514
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,950
I guarantee I'll split your flesh,

515
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,060
snap your tendons, and fracture your brones.

516
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,120
You'll be unable to

517
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,270
go into the mountains

518
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,130
and hunt again.

519
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,870
Your Honor, please spare me!

520
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,270
Your Honor, please spare me!

521
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,430
I didn't kill Qing Xi.

522
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,190
I didn't kill Qing Xi.

523
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,520
Didn't kill her?

524
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,050
Then what did you do to her?

525
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,790
I…

526
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,310
I…

527
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,150
Jin Bao,

528
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,470
not only can you hunt game in the mountains,

529
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,270
but your cooking is aso amazing.

530
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,100
Well, eat more then.

531
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,550
I'm full.

532
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,670
I came today

533
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,340
because I have a favor to ask.

534
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,200
Go ahead.

535
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,870
I want to ask you to persuade him to see a doctor.

536
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,440
Maybe his legs can still be saved.

537
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,150
You also know

538
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,390
that he already

539
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,310
dislikes me.

540
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,590
If I go now…

541
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,370
I really have no other way.

542
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,950
Bao Kang has a withdrawn personality.

543
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,960
You're his only friend

544
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,600
in all of Yunding.

545
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,970
When he was first injured,

546
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,730
I invited doctors to our home,

547
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,260
but he forced them all away.

548
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,470
Now,

549
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,810
I couldn't carry him to the clinic

550
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,180
even if I tried.

551
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,560
You are his best friend.

552
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,150
We can forcefully carry him

553
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,630
to the clinic.

554
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,590
After all, this is a lifelong matter.

555
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,300
If we get to the clinic

556
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,730
and the doctor says it can't be cured,

557
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,660
then I'll accept my fate.

558
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,070
Qing Xi,

559
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,550
you came tonight

560
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,630
just to say this to me?

561
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,100
I know

562
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,320
this puts you in a difficult position.

563
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,390
If Bao Kang really can't

564
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,310
stand up anymore,

565
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,690
do you plan to take care of him for life?

566
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,300
Qing Xi,

567
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,400
Bao Kang doesn't deserve you.

568
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,670
Look at him now.

569
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,470
He stays in bed and reads every day,

570
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,510
relying on you dancing to make a living.

571
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,030
He still gives you a hard time

572
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,960
and insults you,

573
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,110
yet you let him be.

574
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,150
Look at me.

575
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,190
Isn't my life

576
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,750
better than his?

577
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,910
I'll tell you the truth.

578
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,610
Matchmakers come to my door every other day,

579
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,720
but I don't fancy other women.

580
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,330
You're the one I've been waiting for.

581
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,790
Jin Bao,

582
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,200
do you have

583
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,960
some misunderstanding about me?

584
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,220
No misunderstanding.

585
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,950
I know you like me.

586
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,870
When I went to your house for dinner before,

587
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,590
the way you looked at me

588
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,110
already told me everything, didn't it?

589
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,670
Jin Bao,

590
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,590
you're really overthinking it.

591
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,660
Qing Xi,

592
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,190
tonight,

593
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,640
let's be frank with each other.

594
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,550
What are you doing?

595
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,810
Jin Bao, are you crazy?

596
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,990
Let go!

597
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,210
Let go of me!

598
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,640
Who's there?

599
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,810
Qing Xi.

600
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,790
Qing Xi, don't go yet.

601
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,250
Qing Xi!

602
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,230
Qing Xi, don't go.

603
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,220
-Go away!
-Qing Xi!

604
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,870
Qing Xi!

605
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,830
Qing Xi.

606
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,910
Someone was spying.

607
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,510
Was it a thief?

608
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,990
I don't think he lied this time.

609
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,160
The shopkeeper of the bookstore said

610
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,070
Qing Xi smelled faintly of alcohol

611
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,550
and

612
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,670
had eaten.

613
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,650
This also matches the hour of time

614
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,050
that Wang Qiu mentioned.

615
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,900
What should we do now?

616
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,350
First, take them back to the county government office.

617
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,980
Record their confessions in the file

618
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,990
and have them sign it.

619
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,430
Yes.

620
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,750
Sheriff Lu,

621
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,910
this is really

622
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,710
a big gain.

623
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,070
Officer Suo.

624
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:12,750
Yes.

625
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,940
Please help me

626
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,550
go and bring Bao Kang

627
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,190
to the county government office.

628
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,830
Bao Kang?

629
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,960
He can't get out of bed.

630
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,630
It's okay.

631
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,470
I'll just carry him here.

632
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,750
No.

633
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,780
Have him walk by himself.

634
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,260
Also,

635
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,880
bring me The Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty Government Rumors

636
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,100
that he's reading.

637
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,790
Take a few more people with you

638
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,560
and search carefully

639
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,670
around their house.

640
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,230
Su Wuming,

641
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,150
could it be that you got an even bigger gain?

642
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,470
Hurry up.

643
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,590
Liar,

644
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,520
hurry and go.

645
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,670
Bao Kang,

646
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,630
no wonder you wouldn't get a doctor.

647
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,230
How did you know

648
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,790
my leg is fine?

649
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,500
You love your cat.

650
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,550
You feed it on time every day.

651
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,340
When I left,

652
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,030
the food was still warm.

653
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,940
Actually, I was very puzzled

654
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,950
after you told me

655
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,020
how you got injured.

656
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,430
That day, I was tired from gathering herbs.

657
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,540
I drank a gourd of wine

658
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,860
and fell asleep on the edge of a cliff.

659
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,980
Unexpectedly, a tiger came.

660
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,450
When it sniffed my face with its nose,

661
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,390
its whiskers poked into my nostrils.

662
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,910
This story

663
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,470
is recorded in The Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty Government Rumors.

664
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,190
However,

665
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,270
in the story, the one who fell off the cliff

666
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,790
was the tiger.

667
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,830
You were the one who peeped

668
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,910
outside Jin Bao's window

669
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,970
yesterday, right?

670
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,880
It was me.

671
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,550
What was your intention?

672
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,410
I pretended to be crippled

673
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,640
just to see if

674
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,790
Qing Xi and Jin Bao

675
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,620
had already hooked up.

676
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,810
Are you satisfied now?

677
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,330
What right do you have

678
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,390
to test your wife

679
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,070
in such a way?

680
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,610
Your Honor, you won't suspect me, right?

681
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,050
I didn't harm Qing Xi.

682
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,890
If you didn't harm Qing Xi,

683
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,710
then you killed Wu Cai.

684
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,350
Who is Wu Cai?

685
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,700
I don't know him.

686
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,470
Sheriff,

687
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,530
this knife was found

688
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,400
in Bao Kang's woodshed.

689
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,060
There are faint traces of blood remaining on it.

690
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,720
You're really frugal.

691
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,800
You can't even bear to throw away

692
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,920
a murder weapon.

693
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,950
He humiliated Qing Xi first.

694
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,060
It's understandable

695
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,060
that I killed him.

696
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,870
Jin Bao.

697
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,310
That little bastard Wang Qiu

698
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,730
also had his eye on Qing Xi

699
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,800
and followed her all the way. He pissed me off.

700
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,750
But he ended up losing track of Qing Xi

701
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,900
because he didn't know

702
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,430
Jin Bao's house was nearby.

703
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,190
Jin Bao,

704
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,620
do you have some misunderstanding about me?

705
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,830
No misunderstanding.

706
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,000
I know you like me.

707
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,830
When I went to your house for dinner before,

708
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,960
the way you looked at me

709
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,160
already told me everything, didn't it?

710
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,490
Jin Bao, you're really overthinking it.

711
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,310
Qing Xi,

712
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,230
tonight,

713
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,520
let's be frank with each other.

714
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,260
What are you doing?

715
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,920
Let go of me!

716
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,530
Jin Bao, are you crazy?

717
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,630
Let me go!

718
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,720
Who's there?

719
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,230
Honey,

720
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,440
you don't recognize me?

721
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,080
Didn't we meet at

722
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,910
the Flying Fairy Body Art Store?

723
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,600
What do you want?

724
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,470
Since you love reading The Immortal's Cave,

725
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,870
come to my home to read it.

726
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,390
I have even better things in my home.

727
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,410
We can

728
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,390
read it together.

729
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,210
Scoundrel!

730
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,150
How do you know that's my nickname?

731
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,870
Let go of me!

732
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,560
-Come on, honey.
-Let go of me!

733
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,310
I'm still very angry now.

734
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,690
What right does Wang Qiu have

735
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,170
to save Qing Xi?

736
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,530
It turns out both of them were useless

737
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,230
and didn't dare to kill.

738
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,989
I've said everything I have to say.

739
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,120
You constables must

740
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,590
find my wife as soon as possible.

741
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,120
If she was really murdered,

742
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,929
you must also find the murderer quickly.

743
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,190
You don't wish Qing Xi well.

744
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,639
She'll get in trouble sooner or later.

745
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,870
For example, after I pretended to be injured,

746
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,400
I told her not to go dancing,

747
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,910
but she insisted on going.

748
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,400
She twisted and turned

749
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,890
before people every day,

750
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,430
striking coquettish poses.

751
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,890
How could nothing happen?

752
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,120
And also,

753
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,010
in order to earn more money from dancing,

754
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,030
she even painted peonies

755
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,350
on her shoulder.

756
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,830
You tell me.

757
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,470
When she got her body art done,

758
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,870
wasn't she alone

759
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,040
with the body artist

760
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,020
in the room?

761
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,410
Something must have happened long ago.

762
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,270
This lowly woman!

763
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,710
Take him away.

764
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,950
Wait.

765
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,510
Whether Qing Xi was murdered or not

766
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,140
is still unknown at present,

767
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,480
but her disappearance

768
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,700
was because of you.

769
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,270
Because of me?

770
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,920
After you killed Wu Cai and returned home,

771
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,100
you didn't see Qing Xi,

772
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,640
but were there any traces

773
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,310
showing that she'd come home?

774
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,320
I can't remember.

775
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,070
You had a guilty conscience,

776
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,350
so you didn't look carefully.

777
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,510
Are you saying

778
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,370
Qing Xi arrived home before me?

779
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,890
Isn't that possible?

780
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,940
No way.

781
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,110
Although I went to Wu Cai's house after her,

782
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,820
it didn't take too much time.

783
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,280
Besides, I took a shortcut afterwards

784
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,270
and rushed home.

785
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,030
At that time, Qing Xi

786
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,860
was also in a state of panic.

787
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,750
Wouldn't she also rush back?

788
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,310
If after she went back

789
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,920
and found you were not at home,

790
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,910
she would know

791
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,110
that she had been completely deceived.

792
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,270
Wouldn't she

793
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,310
hide herself on purpose,

794
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,670
so that you can never find her again?

795
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,150
I...

796
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,310
Send him to Yunding Prison

797
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,150
to reflect on himself.

798
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,130
-Yes!
-Yes!

799
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,990
Get up.

800
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:13,830
Go.

801
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,380
I know what you're going to say.

802
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,040
I shouldn't be so impulsive

803
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,000
when interrogating suspects.

804
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,710
Actually, what I wanted to say just now was

805
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,900
that slap of yours

806
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,630
was well done.

807
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,640
I wanted to slap him too.

808
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,540
It was because of your good analysis.

809
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,350
That Qing Xi

810
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,710
probably hid herself away.

811
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:49,690
Bao Kang!

812
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,300
Bao Kang!

813
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,280
Why haven't you said a word since you came?

814
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,230
I want a

815
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,680
blooming peony.

816
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,640
The bolder, the better.

817
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,120
Where do you want it?

818
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,700
On my entire back.

819
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,620
I see that this peony

820
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,590
has finally bloomed.

821
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,950
Silly woman.

822
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,940
You were really hurt

823
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,210
by men.

824
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,910
Qing Xi has not been found yet,

825
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,550
but the murder of Wu Cai

826
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,520
has been solved.

827
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,030
This night's work was not in vain.

828
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,420
Suo Long has already taken men

829
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,510
to Anyuan Inn.

830
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,130
They've also visited the people

831
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,190
who'd interacted with Qing Xi before

832
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,250
and found nothing.

833
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,000
Do you think this woman

834
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,500
might've left Yunding

835
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,630
in a fit of anger?

836
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,030
After being completely disappointed by the one you deeply love,

837
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,260
leaving is a possibility.

838
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,510
Oh, right.

839
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,060
I read Wang Qiu's confession.

840
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,480
He said

841
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,790
he once heard Wu Cai

842
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,340
mention a name.

843
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,140
What was it again?

844
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,440
Qing Fu drew it for you?

845
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,790
Qing Fu.

846
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,550
Yes,

847
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,360
that's the name.

848
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,390
The peony on Qing Xi's shoulder

849
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,090
was about to bloom.

850
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,400
It looked so lifelike.

851
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,230
When we first arrived at Yunding

852
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,590
and saw her dance

853
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,030
at Anyuan Inn,

854
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,630
the peony left a deep impression

855
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,670
on me.

856
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,910
The Vaiśravaṇa

857
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,350
on Wu Cai's back

858
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,480
was also exquisitely painted.

859
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,530
I think they should be from

860
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,610
the same body artist.

861
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,870
Body artist?

862
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,830
I've heard of it in Chang'an.

863
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,030
They're also known as body craftsmen.

864
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,170
But I don't know if Yunding

865
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,700
has this profession or not.

866
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,990
Su Wuming,

867
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,750
you're truly a wily old fox.

868
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,230
You found new clues

869
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,070
just by reading the confession records.

870
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,930
I'll go and have someone investigate it right away.

871
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,550
How is this being a wily old fox?

872
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,710
Shouldn't it be...

873
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,030
You're back?

874
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,110
Just in time for the meal.

875
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,110
You cooked it?

876
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,810
Yingtao and I cooked it together.

877
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,440
Yingtao,

878
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,510
time to eat!

879
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,570
Smells delicious.

880
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,760
You two ladies

881
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,220
didn't come home all night.

882
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,070
How improper!

883
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,070
What would you do

884
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,310
if you encountered evildoers?

885
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,070
Xijun,

886
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,790
look.

887
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,570
He even scolded me

888
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,500
because he's worried about you.

889
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,530
Actually,

890
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,420
Yingtao and I were extra careful.

891
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,900
There won't be any danger.

892
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,180
If you ask me,

893
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,190
being able to sneak into Yunding Immortal Steps

894
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,790
is a great achievement.

895
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,160
Lu Lingfeng,

896
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,670
didn't you also find out

897
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,790
that Qing Fu's body art store

898
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,470
is in Yunding Immortal Steps?

899
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,590
They were scouting the way for you.

900
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,630
How can you scold them?
