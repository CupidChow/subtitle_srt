to stay in Chengfo Temple in Chang'an

10
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,710

He's about to draw the eyes.

It'll make my day.

16
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,070
I'm grateful to have been born in Chang'an

17

so I can witness this moment.

18
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:57,630
Yes.

19
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,350
Be quiet.

20
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,870
Why is he leaving?

21
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,310
Yeah, why is he leaving?

Why is he leaving?

24
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,550
In terms of murals,

25
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,030
the illustration of hell is hard enough.

26
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,270
The illustration of Mara's Defeat is even harder.

27
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,150
It's said Her Highness has long put it on the agenda.

28
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,050
But no one but Master Qin

29

It's such a difficult mural,

but you've nearly finished it

32

Yes.

41
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,670
I heard that you've been hesitating for three days

42

Right.

The Mo sword is usually used

120

by armies defending the borders,

121
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,010
like the Anxi Army.

122

Why did it suddenly appear in the capital?

What's that scent?

124

There was balm behind the victim's ear.

125
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,960
The scent should be from it.

I think

it's a kind of lip balm for women.

131

But I don't know lady stuff.

132

it's become popular in the capital.

142

But it was raining until this morning.

143
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,550
How could the lip balm

144
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,120
still have such a strong scent?

are common.

147
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,790
But it's indeed strange that the scent still lingered

I'll go with you, okay?

194
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,990
Very big.

195
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,110
Very high.

196
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,670
Very high?

197
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,060
Yes.

198
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,020
On the back of a monster.

199
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,310
Very scary.

200
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,400
[Cloud Tower]

201
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,410
I was put on the spot at that time.

202
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,720
Everyone knows

203
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,980
Her Highness paid a hefty sum to bring Qin Xiaobai

204
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,300
to the capital.

205
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,810
The Chief Musician

206
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,880
was also promoted by Her Highness.

207
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,470
It just

208
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,810
didn't make sense.

209
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,950
Was he a regular?

210
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,750
Yes.

211
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,470
He came almost every day.

212
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,120
The Chief Musician,

213
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,630
an eighth-ranked official,

214
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,690
came to Cloud Tower, the most expensive

215
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,150
restaurant in Chang'an, every day.

216
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,150
He was quite rich.

217
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,750
You misunderstood.

218
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,680
[Bi Chengye, the owner of Cloud Tower]

219
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,860
Every piece of music played here

220
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,380
was revised by him.

221
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,510
When he drank here,

222
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,950
I wouldn't ask him to pay.

223
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,470
When was that?

224
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,210
A little past 9 p.m.

225
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,560
Sun Wang used to be a vet.

226
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,140
Last month, by River Qu,

227
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,430
he treated Her Highness' horse

228
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,270
and played konghou

229
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,230
by chance.

230
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,750
Her Highness heard it

231
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,650
and ordered him

232
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,470
to play dozens of other instruments.

233
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,870
He was good at all of them.

234
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,550
Her Highness was pleased

235
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,930
and transferred him from the Court of the Imperial Stud

236
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,440
to the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

237
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,630
A vet

238
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,090
who was also a great musician?

239
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,140
How interesting.

240
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,690
Where are you going?

241
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,750
Since there is no clue in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices,

242
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,490
I'll go to the Court of the Imperial Stud.

243
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,230
[Loyalty and Devotion]

244
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,030
In the last year,

245
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,310
the place Sun Wang

246
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,230
went to the most often to treat horses

247
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,240
was the residence of General Ma Xiong of the Anxi Army.

248
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,080
[Ma's Mansion]

249
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,980
Sirs,

250
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,820
[Mrs. Ma]

251
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,110
what can I do for you?

252
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,650
Is it General Ma's residence?

253
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,630
We're government officials, here for a routine inquiry.

254
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,120
Dr. Sun

255
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,900
did treat my horses.

256
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,070
What's wrong?

257
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:13,910
He...

258
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,610
Nothing.

259
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,120
Just a routine inquiry.

260
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,950
Is Dr. Sun a good vet?

261
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,030
Of course.

262
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,830
He's one of the best vets

263
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,730
in the Court of the Imperial Stud.

264
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,750
I doubt that.

265
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,630
If he's really a good vet,

266
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,970
why did he come here

267
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,430
dozens of times last year?

268
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,040
My husband works in the Anxi Army.

269
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,630
Every time he came back,

270
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,490
he brought back some good horses.

271
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,100
So we keep many horses

272
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,070
in our stable.

273
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,790
My husband is a mobile corps commander,

274
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,980
a fifth-ranked official.

275
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,230
When his horses are sick,

276
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,390
ordinary vets

277
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,350
are not qualified to treat them.

278
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,430
So I had to send for Dr. Sun.

279
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,110
Dr. Sun is a great vet,

280
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,790
but some horses

281
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,660
needed to be treated several times

282
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,830
to fully recover.

283
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,190
I see.

284
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,870
I love horses too.

285
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,270
Can I see your horses?

286
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,990
Sure.

287
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,830
You keep so many horses

288
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,090
at your own residence.

289
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,550
It's enviable.

290
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,310
My husband got these horses

291
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,390
when he was away fighting in battles.

292
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,570
He's a decorated warrior.

293
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,670
That year, when he fought against Farghana,

294
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,400
he got three Akhal-Teke horses

295
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,430
and sent them all into the court.

296
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,110
Emperor Zhongzong was so happy

297
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,240
that he returned one

298
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,160
and allowed us to raise horses.

299
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,240
Look.

300
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,560
There are more and more horses now.

301
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,670
Akhal-Teke?

302
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,670
That one?

303
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,830
Can I ride it?

304
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,190
It's not saddled.

305
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,790
I'll have no regrets in life

306
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,830
if I can ride an Akhal-Teke horse.

307
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,950
That horse is aggressive.

308
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,960
Be careful.

309
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,910
Are you okay?

310
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,150
I'm fine.

311
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,080
It's indeed aggressive.

312
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,310
Can General Ma ride it?

313
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,570
It's his horse.

314
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,840
Of course he can.

315
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,790
General Ma hasn't come back recently, right?

316
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,030
Serving in the Anxi Army,

317
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,950
he can't come back whenever he wants.

318
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,850
It's been three years

319
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,650
since the last time he came back.

320
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,730
What weapons did he use

321
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,650
when fighting battles?

322
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,230
He uses the Mo sword.

323
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,830
I forgot to ask,

324
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,200
which government office are you from?

325
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,310
I'm the Deputy President of the Supreme Court,

326
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,040
Lu Lingfeng.

327
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,030
The Supreme Court?

328
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,870
Strange.

329
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,150
What brought you

330
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,630
to my residence?

331
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,150
Sun Wang

332
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,430
is dead.

333
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,320
Mrs. Ma!

334
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,270
Mrs. Ma!

335
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,690
Mrs. Ma needs rest.

336
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,040
Go in and find out

337
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,120
where the bed is.

338
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,510
Mr. Lu.

339
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,870
Did you throw out your back

340
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,250
when falling from the horse

341
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,650
or when carrying Mrs. Ma?

342
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,430
You...

343
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,790
I transferred you here from the Imperial Guards.

344
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,750
Before learning anything else,

345
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,750
you learned

346
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,730
to be glib.

347
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,470
When Mrs. Ma saw you,

348
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,790
her eyes lit up.

349
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,560
How could you call me glib?

350
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,090
Don't say such things

351
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,090
in front of Xijun.

352
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,250
What did you find just now?

353
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,930
No wonder Mrs. Ma's makeup

354
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,890
is so exquisite.

355
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,110
She has all kinds of lip balms.

356
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,630
But

357
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,010
there's no Black Balm.

358
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,040
Are you sure?

359
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,470
Maybe you were too careless

360
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,230
to find it.

361
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:51,910
Mr. Lu.

362
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,590
I've been working with you

363
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,350
for a month.

364
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,670
I wouldn't make such a mistake.

365
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,150
Go find the source of Black Balm.

366
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,150
All makeup stores

367
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,830
in the East and West Markets

368
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,960
must be checked.

369
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,390
If you miss anything,

370
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,790
I'll give you a hard time.

371
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,150
Yes.

372
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,829
What did you draw?

373
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,630
I also find it strange.

374
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,589
They look like

375
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,349
Mara and the beast Qiongqi

376
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,800
on Qin Xiaobai's mural.

377
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,869
I think you're influenced

378
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,150
by thinking too much

379
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,690
about Qin Xiaobai.

380
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,230
You asked me for help.

381
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,090
If you say sarcastic things again,

382
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,800
I'll leave.

383
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,240
How's the lamp soup?

384
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:44,830
Great.

385
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,830
So great.

386
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,400
I wish I could get

387
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,910
more soup.

388
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,640
How dare you!

389
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,710
The Supreme Court is not

390
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,310
somewhere you can freeload.

391
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,240
You got me wrong.

392
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,160
You got me wrong.

393
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,590
The lady who painted the portrait

394
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,520
offered it to me.

395
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,730
What are you doing?

396
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,280
-Sir.
-Wait.

397
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,870
Answer my questions

398
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,590
honestly.

399
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,570
Have you been to

400
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,710
Chengfo Temple in the past ten days?

401
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,910
I go there every day.

402
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,270
Look.

403
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,770
I guessed it right.

404
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,880
You didn't see

405
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,630
the murderer.

406
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,590
You just described the mural

407
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,070
in Chengfo Temple, right?

408
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,990
Mural?

409
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,750
I heard that some guy

410
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,050
drew a mural there.

411
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,990
But someone like me

412
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,190
doesn't get to see it.

413
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,230
Chengfo Temple's got a new rule:

414
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,550
you gotta donate a fair bit

415
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,990
before they let you in.

416
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,130
Then why do you go there every day?

417
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,250
To sell coal.

418
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,710
Chengfo Temple has been crowded lately.

419
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,870
Many rich people there.

420
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,930
I go there every day

421
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,780
to sell more coal.

422
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,910
What's wrong?

423
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,590
I'm poor,

424
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,230
but I won't come to a government office

425
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,260
for free food.

426
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,090
The thing in the painting

427
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,550
killed the man with a sword.

428
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,310
I saw it.

429
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,230
It was stuffy in the first half of the night,

430
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,910
so I opened the window.

431
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,440
But suddenly,

432
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,310
there was thunder

433
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,550
and lightning.

434
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,190
So I got up to close the window.

435
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,590
I was drowsy,

436
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,920
but the lightning then

437
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,550
made it even brighter than the day.

438
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,500
I was less than 20 steps away

439
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,560
from this monster.

440
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,590
I saw it clearly.

441
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,790
The murderer

442
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,830
was him.

443
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,190
My lady.

444
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,600
You're a great painter.

445
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,070
It's been days.

446
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,030
When will he draw the eyes?

447
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,450
The wine from the Princess' Palace

448
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,950
is almost finished, right?

449
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,280
Why are you hesitating?

450
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,540
The expression is the hardest to draw.

451
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,640
To make the expression vivid,

452
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,770
the eyes are the key.

453
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,720
Mara and Buddha

454
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,190
are not ordinary people.

455
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,270
Their eyes are crucial.

456
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,510
Mr. Qin is hesitating

457
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,130
because he still needs inspiration.

458
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,960
He's responsible for his work.

459
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,610
He…

460
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,670
Hurry up.

461
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,650
Why has he come down again?

462
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,410
When will he draw the eyes?

463
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,390
Get out!

464
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,130
Get all of them out!

465
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,430
Guys.

466
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,310
Master Qin Xiaobai

467
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,620
was ordered by Her Highness

468
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,670
to draw Mara's Defeat in this temple.

469
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,750
Drawing the eyes is critical.

470
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,390
Ladies and gentlemen,

471
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,270
please wait outside the hall.

472
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,790
Please.

473
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,470
Please.

474
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,710
Please go out.

475
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,260
Please.

476
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,230
Please.

477
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:40,890
Please.

478
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,340
[Great Buddha Hall]

479
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,020
Senior,

480
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,830
stop drinking.

481
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,070
Early this morning,

482
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,750
Her Highness sent someone to urge us.

483
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,110
Since you're in good spirits today,

484
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,650
[Zu, Qin Xiaobai's junior fellow disciple]

485
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,990
just draw the eyes.

486
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,710
What's that sound? What's going on?

487
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,750
You bastard!

488
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,290
Who are you to tell me what to do?

489
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,330
Senior, sorry.

490
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,450
I won't do it again.

491
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,270
-I won't do it again.
-Who do you think you are?

492
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,000
Who are you to tell me what to do?

493
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,790
Senior, stop!

494
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,550
I won't do it again.

495
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,610
I won't do it again.

496
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,430
I'm Cen Zhi, the regimental commander of the Princess' Palace.

497
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,710
Is the mural finished?

498
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,110
You...

499
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,270
[Cen Zhi, regimental commander of the Princess' Palace]

500
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,870
Why hasn't he drawn the eyes?

501
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,750
Qin Xiaobai

502
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,170
[Abbot Guangxiao of Chengfo Temple]

503
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,060
is the best mural painter in Tang.

504
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,590
He wants it perfect.

505
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,780
But Her Highness has set a deadline.

506
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,580
It's still half a month

507
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,870
before the deadline.

508
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,040
Please believe in Qin Xiaobai.

509
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,710
He can definitely

510
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,390
finish Mara's Defeat on time

511
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,750
and make Chengfo Temple

512
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,790
the greatest temple

513
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,580
in Chang'an.

514
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,750
You just need to know

515
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,950
if he can't finish it on time,

516
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,590
you'll be beheaded with him.

517
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,110
Amitabha.

518
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,570
This is delicious.

519
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,310
Take a look.

520
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,500
Sachets.

521
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,830
Instead of finishing the mural,

522
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,630
you're enjoying yourself here.

523
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,840
I've never seen a painter like you.

524
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,070
It's you.

525
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,920
You followed me here from Chengfo Temple.

526
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,120
Do you want to be my apprentice?

527
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,670
You're so arrogant.

528
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,070
I'm the Deputy President of the Supreme Court,

529
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,470
Lu Lingfeng from the Lu family of Fanyang.

530
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,690
I'm Detective Di's disciple.

531
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,530
I can't paint,

532
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,520
and I don't deign to learn your little tricks.

533
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,550
The Lu family of Fanyang. Detective Di's disciple.

534
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,750
Impressive.

535
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,360
If you don't want to learn from me,

536
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,950
why are you following me?

537
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,570
Last night,

538
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,000
in Cloud Tower,

539
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,730
did Sun Wang, the Chief Musician,

540
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,060
have a quarrel with you?

541
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,230
A quarrel?

542
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,070
Not really.

543
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,390
He's just a lout.

544
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,310
Ignore him.

545
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,310
He's dead.

546
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,750
What?

547
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,830
A witness said

548
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,840
the thing in this painting

549
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,500
killed Sun Wang on the street.

550
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,210
Who drew this painting?

551
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,500
This painter is talented.

552
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,630
With some guidance,

553
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,270
they can be as famous as me.

554
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,380
Mara will come to life and kill people.

555
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,580
You said that, right?

556
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,790
Did I?

557
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,830
It's not strange

558
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,990
that the demons and monsters

559
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,310
I drew

560
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,530
come to life.

561
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,510
I'm the Best Painter of Tang

562
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,030
I can draw armies for the empire

563
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,190
to fight against enemies

564
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,950
and present gorgeous women

565
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,100
to His Majesty.

566
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,600
Do you admire me?

567
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,590
Tell me

568
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,450
who drew this painting.

569
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,590
No.

570
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,890
It can't be you.

571
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,750
Because you don't have

572
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,190
the vibe of an artist.

573
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:15,790
You…

574
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,190

00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,910
Are there any ghosts?

765
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,990
I don't believe in ghosts.

766
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,390
Why do you ask?

767
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,390
If there are no ghosts at Qianling,

768
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,800
[Crown Prince]

769
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,840
there can't be any in Chang'an.

770
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,290
You're right, Your Highness.

771
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,110
I wonder what the Ministry of Personnel is thinking.

772
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,040
His Majesty has summoned you back,

773
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,390
but they'll only make you

774
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,390
the judicial adjutant of Yongzhou.

775
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,330
Your Highness,

776
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,800
is it really His Majesty

777
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,120
who summoned me back?

778
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,830
Yes.

779
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,440
[Emperor]

780
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,020
The guy guarding Qianling,

781
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,950
what's his name?

782
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,230
Su Wuming.

783
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,550
That's him.

784
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,770
In Sky-scraping Tower,

785
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,430
he had the guts to get in my way.

786
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,870
Very bold.

787
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,280
He's also smart enough to take down Sass.

788
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,080
Tell him to come back

789
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,530
to crack this case.

790
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,750
Su Wuming.

791
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,540
Your teacher, Detective Di,

792
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,110
cracked many mysterious cases

793
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,370
and even saved the country from falling.

794
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,550
Now,

795
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,850
we're counting on you.

796
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,270
Rest assured, Your Highness.

797
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,990
I'll do my best.

798
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,750
Have you brought him back?

799
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,460
[Prime Minister Cui, Secretariat Director]

800
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,150
Yes.

801
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,950
Greetings, Your Highness.

802
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,950
It took you four hours

803
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,530
to come back from Qianling.

804
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,630
I should let you have a good rest,

805
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,440
but the situation is urgent.

806
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,830
Su Wuming.

807
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,110
I order you

808
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
to find my Ji'er as soon as possible.

809
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,680
I don't understand what you mean.

810
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,710
Stop pretending.

811
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,700
Lu Lingfeng is my Ji'er!

812
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,920
He ran into Mara at the Ghost Market

813
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,870
and is nowhere to be found now.

814
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,620
I want you to find Ji'er immediately.

815
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,270
I want him alive.

816
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,080
I want him

817
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,830
safe and sound!

818
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,350
On your way back,

819
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,570
the crown prince's man

820
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,700
must have told you

821
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,870
what happened in Chang'an.

822
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,660
I've had a grasp of it.

823
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,880
What position have they promised you?

824
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,530
The Military Commander of Yongzhou.

825
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,430
I knew it.

826
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,910
To tell you the truth,

827
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,630
it's my idea to make you

828
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,670
the judicial adjutant of Yongzhou.

829
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,390
I just want to see

830
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,070
how the Eastern Palace will bribe you.

831
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,170
Since you've been summoned back by His Majesty,

832
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,790
you should work for the Supreme Court.

833
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,920
Lu Lingfeng has taken office.

834
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,530
But the Supreme Court needs two deputy presidents.

835
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,700
It only has one now.

836
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,760
You'll be the other one.

837
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
You'll take office tonight.

838
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,730
Your Highness.

839
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,000
Isn't it against the rules?

840
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,190
I know you.

841
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,200
I won't make you an informal official.

842
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,070
The appointment will arrive tomorrow at the latest.

843
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,870
The seals of the Secretariat and the Chancellery,

844
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,070
together with His Majesty's stamp,

845
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,830
will all be on it.

846
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,110
[Mortuary]

847
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,180
Kong Mao, a professor at the Imperial College,

848
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,110
died ten days ago

849
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,910
on his way home.

850
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,550
There's no fatal wound on his body

851
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,030
or signs of poisoning.

852
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,870
It looks like he was scared to death.

853
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,110
After he died,

854
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,430
his liver was taken.

855
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,140
He Chi, the Hot Springs Overseer,

856
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,550
was found dead by River Qu eight days ago.

857
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,710
There's no fatal wound either.

858
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,110
His liver was also taken.

859
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,110
Sun Wang, the Chief Musician,

860
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,280
died in Pingkang Fang three days ago.

861
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,780
According to Deputy President Lu,

862
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,840
the fatal wound was caused by a Mo sword.

863
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,450
I agree.

864
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,970
His liver was taken too?

865
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:07,870
Yes.
