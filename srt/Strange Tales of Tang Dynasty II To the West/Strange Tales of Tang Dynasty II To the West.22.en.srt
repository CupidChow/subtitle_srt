00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,800
Who's there?

5
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,870
You're back.

6
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,600
Lu Lingfeng?

7
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,440
When I was down the mountain,

8
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,790
I startled a nest of pheasants,

9
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,260
so I brought several of them back.

10
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,470
Since you weren't home,

11
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,070
I went ahead and stewed them.

12
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,949
Lu Lingfeng.

13
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,400
I heard there are pheasants...

14
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,190
General Lu.

15
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,120
I didn't know you were so capable.

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,720
You even know how to cook now.

17
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,870
It does smell quite good.

18
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,490
When it's ready, bring it over for us.

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,680
Alright, Xijun.

20
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,829
I'm back now, aren't I?

21
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,630
You almost scared me to death.

22
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,130
Don't cry.

23
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,990
Have your late night snack first.

24
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,510
I have something important to ask of you

25
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,790
later.

26
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,830
How could this happen?

27
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,860
Master, there's no need to be angry.

28
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,590
Promoting those who contribute to Taiyin Sect

29
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,790
was my idea.

30
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,590
It's understandable that

31
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,700
Yuan He resorted to this vicious tactic

32
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,230
because he was worried that

33
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,110
I'd take over his position as the lieutenant.

34
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,040
If it weren't for the fact that we are short-staffed,

35
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,579
I would throw him into the Delicacy Cave right away.

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,470
That Lu Lingfeng

37
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,600
actually managed to escape death.

38
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,410
If we don't kill him, he'll become a big trouble.

39
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,950
I actually brought him into the mountains this time

40
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,910
to test him.

41
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,320
The conclusion is,

42
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,910
this person is definitely not sent by the court

43
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,750
against us.

44
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,870
If you misjudged him,

45
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,590
do you know what the consequences will be?

46
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,300
Of course.

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,620
I, Linghu Shuo, am willing to stake my life on it that

48
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,020
Lu Lingfeng

49
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,390
can be trusted.

50
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,790
Why did you risk your life to save me?

51
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,350
Hasn't it ever occurred to you that

52
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,390
if I go back alive,

53
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,310
Taiyin Sect won't let you go?

54
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,470
But if you fell to your death,

55
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,930
who would take me to see the real sect leader?

56
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,750
Your identity as a spy has been exposed.

57
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,230
Stop lying.

58
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,110
Who said I'm a spy?

59
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,100
Chang'an is expecting my head.

60
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,870
Even if Mount Taiyin is wiped out,

61
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,600
the credit will still go to the state government.

62
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,010
The court still won't believe me.

63
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,470
If I, Lu Lingfeng,

64
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,650
want to achieve something great,

65
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,650
I definitely can't rely on the court of Tang.

66
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,470
It's a pity that all the blood and tears

67
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,930
I shed for Tang was a waste.

68
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,050
So why didn't you draw

69
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,720
the Map of Western Region's Troop Locations just now?

70
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,430
Firstly,

71
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,350
I don't believe that bald man is the sect leader.

72
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:46,950
Secondly,

73
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,070
although I have the map of troop locations memorized,

74
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,070
I couldn't draw it

75
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,770
because I simply don't know how to paint.

76
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,190
Among those who came to Hanzhou with him,

77
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,990
there's a woman named Pei Xijun.

78
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,790
She's good at Danqing,

79
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,320
and she and Lu Lingfeng can read each other's minds.

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,580
She can draw it for him.

81
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,910
If that's really the case, it would be great.

82
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,710
We agreed to meet

83
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,870
at Tianbao Restaurant in 2 days.

84
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,670
By then,

85
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,120
if he still can't hand over the map,

86
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,590
I know what to do.

87
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,690
I know it takes at least 2 days

88
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,560
for an ordinary person to do such a painting.

89
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,350
But this map concerns

90
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,610
the safety of Hanzhou,

91
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,970

92
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,750
I hope you can finish it

Don't distract Xijun.

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920

from 18 years ago

118

when Taiyin Sect was exterminated.

119

Where did you get it?

The mastermind behind the rebellion at that time

123
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,050
was the great-grandson of Duan Gui.

124
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,970
After he was executed by the court,

125
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,070
there was no more rebellion of Taiyin Sect

Among the rebels at that time,

129
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,190
there was a seven-year-old girl

130
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,150
who escaped.

131
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,910
She was the daughter of the so-called sect leader.

132
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,870
This little girl rode a saw-toothed rhino

133

and escaped deep into the mountains.

134
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,240
It was later rumored that

135
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,950
she was adopted by a huntsman surnamed Song.

136
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,080
After that, the government troops searched in the mountains for many years,

137
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,200
but they never found this

138
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,710

160

I just drew a few strokes in a hurry.

161
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,520
I wouldn't consider it as some contribution.

189
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,030
What brings you here so early in the morning?

190
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,150
Come on. Come in for some tea.

191
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,150
Su Wuming.

192
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,270
I'm not here to exchange pleasantries with you.

193
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,670
Tell Lu Lingfeng to come out and surrender.

194
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,330
Otherwise,

195
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,320
there'll be consequences.

196
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,310
Ma Meng.

197
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,960
I'm Su Wuming, disciple of Detective Di.

198
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
May I have a word with you in private?

199
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,730
You are Di Renjie's disciple?

200
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,110
I, Su, am incompetent.

201
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,740
At this critical moment,

202
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,710
I have to invoke my respected teacher's name.

203
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,910
Please, Minister Ma.

204
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,970
Come inside for some tea.

205
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,240
Don't shoot the arrows.

206
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,680
I've held Ma Meng,

207
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,260
Judicial Adjutant of Hanzhou, hostage.

208
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,670
If you don't want him to die,

209
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,590
make way.

210
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,860
Make way!

211
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,510
Make way! Come on, make way!

212
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,240
[Long's Residence]

213
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,910
Move!

214
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,870
What are you waiting for? Run!

215
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,750
Come on, hurry.

216
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,810
Tell your men not to chase us.

217
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,550
If you don't want to die,

218
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,680
don't come after us.

219
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,150
Don't chase them!

220
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,040
Watch out for an ambush.

221
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,970
What... What's wrong, Ami?

222
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,030
I had a nightmare.

223
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,350
It was so scary.

224
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,510
I dreamed that

225
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,310
you punched him to death,

226
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,840
and his brain splattered everywhere.

227
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,190
How could that be?

228
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,630
Didn't you tell me

229
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,590
he ran away to avoid the creditors?

230
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,810
Come on, let me rub your feet.

231
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,410
No need.

232
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,780
I've seen with my own eyes

233
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,930
that you punched someone to death before.

234
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,950
I'm scared.

235
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,470
Don't worry.

236
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,920
I kill with my left hand,

237
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,950
but I care for you with my right hand.

238
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,080
Let me rub your feet.

239
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,310
I'll be gentle.

240
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,550
I have some good news.

241
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,190
Do you want to know?

242
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,590
What is it?

243
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,350
I told you before that

244
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,000
an army of 100,000 men

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,830
is no match for a single brilliant general.

246
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,510
Now,

247
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,380
that brilliant general has come to me

248
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,510
with a valuable map.

249
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,790
With this map,

250
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,550
I can gain the allegiance of thousands of troops and horses of the Western Region.

251
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,050
I don't understand these things,

252
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,040
and I don't want to know either.

253
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,870
[Two hours ago]

254
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,670
Why should I trust you?

255
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,670
I'll entrust these 4 maps

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,390
to you, Minister Ma.

257
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,210
How do I know

258
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,240
if they are real or fake?

259
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,550
Lu Lingfeng risked his life

260
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,950
to get these.

261
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,470
How can you doubt him?

262
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,550
That's what all liars say.

263
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,150
-How could you…
-Xijun.

264
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,210
Since Minister Ma doesn't even believe

265
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,590
the Arming Map of Taiyin,

266
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,650
he definitely won't recognize

267
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,850
Censor Xie's letter.

268
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,750
I want that other thing.

269
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,090
This is Master Moshi's tongue relic.

270
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,090
The other half of it is in Hanzhou.

271
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,600
The first time we met

272
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,110
was at Hui'an Temple.

273
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,170
I, Lu, was entrusted by the sheriff of Shen County,

274
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,170
Jiang Wei,

275
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,950
to reunite the two halves of

276
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,990
this ultimate treasure.

277
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,610
I'm willing to entrust this treasure

278
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,950
to you, Minister Ma.

279
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,600
Can you trust me now?

280
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,550
Please don't.

281
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,250
Master Moshi's tongue relic is an ultimate treasure.

282
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,200
Of course I, Ma Meng,

283
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,350
am well aware of the value of it.

284
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,840
You have this treasure,

285
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,230
yet you didn't exchange it for money.

286
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,790
I, Ma Meng,

287
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,710
can trust you now.

288
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,250
Sheriff Lu.

289
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,710
I'll follow your plan.

290
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,790
Sheriff Lu. Mr. Su.

291
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,390
What's our plan next?

292
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,830
Hand over the maps.

293
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,110
Minister Ma, please hand the maps

294
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,260
directly to the prefectural governor.

295
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,790
As for how you obtained the maps,

296
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,510
there's no need to mention me, Lu Lingfeng.

297
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,770
The credit for wiping out the Taiyin Sect

298
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,240
will all go to you, Minister Ma.

299
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,730
Sheriff Lu.

300
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,110
What kind of person do you think I am?

301
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,540
Minister Ma.

302
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,990
Lu Lingfeng is just worried that if the state government

303
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,950
finds out about the origin of these maps,

304
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,190
not only will they not believe it,

305
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,950
but they'll also accuse him

306
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,290
of colluding with the Taiyin Sect

307
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,490
and punish him for it.

308
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,550
How is that possible?

309
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,430
Some things have happened in Chang'an.

310
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,550
I can't explain it to you

311
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,610
in just a few words.

312
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,590
Just do as Lu Lingfeng says.

313
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,990
The people of Hanzhou

314
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,840
will be grateful to you.

315
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,440
Minister Ma.

316
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,430
Please wait.

317
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,920
Minister Ma.

318
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,790
I have one more request.

319
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,050
Please go ahead, Mr. Su.

320
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,050
Here's the thing.

321
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,510
I'm looking for a person.

322
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,680
To be precise, a dead person,

323
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,560
who died just a couple of days ago.

324
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,540
I know you're busy

325
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,910
and you have great responsibilities on your shoulders.

326
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,790
But could you spare me a few men?

327
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,110
I need to find

328
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,440
that person's corpse as soon as possible.

329
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,750
Okay.

330
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,430
I will put

331
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,740
all the trusted undercover detectives in Hanzhou City

332
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,030
at your disposal, Mr. Su.

333
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,050
[Troop Locations and Arming Map of Mount Taiyin]

334
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,310
It's depicted in such detail.

335
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,950
Who drew this?

336
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,710
It was drawn by an undercover detective who I've been cultivating for a long time.

337
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,950
He pretended to join them a few months ago.

338
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,150
After many twists and turns,

339
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,260
he finally managed to get into

340
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,670
the heartland of Mount Taiyin

341
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,510
and got a clear picture of

342
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,200
the lair of Taiyin Sect.

343
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,400
What about Lu Lingfeng,

344
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,390
who was kidnapped by the members of Taiyin Sect

345
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,470
yesterday?

346
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,990
My undercover detective said that

347
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,550
he already defected to Taiyin Sect

348
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,750
and gained their appreciation.

349
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,830
He now lives on Mount Taiyin.

350
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,990
So what's your plan, Minister Ma?

351
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,710
Although we've got these maps,

352
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,690
I don't think

353
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,160
we should rush into the mountain to encircle and suppress them.

354
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,590
We should first order the nearby prefectures and counties

355
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,110
to cooperate in investigating the Taiyin Sect's accomplices,

356
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,270
and figure out how many people

357
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,590
are there who are determined

358
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,650
to rebel with them.

359
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,320
We should also mobilize

360
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,350
all the huntsmen in nearby prefectures and counties

361
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,590
to guard against numerous beasts on Mount Taiyin.

362
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,190
Then, when the time is right,

363
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,270
we'll join forces with the Commandery

364
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,480
and send troops together.

365
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,590
We will definitely wipe out Mount Taiyin in one attempt

366
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,250
and bring hundreds of years of peace to Hanzhou.

367
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,990
Minister Ma.

368
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,650
Haven't you always advocated

369
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,270
marching into the mountains to suppress the bandits?

370
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,510
Now that we've got the maps,

371
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,150
why are you not in a hurry anymore?

372
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,590

I've always been better at studying than others since I was little.

533

534
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,870
I couldn't stand reading them,

535

except Duan Gui's books.

536
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,790

537
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,590
that I never get tired of reading.

538
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,850
Especially after he broke his right arm.

539
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,710
He killed many generals of the court of Tang

541

Every time I read that part,

542
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,140
my blood would race with excitement.

543
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,510
At that time,

544
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,870
I was already in my 90s.

545
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,700
What I was most anxious about was that

546
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,280
I couldn't convince the sect leader

547

548

If it weren't for you,

549
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,640
how could we have

551
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,000
and recruited our members after that?

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,400
No.

561
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,090
This might actually be

562
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,830
our opportunity.

563
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,620
Master.

564
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,070
Master.

565
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,590
Bad news!

566
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,480
What's all the panic about?

567
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,670
Linghu Shuo is actually not dead.

568
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,550
He betrayed the Taiyin Sect.

569
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,230
I heard

570
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,390
he even drew a map of Mount Taiyin.

571
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,910
Now the government troops

572
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,570
are already on their way up the mountain.

573
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,600
It's good news.

574
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,350
Good?

575
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,150
The terrain of Mount Taiyin is complex.

576
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,510
Once the government troops march deep into the heartland,

577
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,670
it won't be easy

578
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,090
for them to get out.

579
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,070
Have you got the people

580
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,390
I asked you to find

581
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,390
to spread the word that

582
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,430
Taiyin Sect is going to attack Hanzhou Granary?

583
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,410
Yes. I've got

584
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,440
over 100 people.

585
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,860
Just give the order.

586
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,210
In less than 2 hours,

587
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,150
the word will be spread throughout the whole city.

588
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,830
How many animal bone arrows

589
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,030
have been made?

590
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,510
There should be around 80,000 to 90,000 in total.

591
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,870
How many have been transported out of the city?

592
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,510
70,000.

593
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,070
That's enough.

594
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,760
Pass on my order.

595
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,200
Sect Leader has decided

596
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,530
to take action tonight

597
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,480
and attack Hanzhou City.

598
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,260
T... Tonight?

599
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,850
Yes, tonight.

600
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,820
I am Prefectural Governor, Liao Xin.

601
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,350
I am Administrator, Tian Chou.

602
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,150
-Greetings, Commander.
-Greetings, Commander.

603
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,350
You came together.

604
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,690
What's the matter?

605
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,480
Tian Chou.

606
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,590
Come on. Tell the Commander.

607
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,310
We have received information that

608
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,070
It's said that the villains of Taiyin Sect

609
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,330
are planning to attack Hanzhou Granary.

610
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,870
Is this information accurate?

611
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,030
Absolutely.

612
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,520
But 2 hours ago,

613
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,610
I received the news

614
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,150
that the state government has already

615
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,610
redeployed all the troops

616
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,290
stationing Hanzhou Granary.

617
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,750
This...

618
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,720
Governor Liao, you should know about this.

619
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,280
You...

620
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,480
It was indeed I who redeployed the troops.

621
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,790
At that time, we had not yet received the information

622
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,030
that Taiyin Sect was planning to attack Hanzhou Granary.

623
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,950
As the Prefectural Governor of Hanzhou,

624
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,650
Taiyin Sect

625
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,900
has been my greatest worry.

626
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,590
It's my dream

627
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,750
to wipe them out.

628
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Fortunately, Judicial Adjutant Ma Meng

629
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,670
has been working diligently.

630
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,870
The undercover detective he dispatched

631
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,070
risked his life

632
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,390
infiltrating Mount Taiyin

633
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,900
and obtained the map of Taiyin,

634
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,430
as well as the rebels' arming deployment map.

635
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,480
Therefore, I immediately sent troops

636
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,680
to enter the mountain for suppression.

637
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,650
Commander.

638
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,590
I made a mistake.

639
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,760
It shouldn't be considered a mistake.

640
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,310
It's just that

641
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,640
the Hanzhou Granary 10 miles away

642
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,020
is the largest granary in the northwest.

643
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,949
Once attacked,

644
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,070
especially if

645
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,510
the rebels were to maliciously set fire to it

646
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,370
and burn all the grain and fodder,

647
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,300
the consequences would be unimaginable.

648
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,449
Indeed.

649
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,070
Therefore, as soon as I received the information,

650
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,870
I rushed over here immediately.

651
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,389
The Hanzhou Granary

652
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,630
is originally under the joint guard

653
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,469
of the Commandery and the state government.

654
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,469
At this critical juncture,

655
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,870
I hope you can dispatch some troops to support us, Commander.

656
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,710
I do have

657
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,980
the troops.

658
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,760
But who should lead them...

659
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,750
I'll hand the important task of guarding Hanzhou Granary

660
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,280
over to you, Governor Liao.

661
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,710
As the Prefectural Governor of Hanzhou,

662
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,300
during this time when the rebels are causing chaos,

663
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,730
I should stand fast in Hanzhou

664
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,989
and not leave the city.

665
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,610
I recommend Administrator Tian to lead the troops.

666
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,960
What?

667
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,290
You also want to decline, Administrator Tian?

668
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,110
I dare not.

669
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,700
But I'm worried that I'm not up to the task.

670
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,150
I know you have never led troops before,

671
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,750
so I will ask a capable general

672
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,790
to assist you.

673
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,470
-We'll see ourselves out, Commander.
-We'll see ourselves out, Commander.

674
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,110
Please.

675
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,830
You can come out now.

676
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,930
Commander.

677
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,250
Follow me.

678
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,590
Look.

679
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,750
10 months.

680
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,750
9 pieces per month.

681
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,890
90 pieces in total.

682
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,320
That was the third day

683
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,150
when I first arrived in Hanzhou.

684
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,490
Who's that?

685
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,710
Taiyin Sect.

686
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,700
Greetings.

687
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,430
This little thief is quite bold.

688
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,840
His qinggong is mediocre, though.

689
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,470
He brought 9 gold coins here every time.

690
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,470
I knew it early on

691
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,730
that he embezzled one piece for himself.

692
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,220
Don't you want evidence?

693
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,240
This is the evidence

694
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,070
of me taking bribes.

695
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,920
Last time, it was because I was in urgent need to see you

696
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,720
that I offended you, Commander.

697
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,670
Please forgive me, Commander.

698
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,310
Do you think

699
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,430
that I would work for the Taiyin Sect

700
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,360
just for some gold coins?

701
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,430
Of course not.

702
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,790
Otherwise, you wouldn't have given me

703
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,030
the file on the annihilation of the Taiyin Sect back then

704
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,110
to read.

705
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,790
Since I started working as a government official,

706
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,340
I haven't made any significant contributions,

707
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,800
yet I hold a high position.

708
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,150
Su Wuming.

709
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,750
You don't think

710
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,110
I got this position

711
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,980
by taking bribes and then bribing my higher-ups,

712
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,540
do you?

713
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Do you know that I am from Jiangdong,

714
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,290
and I'm a descendant of the Lu family of Wu Commandery?

715
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,430
I see.

716
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,810
The 4 prominent families of the Wu Commandery

717
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,750
are Gu, Lu, Zhu, and Zhang.

718
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,290
Everyone knows that.

719
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,260
One of my ancestors

720
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,410
was also a commander.

721
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,350
Was he the one who set fire to the enemies' fleet

722
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,490
during the Battle of Yiling,

723
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,400
the world-renowned Lu Xun,

724
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,950
Grand Commander Lu Boyan?

725
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,670
My apologies. My apologies.

726
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,090
At the beginning of the Tang Dynasty,

727
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,950
Duan Gui rebelled and got killed.

728
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,590
His descendants

729
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,500
established the Taiyin Sect.

730
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,950
It has persisted for 100 years despite repeated suppression.

731
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,970
Recently, they have even rebuilt their stronghold

732
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,550
and deceived tens of thousands of people

733
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,260
to go into the mountains for cultivation.

734
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,660
Once they grow powerful,

735
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
they'll certainly endanger our state.

736
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,830
We need to annihilate them once and for all.

737
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,150
Although it's no match for my ancestor's

738
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,150
Battle of Yiling,

739
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,770
it should still count as an achievement, right?

740
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,890
That goes without saying.

741
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,220
If I had captured

742
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,510
that little thief delivering gold coins the first time I met him,

743
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,230
I'm afraid

744
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,410
we wouldn't have made it to today.

745
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,910
Commander, your camouflage is brilliant,

746
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,270
and your strategic planning is remarkable.

747
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,670
I, Su, admire you.

748
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,580
However,

749
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,830
the power of the Taiyin Sect

750
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,000
should not be underestimated.

751
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,680
Please enlighten me with the details.

752
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,540
Animal  bones?

753
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,950
It's not like we're living in

754
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,550
the age of savagery anymore.

755
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,710
I'm afraid this is fearmongering, isn't it?

756
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,420
When the new Emperor ascended the throne,

757
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,760
he immediately issued the Iron Restriction Order,

758
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,420
aiming to create a safe realm where

759
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,950
one can travel a thousand miles without carrying a weapon.

760
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,610
Therefore,

761
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,790
it's hard for the Taiyin Sect

762
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,750
to forge weapons

763
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,370
since they can't get iron.

764
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,040
This has been confirmed

765
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,940
when Lu Lingfeng

766
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,430
investigated the smithy.

767
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,130
But it's said that in the Han dynasty, nomadic tribes

768
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,810
used to make arrowheads with animal bones,

769
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,820
which could pierce the throat with one shot.

770
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,070
It was even more powerful even iron and steel.

771
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,450
Although I, Su, have only been in Hanzhou for a few days,

772
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,630
I have visited an Animal Bone Yard.

773
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,530
A large number of animal bones

774
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,790
were transported out of the Animal Bone Yard.

775
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,830
For what purpose?

776
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,510
I can't help but worry about it.

777
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,790
Taiyin Sect

778
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,650
has always acted in strange ways.

779
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,010
It's quite possible they are using animal bones to make arrows.

780
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,140
In the past 10 months,

781
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,330
I have sent out many undercover detectives,

782
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,870
but I have not been able to ascertain

783
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,310
the true identity of

784
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,670
the Taiyin Sect Leader.

785
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,390
Besides, what's so special about this sect leader

786
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,750
that can make the sect members so fiercely loyal?

787
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,020
This hasn't been figured out yet either.

788
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,360
The safety of Hanzhou

789
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,250
is still uncertain.

790
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:49,450
[Miaose Dyeing Workshop]

791
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,080
Why did you come back again?

792
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,650
Didn't you already

793
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,910
make up your mind?

794
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,370
The door is not locked.

795
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,710
Come in.

796
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,070
Linghu Shuo.

797
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,650
What do you want?

798
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,700
What?

799
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,830
Since I'm not Linghu Shuo,

800
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,150
you wouldn't let me in?

801
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,990
You're more than capable to walk.

802
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,990
Who said you couldn't come in?
