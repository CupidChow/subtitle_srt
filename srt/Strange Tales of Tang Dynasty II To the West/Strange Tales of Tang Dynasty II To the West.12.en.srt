00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,550
Ma Huai.

5
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,720
In that case,

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,990
you're a nice person.

7
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,720
But you strangled Lou Qingtai.

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,570
This is a capital offense.

9
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,370
By the way, Ma Huai,

10
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,870
I remember you said

11
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,840
the first time you left the burial goods store...

12
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,300
That's exactly what the situation was.

13
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,400
When you went to stole from the burial goods store,

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,450
you also crossed the backyard, right?

15
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,530
Steal?

16
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,950
Backyard?

17
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,270
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,000
The scribe recorded it clearly

19
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,870
that when you were interrogated last time, you said...

20
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,070
I was on duty last night.

21
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,590
I left the government office at 9:30 p.m.

22
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,430
I arrived at the burial goods store at 9:45 p.m. at most.

23
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,140
I said a few words and left.

24
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,550
Right.

25
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,930
But I asked your friend

26
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,070
who was on duty with you that day.

27
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,310
Yes.

28
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,160
It was Officer Niu that day.

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,640
No, Niu Daming.

30
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,470
He was on duty.

31
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,570
Magistrate is so easy-going.

32
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,790
He invited a coroner to drink alcohol.

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,280
It's going to rain.

34
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,960
It should be fine today.

35
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,890
Keep an eye out.

36
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,010
I'm very sleepy.

37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,590
I'm going to find a place to sleep.

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,080
Yes.

39
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,350
You didn't go to sleep.

40
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,110
Instead, you went to the burial goods store

41
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,390
while Dugu Yang was away.

42
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:19,990
Nonsense!

43
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,850
What proof do you have?

44
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,190
Your shoes are quite new.

45
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,329
The old ones are at your house.

46
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,730
You didn't have time to wash them, right?

47
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,110
I found these at your house.

48
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,710
If you hadn't gone to the backyard of the burial goods store

49
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,770
on the rainy night,

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,710
how could the shoes be covered

51
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,480
with so much clay

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,010
exclusively used for making clay figurines?

53
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,400
No, I didn't.

54
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,350
I had no reason to go to the burial goods store.

55
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,350
For the Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal.

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,440
When I captured you, you said...

57
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,700
That seal has killed several people.

58
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,870
But no one has ever seen it.

59
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,790
I think

60
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,140
it's a lie

61
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,950
that Dugu Yang

62
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,880
told to his wife.

63
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,250
There is no such thing in the world at all.

64
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,290
I didn't expect

65
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,750
that I would also be tricked

66
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,150
after working in the government office for many years.

67
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,790
You were tricked by Dugu Yang

68
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,440
when you were following Chuntiao, right?

His entire Treasure Pavilion

72
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,839
isn't worth my seal.

73
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,800
The poor coroner has such a treasure?

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,720
Even though I went there, I didn't kill anyone.

75
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,290
Did I ever say you killed someone?

76
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,909
When you were imprisoned,

77
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,260
you didn't see

78
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,390
Lou Qingtai's body.

79
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,180
I just deliberately said

80
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,640
that Lou Qingtai has died.

81
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,890
But you weren't surprised at all.

82
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,030
You're

83
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,970
the person who killed Lou Qingtai.

What is this?

87
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,940
This is what I drew

88
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,390
based on what Qingniao said.

89
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,050
Niu Daming.

90
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,710
That day, Qingniao went to look for his brother

91

in the rain.

92
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,630
But she found you coming out of the backyard.

93
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,700
She was so scared that she ran back home in a hurry.

94
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,480
That's why she missed the chance

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,610
to find his brother.

96
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,350
She...

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,630
She's slandering me.

98

on what kind of torture

107

After I sneaked into the burial goods store,

110
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,310
I searched everywhere.

111

But I couldn't find that seal.

112
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,830
Suddenly, I heard some noise outside the window.

But you...

119

and Dugu Yang

122

who performed a fake autopsy.

123
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,230
I won't tell anyone

124
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,560
about you being a thief.

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,690
Okay.

Chunshan used the chance to sneak into the burial goods store.

152
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,790
Chunshan found some copper coins

153
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,310
but was scared away

154
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,070
by the noise in the backyard.

155
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,080
It was Ma Huai who came to deliver clay.

156
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,450

He killed Lou Qingtai.

he found Lou Qingtai's body.

172

He thought he was the murderer.

173
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,400
In a panic,

174
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,790
he used the clay figurine to hide the body.

175

Next,

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,100
Then, you lost your gambling tool

193
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,800
in the fight with Lu Er,

194
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,910
which exposed your whereabouts.

195
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,360
I know your family was rich before.

196
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,310
It's gambling that made you poor.

197
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,720
If it weren't for Dugu Yang's help,

198
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,550
you would have starved to death.

199
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,850
You're ungrateful

200
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,900
and even tried to blackmail him.

201
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,590
You're

202
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,950
such a rat.

203
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:11,910
You...

204
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,430
Mother.

205
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,630
Calm down.

206
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,460
Sit down.

207
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,310
Sit down and listen to him.

208
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,630
He's analyzing the case now.

209
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,020
What he said may not be true.

210
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,270
It may not be true.

211
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,390
Mother.

212
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,320
Lu Lingfeng.

213
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,430
Go on.

214
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,820
Then,

215
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,550
Dugu Yang gave a silver ingot to Chunshan

216
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,950
and asked him to leave Shiyang.

217
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,750
After that, he hid the body with the clay figurine.

218
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,320
At this time,

219
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,130
you came to the burial goods store again,

220
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
probably regretting not handling

221
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,300
Lou Qingtai's body better.

222
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,310
You tried to test

223
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,540
whether Dugu Yang had found it out.

224
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,610
Why are you still here so late?

225
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,310
Aren't you afraid

226
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,170
that your wife will sleep with someone else?

227
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,930
Okay.

228
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,390
You're right again.

229
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,090
After Niu Daming left,

230
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,650
you, Boss Dong,

231
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,910
came to talk business.

232
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,030
I left home at 9:45 p.m.

233
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,110
It took at most seven minutes and 30 seconds to get to the burial goods store.

234
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,030
Dugu Yang promised

235
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,260
to sell the Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal to me.

236
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,630
I went home happily

237
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,600
to get the money.

238
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,140
When I came back,

239
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,370
he already died.

240
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,780
I, Dong Haogu, am telling the truth.

241
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,340
Niu Daming.

242
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,310
The third time you sneaked into the burial goods store,

243
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,510
you killed Dugu Yang.

244
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,030
Was it for Chuntiao

245
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,480
or that seal?

246
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,190
I...

247
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,910
No, I didn't.

248
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,920
Here you are.

249
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,870
We also have the night watchman, Uncle Zhong, as the witness.

250
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,270
You still want to deny it?

251
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,600
Uncle Zhong was talking nonsense.

252
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,390
Indeed, I went back to the burial goods store again.

253
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,590
I also thought about killing Dugu Yang.

254
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,590
But...

255
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,570
But Dugu Yang wasn't there.

256
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,850
Lou Qingtai's body

257
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,090
also disappeared.

258
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,790
Nonsense.

259
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,110
There were many paper people and paper horses there.

260
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,350
Even if, as you said,

261
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,230
Dugu Yang wasn't in the store at that time,

262
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,230
how could he not put out the candles?

263
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,170
This...

264
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,580
I don't know.

265
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,540
You wanted to get the seal

266
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,830
and lusted for Chuntiao because of her beauty.

267
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,070
After killing Dugu Yang,

268
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,430
you put the murder weapon in the hand of the clay figurine.

269
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,470
There was no sheriff in Shiyang County before.

270
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,710
Once there were murder cases,

271
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,390
they would be given to you to deal with.

272
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,370
You wanted

273
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,070
to cover up the case by saying

274
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,200
that the clay figurine killed people.

275
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,320
Unfortunately,

276
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,270
the newly appointed Magistrate Dugu

277
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,770
investigated the case personally.

278
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,950
His old friend also came a long way

279
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,990
to help him.

280
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,630
You failed.

281
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,690
Killing one people

282
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,750
costs my head.

283
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,510
Killing two people also costs my head.

284
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,390
Why would I deny it?

285
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,490
Magistrate Dugu. Assistant Xu.

286
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
That's all I can think of.

287
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,090
Whether Niu Daming will confess

288
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,670
depends on your methods.

289
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,030
As a person from the government office,

290
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,690
Niu Daming,

291
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,010
you're greedy and lustful.

292
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,870
You killed two people overnight.

293
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,640
Guards! Drag him out!

294
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,390
Beat him!

295
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,750
Beat him until his skin splits open! Beat him...

296
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,350
Beat him until he confesses!

297
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,320
Yes.

298
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,150
Wait.

299
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,070
Magistrate Dugu.

300
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,100
Why don't you invite Uncle Zhong here

301
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,010
and ask him to confront Niu Daming

302
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,110
on the spot?

303
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,400
If the scribe's record is correct,

304
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,800
Uncle Zhong

305
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,280
has already testified against Niu Daming in court last time.

306
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,920
Did you forget about it

307
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,030
because of your injury?

308
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,610
I didn't forget.

309
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,640
But this thing matters.

310
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,320
It would be safer to invite him here

311
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,580
to confront Niu Daming

312
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,270
on the spot.

313
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,870
Magistrate Dugu.

314
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,710
Bring the witness, Uncle Zhong.

315
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,120
Uncle Zhong.

316
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,270
It's him.

317
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,790
It's him who killed Coroner Dugu.

318
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,110
No.

319
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,750
Uncle Zhong.

320
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,820
Niu Daming has already confessed.

321
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,070
The murderer will pay with his life.

322
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,110
You've had your revenge.

323
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,190
Really?

324
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,880
Uncle Zhong.

325
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,460
You have a vendetta against Niu Daming?

326
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,240
I...

327
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,030
No.

328
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,270
He...

329
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,560
He's the murderer.

330
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,780
Committing perjury in court

331
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,510
is a serious offense, Uncle Zhong.

332
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,540
I...

333
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,600
I'm not afraid of death,

334
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,310
as long as I can see Niu Daming

335
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,150
be beheaded with my own eyes.

336
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,120
Zhong.

337
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,390
What grudge do you have against me?

338
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,870
That day,

339
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,480
you testified against Niu Daming.

340
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,550
That night, Magistrate Dugu and I

341
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,950
went to the burial goods store again.

342
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,390
He's the one who lied.

343
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,360
It was clear that night.

344
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,900
The moon was big and bright.

345
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,350
But I didn't see

346
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,640
where the body was.

347
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,360
But where you were was...

348
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,510
Uncle Zhong.

349
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,310
Why did you lie?

350
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,670
I... I... I...

351
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,430
I just

352
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,869
want to avenge my younger brother's death.

353
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,490
Last year, there was a thief in Shiyang City.

354
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,480
A few days later,

355
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,230
my brother's body

356
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,619
was hung on the city tower

357
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,619
in public.

358
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,750
Uncle Xun?

359
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,270
Uncle Xun was your younger brother?

360
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,660
But you didn't have the same surname.

361
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,260
We were both night watchmen.

362
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,430
We already became brothers with different surnames.

363
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,690
Just because my brother loved drinking,

364
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,800
he lost his job as a night watchman.

365
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,650
You couldn't catch the thief,

366
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,680
so you made my brother a scapegoat.

367
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,560
Do you admit it?

368
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,350
I...

369
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,950
I still remember the theft case

370
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,790
last year.

371
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,250
Niu Daming.

372
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,280
You even asked the government office

373
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,810
for a reward of 3,000 coins.

374
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:49,790
Yes.

375
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,670
So what?

376
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,660
There was no thief.

377
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,590
They were all stolen by me.

378
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,060
Didn't he already take them away?

379
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,250
Bring the stolen things here.

380
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,640
But who killed my son?

381
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,990
Madam, don't worry.

382
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,150
The answer

383
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,360
should be hidden in Uncle Zhong's heart.

384
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,110
Coroner Dugu.

385
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,050
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,900
You asked me to testify against Dong Haogu.

387
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:42,870
I...

388
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,350
But I was selfish.

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,290
Testify against me?

390
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,330
What do you mean?

391
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,410
Shut up!

392
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,880
If you hadn't wanted

393
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,630
to take the Dugu Xin Multifaceted Seal for yourself,

394
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,110
the serial murder

395
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,500
wouldn't have happened.

396
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,760
Uncle Zhong.

397
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,850
Please tell the truth.

398
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,230
Okay.

399
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,820
I'll tell you.

400
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,510
After my brother died,

401
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,480
Dugu Yang

402
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,710
was my only friend.

403
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,030
That day,

404
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,550
I passed by the burial goods store again

405
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,350
and wanted to ask for some water.

406
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,600
Niu Daming was foul-mouthed.

407
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,430
He also said Chuntiao and Dong Haogu

408
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,470
slept together

409
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,440
and got caught in bed by him.

410
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,780
That's not true!

411
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,360
Niu Daming, you're shameless!

412
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,400
Niu!

413
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,070
You...

414
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,730
Stop!

415
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,360
I do like Chuntiao,

416
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,390
but I'm not as dirty as you!

417
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,940
I made it up. So what?

418
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,180
If Dugu Yang had been fooled

419
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,370
and killed you,

420
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,710
Chuntiao

421
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,190
would be mine.

422
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,110
Dugu Yang was really fooled.

423
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,960
Unfortunately,

424
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,860
coroners can't kill people.

425
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,150
Coroners cannot kill people.

426
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,310
Coroners can't kill people.

427
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,750
Coroners are only responsible for autopsies.

428
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,260
We can't kill anyone.

429
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,590
Whatever the reason,

430
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,670
people who break this rule

431
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,350
should

432
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,280
commit suicide on the same day.

433
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,390
This is a rule of this industry.

434
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,020
In order to save Chunshan,

435
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,510
Dugu Yang killed Lu Er

436
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,640
in an emergency.

437
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,830
He knew Lu Er was a tomb robber.

438
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,430
If he had reported the crime in time,

439
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,250
he could have been exempted from the death penalty.

440
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,360
But in Dugu Yang's heart,

441
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,510
it was hard for him to break the rule

442
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,460
of coroners.

443
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,580
He hid the body with the clay figurine

444
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,050
and asked Chunshan to leave Shiyang.

445
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,950
He tried to cover it up,

446
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:25,530
but...

447
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,810
Dugu Yang, who killed Lu Er,

448
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,800
was forced into a desperate situation

449
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,410
by the rule of coroners.

450
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,430
In a trance,

451
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,020
he was stimulated by the dirty words

452
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,480
made up by Niu Daming.

453
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,670
I've

454
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,350
never met Coroner Dugu,

455
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,470
but at this moment,

456
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,790
I can feel the pain

457
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,870
in his heart.

458
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,580
At this moment,

459
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,840
Dong Haogu came to buy the seal.

460
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,390
You came at a bad time.

461
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,970
Convert all the money into silver ingots.

462
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,900
Bring them to me

463
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,950
by 1 o'clock tonight.

464
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,070
You want it tonight?

465
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,730
Forget it if you have no money.

466
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,890
No. Wait for me.

467
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,960
I'll go get them.

468
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,150
At this moment, Dugu Yang

469
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,190
was in a trance.

470
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,290
But he had to do one thing.

471
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,090
One thing

472
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,420
which was very important to him.

473
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,720
So when he left

474
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,080
the burial goods store,

475
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,310
he didn't put out the candles.

476
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,030
And when Niu Daming

477
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,120
came to the burial goods store for the third time,

478
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,400
he found that there was no one

479
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,280
in the store.

480
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,110
Su Wuming.

481
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,470
What on earth

482
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,790
did Dugu Yang do?

483
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,390
Madam.

484
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,250
When Dugu Yang brought Lou Lide's body

485
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,350
home,

486
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,160
what time was it?

487
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,870
Around

488
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,740
11 p.m.

489
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,150
Everything fits.

490
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,300
Although Dugu Yang decided to die,

491
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,240
Lou Qingtai kept badgering him.

492
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,390
He was also worried that he had misjudged the truth

493
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,620
about the death of Lou Qingtai's father.

494
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,960
So he decided to carry the body home

495
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,520
and asked his mother Cao Hui to re-examine it.

496
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,960
So my son

497
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,350
said that night...

498
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,830
Mom, it's great to have you

499
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,910
re-examine it.

500
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,790
Mother.

501
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,630
I've been a coroner all my life.

502
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,390
I've never made a mistake.

503
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,150
I've lived up to

504
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,840
the skills you taught me.

505
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,070
Mother.

506
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,540
My greatest blessing

507
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,950
is that I can be your son.

508
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,320
Son,

509
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,480
did you kill yourself?

510
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,480
Yes.

511
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,950
Brother.

512
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,470
Before 1 a.m.,

513
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,150
I passed by the burial goods store again.

514
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,080
Seeing the candles were still lit,

515
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,450
I went

516
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,940
to talk with him.

517
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,670
You're here.

518
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,040
I've been waiting for you.

519
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,520
You don't look well.

520
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,740
Shouldn't you rest early?

521
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,800
Why don't you

522
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,720
go home and sleep tonight?

523
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,950
This place

524
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,400
has much Yin energy.

525
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,000
It's not this place that has much Yin energy.

526
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,780
It's me who has much Yin energy.

527
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,420
Uncle Zhong.

528
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,030
Could you do me a favor?

529
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,390
Coroner,

530
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,150
why are you suddenly so polite?

531
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,270
Tell me if you need anything.

532
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,430
Uncle Zhong.

533
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,270
Please accept

534
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,670
my bow.

535
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,130
Coroner, you...

536
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,450
He wanted to kill himself.

537
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,610
He asked me to put the sword

538
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,050
in the hand of the clay figurine,

539
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,190
wait outside the burial goods store,

540
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,920
and testify against the person

541
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,850
who came to the burial goods store

542
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,350
around 1 a.m.

543
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,390
I asked

544
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,830
why.

545
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,160
But...

546
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,230
Why?

547
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,630
Coroner.

548
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,710
Deaths of coroners

549
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,390
are insignificant.

550
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,990
Why?

551
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,850
Please agree to my request.

552
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,590
Brother.

553
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,970
Coroner has already died.

554
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,670
Even the best doctor couldn't save him.

555
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,010
I could only follow his instructions

556
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,960
and put the sword

557
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,580
in the hand of the clay figurine.

558
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,000
I know everything.

559
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,390
I thought it wasn't Dong Haogu

560
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,210
who caused Dugu Yang's death.

561
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,780
It's Niu Daming!

562
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,730
I had the same enemy as Coroner.

563
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,930
So I took the liberty of testifying against him.

564
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,070
Mother.

565
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,690
Niu Daming, according to the rules,

566
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,200
coroners don't go to execution grounds.

567
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,950
But when you're beheaded,

568
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,230
I, Cao Hui, the female coroner of Tang,

569
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,290
will personally perform an autopsy for you.

570
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,110
I want to see

571
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,720
if you have a heart.

572
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:18,910
Mother!

573
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,730
Mother!

574
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,110
-Don't panic.
-Mother.

575
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,100
Put her down.

576
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,990
I'll give her acupuncture.

577
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,630
Su Wuming.

578
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,910
Su Wuming!

579
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,790
Are you Coroner Dugu?

580
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,390
No.

581
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,710
I remember

582
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,910
you seemed to be dead.

583
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,790
Dugu.

584
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,260
Do you

585
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,790
have any regrets?

586
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,070
Dugu Yang!

587
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,050
It's been ten days.

588
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,030
Your wound is almost healed.

589
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,340
Why do you still have nightmares?

590
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,870
It's all because you played tough.

591
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,680
You went to the trial as soon as you woke up.

592
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,470
The poison took effect again.

593
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,400
You almost died.

594
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,550
You even stole

595
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,280
the limelight from General Lu.

596
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,270
No way!

597
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,270
Why were you avoiding me?

598
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,990
Do you think that I, a woman from Jianghu,

599
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,110
am not worthy of you?

600
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,940
No.

601
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,150
I'd never been hurt

602
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,070
so badly.

603
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,860
I already gave you half of my life.

604
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,460
Su Wuming.

605
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,310
As for the remaining half,

606
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,170
if you don't want it, just tell me.

607
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,200
No, I...

608
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,090
Did you chase me away because you knew

609
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,150
you would encounter assassins?

610
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,950
You didn't want me to follow you

611
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,710
because you didn't want to get me in trouble.

612
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,270
No...

613
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,310
I guess

614
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,840
that he should be awake.

615
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,590
Look. Look.

616
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,840
He woke up.

617
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,590
Fei. Xijun.

618
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,000
Didn't I tell you before...

619
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,910
She...

620
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,440
You said you didn't want to see Yingtao.

621
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,670
But we couldn't stop her.

622
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,270
Right.

623
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,310
You did something wrong to her.

624
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,480
Just apologize.

625
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,190
You're a man.

626
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,740
A man of integrity.

627
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,560
Is it so difficult

628
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,450
to say sorry?

629
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,780
Do you think you could chase Yingtao away again

630
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,230
if you refused to see her

631
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,070
this time?

632
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,110
It's like

633
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,870
you don't explain to Lu Lingfeng.

634
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,870
Doesn't he know

635
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,710
you're doing it for his own good?

636
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,150
Yingtao.

637
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,290
Please accept my bow.

638
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,880
Don't just bow.

639
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,150
Say what you should say.

640
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,510
I'm not good at saying nice words.

641
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,290
You're not good at saying nice words?

642
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,430
If you were not good at saying nice words,

643
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,670
we would all be mutes.

644
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,470
I seemed to dream

645
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,830
of Dugu Yang just now.

646
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,910
He asked me to go to the burial goods store

647
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,630
again

648
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,070
and find something for him.

649
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,670
Come back.

650
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,430
Is it money?

651
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,970
Lu Lingfeng has already found it.

652
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,570
You don't need to go.

653
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,030
[Highly Skilled]

654
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,310
We've reported the case

655
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,910
to the Yongzhou Government.

656
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,270
These five silver ingots

657
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,270
were obtained by Dugu Yang from his teaching.

658
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,790
Now, they're returned to his family.

659
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,760
That's all?

660
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,710
There were six silver ingots.

661
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,310
But Dugu Yang

662
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,210
gave one to Chunshan.

663
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,150
There're five silver ingots left.

664
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:51,710
They're all here.

665
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,970
I'm not talking about the silver ingots.

666
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,150
Didn't he leave me

667
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,310
anything else,

668
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,950
even if it's just a few words?

669
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,220
[A Letter of Divorce to Chuntiao by Dugu Yang]

670
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,470
A letter of divorce?

671
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,910
General Lu said

672
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,050
you can pretend it doesn't exist.

673
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,290
It's said that once people are married, their feelings will be deep.

674
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,970
I was so lucky to meet you.

675
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,360
Riding the same boat needs ten years of cultivation.

676
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,570
Sharing a bed and dreaming together need the fate of three lifetimes.

677
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,590
I wanted to hold your hands under flowers,

678
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,150
cook with you,

679
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,410
be a loving couple with you,

680
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,500
and make others envy us.

681
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,470
But I was born into a family of coroners.

682
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,580
I'm always looked down upon.

683
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,389
I'm not outgoing either.

684
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,340
It's hard for me to make you happy.

685
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,429
I have skills,

686
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,409
but I make clay figurines to make a living,

687
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,969
stop thieves from the tomb,

688
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,909
and am not valued by the world.

689
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,730
Seven years have passed, and discord has appeared.

690
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The resentment is hard to resolve and has become deep.

691
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,239
I wanted to change my temperament,

692
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,190
but it's hard.

693
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,409
I wanted to left my job as a coroner,

694
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,440
but I fell for it over time.

695
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,870
While I look old, you look beautiful.

696
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,550
I can't delay you

697
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,330
for this reason.

698
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,219
Today, I let you go, which makes both of us happy.

699
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,250
May you find a good husband.

700
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,270
Raise children with a smile on your face.

701
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,190
The family members will be happy, and I won't have regrets.

702
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,110
In order to leave a proof, I, Du Guyang, who's from Shiyang County of Yongzhou,

703
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,790
wrote this with respect.

704
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,310
Dugu Yang.

705
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,600
This isn't a letter of divorce.

706
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,910
Clearly, the whole letter is full of wistfulness.

707
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,910
It seems

708
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,840
that I, your wife,

709
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,630
am not that bad.

710
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,970
My Dugu was so good at writing.

711
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,090
If he hadn't born into a family of coroners,

712
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,870
he would have passed the imperial examination and become an imperial officer.

713
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,930
Forget about that.

714
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,730
Being an imperial officer

715
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,410
is a dream of all scholars,

716
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,170
but there has to be someone

717
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,110
being a coroner.

718
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,910
Mr. Su. Physician Fei.

719
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,430
Ladies.

720
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,630
You came just in time.

721
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,150
We have a big event today.

722
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,870
Please witness it.

723
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,950
I, Cao Hui, the female coroner of Tang,

724
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,950
will teach skills on behalf of my son Dugu Yang.

725
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,900
Who is kneeling?

726
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,590
The wife of Dugu Yang,

727
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,750
Chuntiao.

728
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,920
Do you volunteer to be a coroner?

729
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,270
Yes.

730
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,400
Once a coroner,

731
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,230
always a coroner.

732
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,640
Chuntiao, will you regret it?

733
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,110
No, I won't.

734
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,840
I should host it.

735
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,470
Chuntiao, bow to your teacher.

736
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,220
Bow.

737
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,850
The ceremony is completed.

738
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,390
Congratulations! The coroner family has a successor.

739
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:07,690
-Congratulations! The coroner family has a successor.
-Congratulations! The coroner family has a successor.

740
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,160
Aren't you cold?

741
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,030
I'm a bit cold.

742
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,900
But it's good to be cold.

743
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,190
Cold makes people sober

744
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,040
and makes me stop indulging

745
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,500
in the illusion of nightmares.

746
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,090
You actually dreamed of the case?

747
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,030
Are you shrewd

748
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,350
or deliberate?

749
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,670
What you said

750
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,680
are not good words.

751
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,870
Scold me if you want.

752
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,620
I just recovered.

753
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,110
I have nowhere to hide.

754
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,030
A notice has been issued in Shiyang.

755
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,660
The Su Wuming from Chang'an

756
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
has already died.

757
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,390
You're safe now.

758
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,990
But you haven't.

759
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,190
What do you mean?

760
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,360
The first poison dart

761
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,710
shot by the assassin that day

762
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,910
didn't seem

763
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,870
to be aimed at Dugu Xiashu.

764
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,990
Dugu Xiashu?

765
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,720
It's me.

766
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,950
I'm a magistrate in Shiyang.

767
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,410
-Welcome...
-Step aside!

768
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,270
When I was in the dark,

769
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,990
the assassins had already taken action.

770
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,250
Don't get me involved.

771
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,320
But you already said

772
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,530
that there were two groups of assassins.

773
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,670
Su Wuming.

774
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,520
Are you really not going to explain to me

775
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,390
what happened

776
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,230
in Chang'an?

777
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,620
I did it for my own future.

778
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,070
In order to get promoted and rich,

779
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,310
I went to the palace

780
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,880
and told the new emperor.

781
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,170
But in the end...

782
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,110
This is such an embarrassing thing.

783
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,550
What is there to explain?

784
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,840
If you don't want to explain it, forget it.

785
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,640
I'll see how long you can keep it.

786
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,720
We're departing tomorrow.

787
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,920
Would you like to go with us?

788
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,750
You've been in Shiyang for more than ten days.

789
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,890
Aren't you waiting for me to recover?

790
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,670
If I...

791
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,620
I'm staying here

792
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,830
not for you,

793
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,950
but to help Dugu Xiashu

794
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,630
bring peace back to Shiyang.

795
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,080
Are you going with us or not?

796
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,520
I'm not

797
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,300
an ungrateful person.

798
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,500
But I have to have an identity

799
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,690
if I go west with you.

800
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,190
How about being my personal secretary?

801
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,140
What's my monthly salary?

802
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,830
I'll give you one tenth of mine.

803
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,220
One tenth?

804
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,070
So little?

805
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,630
When you went south with me before,

806
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,190
I...

807
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,550
Did you ever pay me salary?

808
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,500
Didn't I?

809
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,000
Just one tenth.

810
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,660
We're departing tomorrow morning.

811
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,460
If you think it's little,

812
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,390
don't follow us.

813
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,340
Anyway, Yingtao told Xijun

814
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,270
that she'll go with us

815
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,970
to see the magnificent mountains and rivers

816
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,290
of Tang.

817
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,270
Lu Lingfeng.

818
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,000
Lu Lingfeng!

819
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,390
Let's talk about the salary.

820
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,590
Raise it a bit.

821
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,910
Dugu.

822
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,900
From now on,

823
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,020
everything will depend on you.

824
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,270
Remember,

825
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,790
the point of being an official

826
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,670
is to do more practical things for people.

827
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,790
In doing so,

828
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,910
you can sleep well, eat well,

829
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,990
and feel at ease.

830
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,890
I was educated.

831
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,110
By the way,

832
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,510
is

833
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,720
the Dugu Xin Jet Tumbled Stone Multifaceted Seal

834
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,390
a legend

835
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,930
or a real thing?

836
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,310
You have to

837
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,710
solve this mystery.

838
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,790
Okay.

839
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,710
I'll keep that in mind

840
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,320
until I find the answer.

841
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,630
Please wait.

842
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,720
Take the naan I made

843
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,920
to eat on the way.

844
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,110
Mr. Ma, thank you.

845
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,010
General Lu.

846
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,200
You cleared my name.

847
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,310
You're my savior.

848
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,910
Please accept my bow.

849
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,180
Although there is no chicken,

850
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,710
I have to thank you.

851
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,320
Alright.

852
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,750
It's time to say goodbye.

853
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,110
Guys.

854
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,270
Stay.

855
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,190
Goodbye.

856
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,790
Mr. Su.

857
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,090
General Lu.

858
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,290
Physician Fei.

859
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,540
Miss Xijun.

860
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,910
Heroine Yingtao.

861
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,840
If you have friends who know your heart,

862
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,470
Distance cannot keep you apart.

863
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,330
At crossroads where we bid adieu,

864
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,940
Do not shed tears as women do!

865
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,540
With the lines of Wang Zi'an,

866
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm sending you off.

867
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,750
I found the right person.

868
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,890
Brother, what do you mean?

869
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,040
If you think this wood carving

870
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,030
is good,

871
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,080
please cherish it

872
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,990
and never give it up.

873
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,670
It'd be better

874
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,030
to pass it down.

875
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,150
Brother!

876
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,210
Why did Brother come to me

877
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,500
in my dream?

878
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,550
This...

879
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,620
This is Brother's family heirloom.

880
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,440
Please take it back and keep it.

881
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,630
There really is such a seal.

882
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:14,870
Let me see.

883
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,460
What a treasure.

884
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,480
What do you mean?

885
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,300
He entrusted this seal to you.

886
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,710
It's yours.

887
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:35,360
No.

888
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,270
You must keep it for him.

889
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,030
This isn't just a treasure.

890
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,400
This is the life of Dugu Yang

891
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,270
and the Dugu family.

892
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,540
Physician Fei has treated Mother for days.

893
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,190
My mother

894
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,480
has almost recovered.

895
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:51,190
She told me that many years ago,

896
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,450
Dugu Yang's father

897
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,310
would rather marry into a coroner family

898
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,470
than sell this seal.

899
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,520
He only had one condition.

900
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,750
If he had descendants, their surname should be Dugu.

901
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,470
He entrusted this seal to you.

902
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:05,950
It must be because your surname is also Dugu.

903
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,270
Please cherish this seal

904
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:09,960
and pass it down

905
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,790
from generation to generation.

906
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,590
Please.

907
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,370
I'll keep that in mind.

908
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,200
This seal

909
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,490
is the treasure of our country.

910
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,930
Thousands of years later,

911
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,510
it'll surely shine brightly

912
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,710
and comfort Brother.

913
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:37,960
By the way,

914
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,310
how interesting it is.

915
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,390
Yesterday, Dugu Yang came to me in my dream

916
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,350
and asked me to invite you to the house for some soup noodles.

917
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,400
If you want to eat,

918
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,270
come anytime.

919
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,390
Thank you.
