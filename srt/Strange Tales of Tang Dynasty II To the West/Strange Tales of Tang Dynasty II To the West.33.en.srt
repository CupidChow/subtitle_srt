00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,750
What Fang Jiong said

5
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,120
matches what Lin Bei

6
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,229
said.

7
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,310
It's not just a match;

8
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,590
it’s a

9
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,710
perfect match.

10
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,550
Su Wuming,

11
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,600
what do you mean by that?

12
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,150
Nothing.

13
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,300
Now we only have

14
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,630
one suspect left.

15
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,630
Yes.

16
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,670
That ugly woman.

17
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,690
As soon as Chu Bin left,

18
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,410
she returned to the Biluo Inn.

19
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,210
Currently,

20
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,390
she is the prime suspect in the murder.

21
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,110
I plan to put up Xijun's painting

22
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,240
at the night market,

23
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,390
and offer a substantial reward

24
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,190
for any leads.

25
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,350
There’s no need to rush.

26
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,750
You can do it tomorrow morning.

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,610
Why wait until tomorrow morning?

28
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,870
I'll post it tonight.

29
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,329
I’ll personally post it at the night market.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,160
Everyone!

31
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,600
Come and take a look!

32
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,350
Come.

33
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,790
Come. Let's take a look.

34
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,750
We are currently tracking down a major suspect,

35
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,680
with unknown name and background,

36
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,590
and appearance as shown in the picture.

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,670
Anyone with information

38
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,790
or knowledge of her whereabouts

39
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,270
should report to the government office immediately.

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,390
There will be a substantial reward.

41
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,650
A substantial reward?

42
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,450
Who is this?

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,400
I don't know.

44
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,550
No.

45
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,310
Who can possibly recognize this person?

46
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,030
Xijun and the others

47
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,030
must have already found a place

48
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,070
to feast and drink.

49
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,600
Let's go.

50
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,430
Hey, everyone.

51
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,590
Make way.

52
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,430
Why did he tear it down?

53
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:10,870
Yeah.

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,490
Let's not gather here.

55
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,820
He just tore it down like that?

56
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,350
What's wrong with this guy?

57
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,610
What are you doing?

58
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,290
Post it tomorrow morning.

59
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,250
State your reason.

60
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,510
I haven't thought of one yet.

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,390
If I had a reason,

62
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,350
do you think I would keep it to myself?

63
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,210
How about this?

64
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,510
Let's go eat first

65
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,630
and let me think it over.

66
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,000
How is it?

67
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,990
Are you satisfied with this place?

68
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,430
What’s there to be dissatisfied with?

69
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,270
It's the best restaurant in Yunding,

70
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,600
and it's a private room.

71
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,560
Lu Lingfeng,

72
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,990
you’re the one treating us to a meal,

73
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,120
but Yingtao is the one who arranged everything for you.

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,270
She put in a lot of effort to make sure you,

75
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,130
as the sheriff,

76
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,600
don’t lose face.

77
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,110
You should thank her.

78
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,080
Thank you, Heroine Chu.

79
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,630
Sheriff Lu, you’re too kind.

80
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,690
Take the main seat.

81
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,230
With Physician Fed here,

82
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,310
I dare not take the main seat.

83
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,430
Cut it out.

84
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,190
You’re the host.

85
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,660
Of course you should take the main seat.

86
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,540
Su Wuming,

87
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,190
are you unhappy because we didn’t

88
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,270
let you take the main seat?

89
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,990
Am I that petty?

90
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,590
Lu Lingfeng is treating us to a meal.

91
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,470
You should be delighted.

92
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,030
I want to be delighted,

93
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,010
but with the case unresolved,

94
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,909
I just can't feel happy.

95
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,450
Where is Xijun?

96
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,030
Why isn't she here?

97
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,070
She has arrived

98
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,470
but insisted on waiting for you to arrive first

99
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,680
before coming in.

100
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,909
Why is that?

101
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,720
Lu Lingfeng,

102
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,040
I really like this outfit.

103
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,990
Thank you.

104
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,390
I'm glad to hear that.

105
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,120
Then come and take a seat.

106
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,270
Was this outfit

107
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,110
a gift from Lu Lingfeng?

108
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,550
Yes.

109
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,030
Lu Lingfeng had someone make it

110
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,630
without knowing my size.

111
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,240
Weren't you afraid that it might not fit

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,570
and end up being wasted?

113
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,350
I’m just surprised

114
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,909
that it fits Xijun

115
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,950
perfectly.

116
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,170
Sheriff Lu,

117
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,710
it seems you know Xijun

118
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,240
very well.

119
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,710
Yingtao!

120
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,790
You're implying something here!

121
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,350
Was it made at Tianyi Fabric Shop?

122
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,680
Yes.

123
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,430
The tailor delivered it to the residence

124
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,870
and said that if it didn’t fit,

125
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,630
they could make alterations.

126
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,840
When was it delivered?

127
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,480
Just now,

128
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,540
at dusk.

129
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,440
Lu Lingfeng,

130
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,150
did you go to Tianyi Fabric Shop

131
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,360
yesterday at dusk?

132
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,630
Yes.

133
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,920
Yingtao.

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
You know

135
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,500
how to do needlework, right?

136
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,760
How long would it take to make a piece of clothing like this?

137
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,350
If I were to do it,

138
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,310
I wouldn’t finish it in a year.

139
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,110
Let alone her,

140
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,310
even a good tailor

141
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,340
would need 2 or 3 days.

142
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,630
It was ordered yesterday

143
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,630
and delivered today?

144
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,659
I remember the tailor

145
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,210
is named Ding Dade.

146
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,590
Maybe he’s skilled and works fast,

147
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,420
or perhaps

148
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,550
he rushed after finding out

149
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,070
I’m the sheriff.

150
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,730
Even with rushing,

151
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,600
from yesterday dusk to today dusk

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,920
was only 12 hours.

153
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,270
So, this tailor

154
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,590
must have stayed up all night.

155
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,880
The owner of the fabric shop died,

156
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,790
but he kept

157
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,500
working on this outfit.

158
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,430
This is suspicious.

159
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,750
Xijun,

160
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,860
come with me to Tianyi Fabric Shop.

161
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,820
I won’t be investigating in my capacity as sheriff.

162
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,590
We’ll say you really like the outfit

163
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,120
and that we’re there to thank him personally.

164
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,350
You...

165
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,060
Fed,

166
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,070
I want to examine the body again.

167
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,460
Can you assist me?

168
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,730
Come on!

169
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,350
Are we going to have this meal or not?

170
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,620
The dishes have already been served.

171
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,270
Exactly.

172
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,820
Calm down.

173
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,830
How about this?

174
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,760
Take them back as a midnight snack.

175
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,350
Fed, let's go.

176
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,630
What?

177
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,290
Well...

178
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,570
Pack them up for me.

179
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,150
I...

180
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,210
Well...

181
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,260
How do you want me to assist you?

182
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,680
If we can't determine the cause of death today,

183
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,920
we'll have to proceed with an autopsy.

184
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,170
At that point, I'll have many questions

185
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,220
to ask you.

186
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,900
Why do I feel like

187
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,620
you’re a bit like my senior,

188
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
Old Weirdo Meng?

189
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,030
I don't want it to come to that either.

190
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,130
After all, performing an autopsy

191
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,950
is quite frightening.

[Tianyi Fabric Shop]

193

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,760
you're here.

195
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,530
Is there something about the outfit

196
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,710
that doesn’t fit well?

197
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,390
I think the outfit is fine.

198
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,470
It's not because of Dade's excellent craftsmanship,

199
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,270
but because your natural beauty

200
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,800
makes the outfit look good.

201
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,160
You're a sweet talker.

202
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,510
What's your name?

203
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,680
My name is Changle.

204
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,870
Madam gave me this name

205
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,070
with the hope that I would be happy every day.

206
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,670
The outfit is very well made.

207
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,410
Ms. Pei likes it very much.

208
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,950
We came to express

209
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,910
our gratitude to the tailor.

210
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,350
You came in person

211
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,280
to thank me?

212
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,730
You really flatter me.

213
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,140
It’s not just about thanking you;

214
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,540
we also want to invite you

215
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,640
to have a drink at the night market.

216
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,600
Well...

217
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,860
that's not necessary.

218
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,830
Ms. Pei and I

219
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,420
are currently choosing a date

220
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,670
for our wedding.

221
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,400
For the wedding attire,

222
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,000
we would like you to make it.

223
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,660
According to Chang’an customs,

224
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,670
before making it,

225
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,780
we must invite the tailor to a meal.

226
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,010
What’s the matter,

227
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,630
Dade?

228
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,070
Are you refusing to honor me?

229
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,780
To be able to make the wedding attire for the sheriff

230
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,390
and Ms. Pei

231
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,070
is a great honor for me.

232
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,190
However,

233
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,510
I must consult with Madam

234
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,390
and seek her permission first.

235
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,220
Of course.

236
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,550
Go ahead.

237
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,310
I'll wait for you.

238
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,880
What's this?

239
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,350
It looks like lime.

240
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,630
Let me see.

241
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,190
It does look like lime.

242
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,290
I smelled his mouth earlier

243
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,710
and detected a faint lime scent.

244
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,360
I thought I was mistaken.

245
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,200
I can verify that.

246
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,590
It is lime.

247
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,560
The scent is faint,

248
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,400
but it is undoubtedly lime.

249
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,790
Could it be that Li Yun

250
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,070
died from this?

251
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,190
Dade.

252
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,750
A toast to you.

253
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,350
I...

254
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,350
I don't drink.

255
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,830
Master said

256
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,670
drinking leads to hands shaking, which would

257
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,980
make me unable to work as a tailor anymore.

258
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,710
Please forgive me, Sheriff Lu.

259
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,150
That's a good excuse

260
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,350
not to drink.

261
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,110
Dade,

262
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,910
let me pour you some water.

263
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,390
Tell us,

264
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,910
why are you so skilled in tailoring?

265
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,510
I started as an errand boy in the fabric shop when I was 7.

266
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,590
I began learning the trade from the old master at ten,

267
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,550
but I wasn't very good at it because I'm not smart enough.

268
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,370
Unlike Master,

269
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,830
who became the best tailor in Yunding

270
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,690
in just 2 years.

271
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,270
You mean Li Yun?

272
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:18,990
Yes.

273
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,510
Back then,

274
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,430
he was learning from the old master too.

275
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,350
In just two years,

276
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,550
the old master said he had surpassed him.

277
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,150
Of course,

278
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,790
all the customers who come to Shen's Fabric Shop

279
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,590
to have their clothes made

280
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,650
say the same thing.

281
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,070
Master was indeed

282
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,400
a prodigy in this trade.

283
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,770
I’m still not even close to his level.

284
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,110
Shen's Fabric Shop?

285
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,990
Tianyi Fabric Shop

286
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,550
is the name Master changed to

287
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,410
after the old master passed away.

288
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,390
Here.

289
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,350
Drink water instead of wine.

290
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,750
Ms. Pei and I toast to you.

291
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,450
Thank you, Sheriff Lu.

292
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,890
Thank you, Ms. Pei.

293
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,790
You're not drinking, but your hands are still shaking.

294
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,910
I don't think

295
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,790
you can make a living as a tailor.

296
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,650
I really am a disappointment.

297
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,630
As a servant,

298
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,790
I never dreamed

299
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,430
I would drink with an official.

300
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,760
I can hardly believe it,

301
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,800
which is why my hands were shaking.

302
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,350
Look,

303
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm fine now.

304
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,510
Sit.

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,880
You look tired.

306
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,310
You must not have slept last night.

307
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,670
You spent a whole day and night

308
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,670
working on this outfit, didn’t you?

309
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:24,870
Yes.

310
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,090
Why didn't you sleep?

311
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,630
I didn’t say I needed it urgently

312
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,320
when I went to the fabric store.

313
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,830
I...

314
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,510
I...

315
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,310
Your master passed away suddenly,

316
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,760
and the cause of death is unclear.

317
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,600
Weren't you supposed to

318
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,570
do something within your capacity

319
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,570
to help the madam,

320
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,350
such as preparing the coffin

321
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,270
and handling the funeral arrangements?

322
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,030
I... I...

323
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,830
I'm not just an official,

324
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,680
but an official in charge of catching criminals.

325
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,160
Dade,

326
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
your master’s death is suspicious.

327
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,210
If you have any clues,

328
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,950
you should report them to Sheriff Lu.

329
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,430
Okay.

330
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,190
Okay.

331
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,680
There are no clues.

332
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,240
Here.

333
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,070
A toast to you.

334
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,470
Dade,

335
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,150
was your master good to you?

336
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,470
Yes.

337
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,910
I was a slow learner.

338
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,510
I didn’t learn the craft well

339
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,430
from the old master.

340
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,750
Ever since Li Yun became the master,

341
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,360
I’ve been

342
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,660
learning it quickly from him.

343
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,910
It’s all thanks to him

344
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,910
that I have my skills today.

345
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,430
Did Li Yun meet Shen Ping

346
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,560
when he was learning

347
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,110
the craft at Shen's Fabric Shop?

348
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,790
Yes.

349
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,750
Did they fall in love at first sight

350
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,870
and become mutually affectionate,

351
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,020
or did Li Yun pursue Shen Ping

352
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,360
and win her heart through his efforts?

353
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,230
Well...

354
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,930
How should I put it?

355
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,390
Just tell the truth.

356
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,150
It was our young lady,

357
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,750
now the madam,

358
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,030
who courted

359
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,480
and pursued Master.

360
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,960
Shen Ping actively courted

361
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,050
and pursued Li Yun?

362
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,630
Exactly.

363
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,680
Are you sure?

364
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,310
Even though I was young at the time,

365
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:11,830
I could

366
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
still tell.

367
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,260
Otherwise, Madam wouldn’t have refused

368
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,460
the proposal from Fang Jiong's family.

369
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,050
Fang Jiong has proposed to Shen Ping?

370
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,460
Well...

371
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,550
maybe not.

372
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,150

to have Sheriff Lu visit

379
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,270
so late at night.

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,110
Yes.

386
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,530
Please.

387
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,590
Even the best wine

388
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,670
can be harmful if you drink too much.

389
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,900
Since you have guests,

390
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,030
I’ll excuse myself.

391
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,490
Sheriff Lu, you didn’t come to drink?

392
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,920
I made an invitation

393
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,470
at the government office today,

394
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,069
so I thought you were coming in response to it.

395
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,829
I came to ask

396
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,060
why you didn’t mention

397
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,250
your proposal to Shen Ping today.

398
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,109
Sheriff Lu,

399
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,030
you didn't ask me either.

400
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,069
If you had,

401
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,990
I would have certainly told you.

402
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,910
That was more than 10 years ago.

403
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,220
Now, Shen Ping is the wife

404
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,609
of my good friend

405
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,650
and has just lost her husband.

406
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,350
It would have been inappropriate to bring up

407
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,110
such an old story for no reason, wouldn’t it?

408
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,390
If you’re not hungry,

409
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,150
I’ll start eating first.

410
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,350
An empty stomach

411
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,230
makes it hard for me to sleep.

412
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,790
For this case,

413
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,300
the only lead I can think of

414
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,790
is to find that ugly woman.

415
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,060
However, it’s probably a dead end.

416
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,510
Just ignore that suggestion.

417
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,240
I'll eat too.

418
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,440
Fang Jiong responded calmly,

419
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,630
and there were no noticeable flaws in what he said.

420
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,510
It’s just that

421
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,910
it looked like he had anticipated

422
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,040
that Lu Lingfeng would come to see him.

423
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,510
Su Wuming,

424
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,550
can the portrait of that ugly woman

425
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,680
be posted tomorrow?

426
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:46,790
No.

427
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,150
Tomorrow morning, we need to first investigate

428
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,410
all the places in the city that sell lime.

429
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,700
-Lime?
-Lime?

430
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,690
Sheriff Lu,

431
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,310
there are four stores in the city

432
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,990
that sell lime.

433
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,120
The owners have all been brought here.

434
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,990
Sheriff Lu!

435
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,310
We meet again.

436
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,370
We really seem to be quite fated.

437
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,110
Mudan?

438
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,470
So,

439
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,920
you also sell lime?

440
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,990
If I don’t sell lime,

441
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,030
how could I know

442
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,190
Heitou, the kiln worker?

443
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,870
Everyone,

444
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,070
I called you here because I have something to ask.

445
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,490
Have there been any unusual people

446
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,730
buying lime recently?

447
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,350
Unusual people? Well...

448
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,480
My customers are all regulars.

449
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,920
No.

450
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,330
Unusual?

451
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,110
No.

452
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,990
No.

453
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,390
Have any women bought lime?

454
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,430
Yes.

455
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,060
Sheriff Lu,

456
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,810
you didn’t go through all this

457
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,550
just to target me,

458
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,640
did you?

459
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,950
The other three can leave now.

460
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,860
You three

461
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:57,880
can go now.

462
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,310
Sheriff Lu,

463
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,500
your words yesterday

464
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,910
made things clear to me.

465
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,110
With the prosperity of Yunding

466
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,540
and the many buildings being constructed,

467
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,070
lime is needed everywhere.

468
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,590
From now on,

469
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,030
I will focus on running a good business

470
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,030
and saving money.

471
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,430
I’ll no longer engage in

472
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,660
disreputable activities

473
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,720
and will wait for a good match to come.

474
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,110
I'm glad to hear that.

475
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,630
Tell me about the woman who bought the lime.

476
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,990
That woman!

477
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,820
That woman is really ugly.

478
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,670
An ugly woman?

479
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,630
At the time, I asked her

480
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,920
whether she was buying lime

481
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,870
for filling gaps to prevent water leakage,

482
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,110
painting walls,

483
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,750
dyeing, or papermaking.

484
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,550
She said

485
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,470
she was buying lime to make a grave.

486
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,590
How ominous!

487
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,860
Su Wuming,

488
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,510
go get that portrait

489
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,060
and have Mudan identify it.

490
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,000
Sheriff Lu, please forgive me.

491
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,710
I…

492
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,220
I lost the portrait.

493
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,310
How could you…

494
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,430
Please don't be angry.

495
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,550
Since Mudan

496
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,980
has seen that ugly woman,

497
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,410
it shouldn’t be difficult

498
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,330
to ask Xijun to come over

499
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,860
and draw another portrait.

500
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,040
You, as the secretary,

501
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,210
are very disappointing.

502
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:18,790
Yes.

503
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,770
Hurry up and invite Ms. Pei here.

504
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,590
Mudan,

505
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,590
I'm sorry.

506
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,990
It may take a while.

507
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,990
Please come to the Western Office for some tea.

508
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,030
Sheriff Lu, there's no need to be so polite.

509
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,990
I actually enjoy listening to you talk.

510
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,590
I don’t mind if it takes time.

511
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,150
Xijun,

512
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,190
let me remind you again.

513
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,070
Be sure to forget the previous portrait.

514
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,950
Just paint according to Mudan's description.

515
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,530
Ask for more details about this woman's appearance;

516
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,320
the more detailed, the better.

517
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,280
Understood.

518
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,420
[Yunding County Government Office]

519
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,870
Though they both said she’s ugly,

520
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,630
the descriptions from Ms. Yin and Mudan

521
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,670
were completely different.

522
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,790
The head shape, hairstyle,

523
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,230
and clothing color are all different.

524
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,550
They should be two different people.

525
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,210
Sheriff Lu.

526
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,890
Fang Jiong has been brought here.

527
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,040
Let's go.

528
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,710
Aren't you going?

529
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,160
I want to take Xijun

530
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,320
to Anyuan Inn again

531
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,110
and have her draw the ugly woman again

532
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,910
based on Lin Bei's description.

533
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,990
After all, as Ms. Yin said,

534
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,030
they've met before.

535
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,130
Fang Jiong,

536
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,230
I invited you here today

537
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,660
to listen to

538
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
your past with Li Yun.

539
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,550
The past is hard to revisit.

540
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,430
Where should I start?

541
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,770
Anywhere you like.

542
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,090
I have time

543
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,190
and am willing to listen to your story.

544
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,540
As I mentioned before,

545
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,360
Li Yun and I were classmates

546
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,460
and once traveled to Chang'an together.

547
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,470
Later, I returned to Yunding for business,

548
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,730
and he went to Luoyang.

549
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,110
Two years later, he returned to Yunding

550
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,150
with Chu Bin.

551
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,480
At that time,

552
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,910
I was really envious of them.

553
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,300
At that time, how were things between you and Shen Ping?

554
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,430
Actually, you can say Shen Ping and I

555
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,090
were childhood sweethearts.

556
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,190
But I was a bit of a free spirit

557
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,190
and was never in a hurry to talk about marriage.

558
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,600
Childhood sweethearts?

559
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,450
Could it be that it was you who introduced Li Yun

560
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,630
to Shen's Fabric Shop for his apprenticeship?

561
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,650
Indeed.

562
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,820
Li Yun's parents passed away early

563
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,660
and didn't leave him much.

564
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,630
When he first returned to Yunding,

565
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,990
he planned to rely on Chu Bin

566
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,850
to make a living by copying books.

567
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,020
But he didn't expect

568
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,400
that there weren't many people who read books in Yunding.

569
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,010
The bookstore business is sluggish.

570
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,140
So there wasn't much work for a scribe.

571
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,880
Therefore, Li Yun came to me,

572
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,190
hoping I could help him find a job.

573
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,150
I said, "Your hands are so deft

574
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,750
that you can even embroider.

575
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,390
How about

576
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,030
learning tailoring

577
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,800
from my future father-in-law?"

578
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,790
To be honest,

579
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,110
Uncle Shen originally

580
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,720
wanted me to learn from him

581
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,430
and take over

582
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,960
the fabric shop business

583
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,190
as Shen Ping's dowry.

584
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,680
Unfortunately,

585
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,070
my ambitions lay elsewhere

586
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,390
and let him down.

587
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,060
Fang,

588
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,670
do you regret it?

589
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,240
Regret what?

590
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,930
If you hadn't recommended Li Yun,

591
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,950
Shen Ping

592
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,720
might have already become Mrs. Fang, right?

593
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,270
Sheriff Lu,

594
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,390
you're not going to ask

595
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,640
if I had been

596
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,830
holding a grudge

597
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,310
and killed Li Yun, are you?

598
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,910
What if I really ask that?

599
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,840
Rumor has it that you, Lu Lingfeng,

600
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,120
are a disciple of Detective Di,

601
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,160
unmatched in martial arts,

602
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,440
and a genius in solving cases.

603
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,470
Turns out, it’s just an empty reputation.

604
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,830
With such limited ability,

605
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,390
you replaced Sheriff Sima, who was adept

606
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,310
with both the pen and the sword.

607
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,750
And Sheriff Sima,

608
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,750
who brought so much good to the people,

609
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,610
died for you, a worthless person.

610
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,570
It's truly a tragedy for Yunding

611
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,190
and the Tang Dynasty.

612
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,170
Fang Jiong!

613
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,260
Lu Lingfeng!

614
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,390
Was it too much to call you worthless?

615
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,590
What evidence do you have to suspect me?

616
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,870
Li Yun died the night before last.

617
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,230
That night, I was hosting a banquet at my home.

618
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,910
Over ten friends who were present

619
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,840
can all testify.

620
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,790
We drank and sang

621
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,790
all night long.

622
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,920
I never said

623
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,240
it was you who killed Li Yun.

624
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,870
Fine.

625
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,020
I'll take my leave!

626
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,060
Stop!

627
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,510
You detained me in the government office

628
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,230
without any evidence.

629
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,540
Aren't you afraid that the people of Yunding

630
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,940
will laugh at you when they hear about this?

631
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,800
[Anyuan Inn]

632
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,230
I have seen such a woman,

633
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,160
but only once.

634
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,420
I can't clearly remember

635
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,880
her appearance.

636
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,670
It's alright.

637
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,790
Just describe as much as you can recall.

638
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,870
Miss Xijun here

639
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,540
is an excellent painter.

640
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,060
I'm sure you two can draw it.

641
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,110
This is a matter related to a murder case,

642
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,270
so please cooperate with us.

643
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,430
Alright then.

644
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,590
I only remember

645
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,300
that she wasn’t beautiful.

646
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,760
You could even say she was ugly.

647
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,090
But what was the shape of her face?

648
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,390
Did she have any distinguishing features on her face,

649
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,350
like moles

650
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,530
or tattoos?

651
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,990
What about her height and weight

652
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,990
compared to mine?

653
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,070
Did she have any asymmetry in her shoulders,

654
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,800
a hunchback,

655
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,670
a limp,

656
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,950
or any other disabilities?

657
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,190
Ms. Yin,

658
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,110
Mudan,

659
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,790
and Lin Bei,

660
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,710
all three of them have only one thing in common

661
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,710
in their impressions of this woman:

662
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,710
she's ugly.

663
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,550
However,

664
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,350
according to their detailed descriptions,

665
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,210
it's clearly not the same person.

666
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,830
Perhaps

667
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,730
they are describing three different women.

668
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,110
Or...

669
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,500
Or what?

670
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,440
Or it's a woman

671
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,630
who can freely change her hairstyle,

672
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,570
clothes, and even her appearance.

673
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,640
Isn't that a ghost from the legends?

674
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,340
Exactly.

675
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,630
Su Wuming,

676
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,110
what were the words you said before?

677
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,110
There are neither gods nor ghosts

678
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,990
in this world,

679
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,480
only people pretending to be them.

680
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,990
But this time,

681
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,990
who is the real murderer?

682
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,470
Who said the person in the painting

683
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,400
is the murderer?

684
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,170
If you say it’s a ghost,

685
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,730
I won’t believe it.

686
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,750
I will.

687
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,710
It is said that

688
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,110
Li Yun once wronged

689
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,700
a girl named Chu Bin.

690
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,830
Although she’s dead,

691
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,350
her soul remains.

692
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,180
With Lin Bei’s guidance,

693
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,270
she returned to Yunding

694
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,820
to kill for revenge.

695
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,790
Being a ghost,

696
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,030
she appears differently

697
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,790
to different people,

698
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,830
which is why we have three different portraits.

699
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,430
Su Wuming,

700
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,160
what nonsense are you talking about?

701
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,470
If what I just said

702
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,870
appeared in a book of strange tales,

703
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,690
wouldn’t it be very intriguing?

704
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,950
Yes.

705
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,910
But this case is indeed bizarre.

706
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,950
I almost started

707
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,610
to believe what you just said.

708
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,870
Actually, there’s another possibility:

709
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,830
this person

710
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,110
doesn’t exist at all.

711
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,920
Brother, are you saying

712
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,070
that all three of them lied?

713
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,110
And

714
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,240
they conspired together.

715
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,430
This is just my speculation.

716
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,410
Sheriff Lu,

717
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,760
today is Cold Food Festival,

718
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,750
which is also Chu Bin's death anniversary.

719
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,390
I want to

720
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,350
open the coffin and conduct a postmortem of the body.

721
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,610
Chu Bin was from Dongdu

722
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,350
and died here in Yunding.

723
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,530
Opening her coffin

724
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,750
doesn’t require consent from her family.

725
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,710
So,

726
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,030
I need the sheriff's approval.

727
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,560
I know what you suspect,

728
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,510
but this matter is of great importance.

729
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,310
We need Magistrate Huangfu's consent to proceed.

730
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,990
Let me think about it.

731
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,310
What I mean is,

732
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,510
opening the coffin

733
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,390
is likely to cause panic.

734
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,730
We should try not to...

735
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,660
If you don't allow it,

736
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,790
then the murderer can only be a ghost.

737
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,620
If ghosts

738
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,110
are killing people in Yunding,

739
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,030
the people will be even more frightened, won't they?

740
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,630
Mr. Su, you made a good point.

741
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,090
So, Sheriff Lu, what is your opinion?

742
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,750
Chu Bin has no family or friends in Yunding.

743
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,970
As long as the magistrate approves,

744
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,830
we can conduct

745
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,980
the coffin opening in secret.

746
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,560
That could work.

747
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,790
To catch the murderer

748
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,420
and uncover the truth,

749
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
a postmortem

750
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,910
is indeed necessary.

751
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,760
-Well then,
-Well then,

752
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,990
-thank you, Magistrate.
-thank you, Magistrate.

753
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,250
Carry it out secretly.

754
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,530
Carry it out secretly.

755
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Chu Bin has been buried for 10 years.

756
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,630
Can a postmortem

757
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,990
determine how she died

758
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,830
back then?

759
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,250
Even if we find out the cause of death,

760
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,580
what does it have to do with Li Yun's death?

761
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,230
I really can't figure it out.

762
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,510
I think I have a vague idea

763
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,910
of Brother's intention.

764
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,230
Lu Lingfeng's look

765
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,890
also gave something away.

766
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,110
They're asking for our help

767
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,710
but not telling us the whole truth.

768
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,840
Isn't this bullying me for being dumb?

769
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,360
Is that Chu Bin's grave?

770
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,550
Based on the location Li Men

771
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,550
and previous neighbors mentioned,

772
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,400
it should be this grave.

773
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,670
Why is this woman here to pay respects at the grave?

774
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,270
Yeah.

775
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,420
I have already sent people to guard Anyuan Inn

776
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,220
to prevent Lin Bei from leaving.

777
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,720
Could she possibly be able to

778
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,250
fly or burrow underground?

779
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,790
Carrying a package and a long sword,

780
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,340
[Tomb of Chu Bin]

781
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,750
she's clearly trying to flee Yunding.

782
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,960
Who are you guys?

783
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,510
Who are you?

784
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,670
I'm the sister of Chu Bin,

785
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,040
the owner of this grave,

786
00:31:59,150 --> 00:31:59,910
Chu Jia.

787
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,760
You're here for Li Yun, aren't you?

788
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,070
We are capturing

789
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,630
the murderer of Li Yun.

790
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,900
Are you confessing to the crime?

791
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,330
[Chu Jia, Sister of Chu Bin]

792
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,350
Li Yun is dead?

793
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,790
How is that possible?

794
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,590
I just arrived in Yunding today.

795
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,630
Who else

796
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,000
would avenge my sister?

797
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,510
Don't waste your breath on her.

798
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,640
Arrest her and interrogate her later.

799
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,570
Sheriff Lu,

800
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,960
leave her to me.

801
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,180
Impressive swordsmanship.

802
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,440
You're not bad either.

803
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,830
Li Yun must have spared no expense.

804
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,160
He hired so many experts

805
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,930
and even people from the county office

806
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,190
to be his accomplices.

807
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,470
But I, Chu Jia,

808
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,770
am no longer the weak girl I used to be.

809
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,520
Come on then.

810
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,820
Stop fighting.

811
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,440
Heroines,

812
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,590
stop fighting!

813
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,630
Today is Chu Bin's death anniversary.

814
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,670
Fighting in front of her grave

815
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,600
is disrespectful to the deceased.

816
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,650
Who are you people?

817
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,730
What are you doing here?

818
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,720
Lu Lingfeng,

819
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,280
it's your turn to speak.

820
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,350
I'm Lu Lingfeng, the sheriff of Yunding County.

821
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,150
I'm here today

822
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,030
under the order to open the coffin.

823
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,710
What?

824
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,340
You're so vicious.

825
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,900
I'll kill you!

826
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,630
Are you really Chu Bin's sister?

827
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,590
Of course I am.

828
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,790
Otherwise, why would I travel such a long distance

829
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,750
to Yunding

830
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,110
to avenge my sister?

831
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:33,250

Congratulations.

00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,429
Congratulations.

835
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,949
Today, my shop is officially renamed.

836
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,219
I wish to make fairy-like beautiful clothes

Bravo!

Bravo!

Li Yun,

841
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,429
how did my sister die?

842
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,190
Didn't I already tell you?

843
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,310
Heart attack.

844
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,490
But she never had that condition.

845
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,370
Who is born with a disease?

846
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,590
Aren't they all acquired later?

847
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,350
Was she treated

848
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,790
with medication and care?

849
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,320
Of course, she was treated.

850
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,690
But from the onset of the illness to her death,

851
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,220
it was only about two hours.

852
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,550
Chu Jia,

853
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,150
you just arrived in Yunding

854
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,630
and are grieving from the bad news.

855
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,430
I understand.

856
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,150
I didn't take good care of Chu Bin.

857
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,610
You can slap me if you want.

858
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,670
But today is a joyous day

859
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,510
for my family.

860
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,640
You saw it yourself.

861
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,070
So I ask you to leave as soon as you're done.

862
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,600
Do you have any conscience?

863
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,830
It's not like you don't know

864
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,790
my home address.

865
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,730
If Chu Bin really died from an illness,

866
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,610
why didn't you write to inform me?

867
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,410
I did...

868
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,630
I did write it.

869
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,790
How can you blame me for not receiving the letter?

870
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,470
Back then,

871
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,380
you were just

872
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,480
a little clerk at a pharmacy

873
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,880
with impure intentions.

874
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,790
I was very reluctant

875
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,750
to let my sister come to Yunding with you.

876
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,500
I never expected

877
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,670
you would really cause her death!

878
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,710
Nonsense! Servants!

879
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,130
Show the guest out!

880
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,230
Li Yun, I'll kill you!

881
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,740
Go!

882
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:56,910
Li Yun!

883
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,590
Back then,

884
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,890
I was just a weak woman.

885
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,480
Any random man

886
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,310
could forcibly drive me away.

887
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,350
Women have no chance

888
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,400
to argue in front of men.

889
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,390
But now, it’s different.

890
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,870
For the past 8 years,

891
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,190
I have sought out renowned masters

892
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,620
and diligently trained in martial arts.

893
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
I am now strong, with a sword in hand,

894
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,100
just for this very day.

895
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,210
Before coming to Yunding,

896
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,110
I had sworn

897
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,110
to uncover the truth.

898
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,110
If Chu Bin was killed by Li Yun,

899
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,660
I will kill him

900
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,000
to avenge my sister;

901
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,990
if her death

902
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,310
has nothing to do with Li Yun,

903
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,430
I will gouge out one of my own eyes

904
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,970
and take Chu Bin's remains

905
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,320
back to our hometown

906
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,510
to bury her next to our parents’ graves.

907
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,190
In that case,

908
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,890
please step aside.

909
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,030
Whether to uncover the cause of death

910
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,890
or to let Chu Bin return to her roots,

911
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,450
the coffin must be opened for the postmortem.

912
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,120
But my sister has been dead for 10 years.

913
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:00,910
I heard that

914
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,550
after 2 or 3 years of burial,

915
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,060
bodies decay into bones.

916
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,470
Can you

917
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,630
really determine the cause of death?

918
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,090
If this person can't do it,

919
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,070
then no one

920
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,350
in the Tang Dynasty can.

921
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,730
I am Su Wuming, a disciple of Detective Di

922
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,660
Heroine Chu, I hope you can trust me

923
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,560
and allow me to open the coffin.

924
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,360
A disciple of Detective Di?

925
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,830
There's a disciple of Detective Di in Yunding?

926
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,360
Although I am Detective Di's disciple,

927
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,070
I am not an official.

928
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,590
I am able to make a living in Yunding

929
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,650
all thanks to Sheriff Lu taking me in.

930
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,270
By the way,

931
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,330
Sheriff Lu is also a disciple of Detective Di

932
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,950
and is adept with both the pen and the sword.

933
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,410
His reputation and skills

934
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,110
far surpass mine.

935
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,600
Two disciples of Detective Di?

936
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,750
If you're not boasting,

937
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,180
I'll believe you.

00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,970
Mr. Su,

941
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,830
you can open the coffin now.

942
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,200
Heroine Chu,

943
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,880
I would like to ask you

944
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,920
to join me

945
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,140
in opening the coffin.

946
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,230

947
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,370
you have been so lonely

948
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,950
for these ten years.

949
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,190
I'm here to see you.

950
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,830
Don't rush to cry.

951
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,550
I am certain

952
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,820
there is no body

953
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,360
in the coffin.

954
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,440
What?

955
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,670
There is no body in the coffin?

956
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,020
I think I understood now,

957
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,910
but I still feel confused.

958
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:22,950
Su Wuming.

959
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,470
what's going on?

960
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,200
Yingtao.

961
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,110
Don't rush to ask.

962
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,860
Since he has already made such a bold claim,

963
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,590
let's open the coffin quickly.

964
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,570
Where is my sister?

965
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,520
Remove the tent.

966
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,760
Heroine Chu,

967
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,690
congratulations.

968
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,410
Just as this disciple of Detective Di

969
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,090
guessed,

970
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,690
your sister

971
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,390
is still alive.

972
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,500
Don't you find the name Lin Bei

973
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,840
strange?

974
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,640
Come and take a look.

975
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,590
Indeed.

976
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,990
"Lin" is "Chu" with out legs.

977
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,150
"Bei" is "Bin" without a head.

978
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,770
For a woman,

979
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,830
being betrayed by the man she deeply loves

980
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,700
is like losing a half of herself.

981
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,320
This must be

982
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,030
how Chu Bin truly feels.

983
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,390
Lin Bei is Chu Bin.

984
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,510
If that's the case,

985
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,470
the tomb must be an empty tomb

986
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,600
and the coffin must be an empty coffin!

987
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,360
We have no way of knowing what happened

988
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,900
ten years ago.

989
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,330
But those three portraits

990
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,610
are enough to prove

991
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,310
that our suspects

992
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,710
have not told the truth.

993
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,360
Indeed.

994
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,590
Now,

995
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,830
besides opening the coffin for postmortem,

996
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,760
there seems to be

997
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,150
no other way

998
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,470
to advance the investigation.
