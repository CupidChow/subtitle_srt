1
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,156
Alexa! Seriously?

2
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:14,057
What’s taking you so long?
The food’s getting cold!

3
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,063
Wait! Just a minute!

4
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,941
Hey! What are you doing?

5
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,719
Thank you, Lord, for the
food today. In Jesus name.

6
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:57,102
- Amen.
- Amen.

7
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:58,188
[clears throat]

8
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:01,784
I'll be home late later, okay?
I'll just leave your food in the fridge.

9
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,831
[clears throat]

10
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:07,992
My beautiful, very kind older sister...

11
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:09,032
Mm?

12
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:11,245
Sis, you look so pretty today!

13
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:12,535
Do you have five hundred pesos?

14
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:15,813
- Nope!
- Come on, sis...

15
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,661
What is it for now?

16
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:21,116
You know, I don’t believe in
your 'ghost projects' anymore.

17
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:23,555
Whatever.

18
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,140
Just eat. Hurry up, you'll be late.

19
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:31,960
- [panting]
- Hey?

20
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,421
- Why are you so winded?
- What happened to you?

21
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,008
Uh, sorry. I had to run.

22
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:39,514
I woke up late because our
clock at home is broken. Dang it!

23
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:42,483
Hey, what? Are you
still gonna eat? Let’s go!

24
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,179
Just a second. I want
to take some to go.

25
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,309
See? I'll take a lot.

26
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,503
- Wow, really? That's too much.
- Of course.

27
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:52,323
- As if you helped pay for it.
- Yeah, right.

28
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:54,478
Whatever. Let's go.
Come on! Let's go.

29
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:56,402
- Let's go!
- Darn it! I didn't even get a bite.

30
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,845
- Bye, Krista!
- Bye!

31
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,519
I love you, sis! Mwah!

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,485
Here comes the food! There you go.

33
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,930
Yes! I need some
brain power now.

34
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:35,648
Good thing I took some
food from your house.

35
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:36,957
Yeah, right.

36
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,977
Oh! Did you get to study?

37
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:42,055
- Not much.
- Me neither.

38
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,308
Let's just sit next to Galvez
so we can actually pass.

39
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,602
Him? Does he even let people copy?

40
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,896
Definitely! He has a crush on me!

41
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,872
Duh? You know how pretty I am.

42
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:54,194
Wow! Are you?

43
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:57,597
Maybe he'll be the one to take your
virginity, Dee, watch out. I'm telling you.

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,944
As if!

45
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,950
Maybe if he lets me copy
four more times, then fine.

46
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,177
I’d let him get to third
base for five minutes.

47
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,620
[laughs]

48
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,645
Whatever!

49
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,076
Hey, look!

50
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:42,781
You got caught, huh?

51
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,292
Damn those glances!

52
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:48,766
My kinetic energy worked, girl.
He noticed me!

53
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,293
Miggy isn't interested in you.

54
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:57,074
He's into cheerleaders, or like
those who play tennis, the tall ones.

55
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:58,611
You're ruining my vibe!

56
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:03,545
Of course, I'm your best friend!
I'm just doing my job.

57
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,813
- [excited chatters]
- [muttering]

58
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,110
- Oops! Watch it!
- Last one's ugly.

59
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:19,586
- Woah!
- Hey!

60
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,227
Damn it! Seriously?

61
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:26,268
Hey! Sorry. My friend's a bit clumsy.
He doesn't watch where he's going.

62
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,923
Uh... It's fine.

63
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:33,128
Uh, I always notice you around here.

64
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:34,908
Huh?

65
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:35,991
Me?

66
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:37,743
Of course, you.

67
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:42,681
By the way, what's your name?

68
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:45,816
Alexa.

69
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,119
Miggy.

70
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,268
[shy chuckles]

71
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:53,058
Alright.

72
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,319
I'll go ahead.

73
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:58,554
[giddy squeals]

74
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,951
I love you.

75
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:18,545
- Alexa?
- What?

76
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,104
- Alexa?
- What?

77
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,178
Come on, let's eat!
I'm starving!

78
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
[heavy sigh]

79
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:36,974
Shit!

80
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,729
[heavy sigh]

81
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,064
Shit!

82
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:48,360
I'm going grocery shopping tomorrow.
Make a list of what you need.

83
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:51,602
Yeah, sure. Though, sis,
can I borrow five hundred?

84
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,438
Am I your piggy bank?

85
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,794
That's why I'm borrowing.
How about three hundred?

86
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,859
Are you my employee?
You think, you're that lucky?

87
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,920
Just trying! I’m just testing
how spoiled you let me be.

88
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,741
Am I Dad?

89
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,511
Hm? He spoiled you, not me.
You were his favorite.

90
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,790
Speaking of... next week
is Dad's death anniversary.

91
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:18,816
Don't make other plans.

92
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,870
I'm ordering food for dinner
and Aunt Nida will also be here.

93
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,731
Huh? But Dee and I already have plans.

94
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:26,079
No, you don’t.

95
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,917
But that’s important!

96
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,064
I already said no!

97
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,208
- Well? What? Can you even lift me?
- Of course.

98
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,584
- Come on, let's see!
- Fine.

99
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,312
- Go!
- Not bad! You've got strength.

100
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,415
[playful laugh]

101
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,221
[gasps]

102
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,650
Ah!

103
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,438
- Hi, Miggy!
- Alexa.

104
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:00,832
I'd like to invite you two to
the party later. If you're free.

105
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,727
Uh, I'm Dee.

106
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:03,937
Miggy.

107
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:05,047
This is my friend, Anton.

108
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:08,436
Hi.

109
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:14,431
We won the inter-college
basketball game earlier. So...

110
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,114
Wow!

111
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,464
We're planning to have a
party at Miggy’s place later.

112
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,955
Uh... Sure, sure!

113
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,300
Hope you guys can make it.

114
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,561
Uhm... We'll see. Right, Alexa?

115
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,631
Uh, yeah. We still
have an exam though.

116
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,132
No big deal.

117
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,577
You know, a party is rare.
Exams are always there.

118
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,738
- Right?
- [laughing]

119
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,557
- Yeah, that's right!
- I guess so.

120
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:42,959
[laughing continues]

121
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:47,930
- Alright. See you.
- Uh, yeah. Bye-bye!

122
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:48,955
- Bye!
- Later.

123
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,622
[giggling in excitement]

124
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:16,217
[indistinct chatters]

125
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,348
Oops, miss!

126
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,226
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry, miss. My apologies.

127
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:27,101
[chatters continued]

128
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:30,195
Shoot, Alexa. I seriously
need to go to the bathroom.

129
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:32,203
Don't leave me here.

130
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:34,063
I'll be right back.

131
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,362
Wait for me. Just
stay right here.

132
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,157
Maybe we should just go home?

133
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,744
Are you serious? When was the last
time we were invited to a party like this?

134
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,489
Just stay here. Wait up.

135
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:45,514
Girl!

136
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:49,715
You came!

137
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,629
- Hi!
- Hi!

138
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:54,126
- Dee just ran to the restroom.
- I'll introduce you, come on!

139
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,385
Guys, guys! This is Alexa.

140
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,429
They're my classmates.

141
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,152
This is Alexa, guys.

142
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,925
Is it too loud?

143
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:12,287
It's fine.

144
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,145
Do you wanna hang out on the balcony?

145
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,793
- Sure.
- Come on.

146
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,518
You're all jerks! [chuckles]

147
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,457
Well, a win is a win, right?

148
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:50,147
What about Dee?

149
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:51,766
I wonder what happened to her?

150
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,815
Don't worry about her.
I saw she's with Anton.

151
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
She's safe.

152
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:59,752
Okay, that's good. I thought
she got lost in your huge house.

153
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,142
It's my dad's, not mine.

154
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,616
Wow! Humble.

155
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,471
You and Dee are
really inseparable, huh?

156
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:10,587
I guess so.

157
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,584
She’s been my best friend
since high school.

158
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:16,209
And to think, we’re still together now.

159
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,664
That's... really sweet.

160
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,177
Are you gonna kiss me?

161
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:01,886
I'm so hard right now.

162
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:03,826
Can you feel it?

163
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:06,131
Yeah, I can.

164
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,542
Kiss me down there.

165
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:11,631
Huh?

166
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,989
Go down on me.

167
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:16,005
No one’s looking.

168
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,190
[giddy excitement]

169
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:56,065
Hey, I went home last night.

170
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,255
What are you doing?

171
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:04,712
I said, I went home last night.

172
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,723
Why did you suddenly disappear?

173
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:08,652
You got scared, didn't you?

174
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Uh...

175
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,130
What’d you say?

176
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,224
Hey! Are you on drugs?
It’s Dee!

177
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:17,054
I know!

178
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,440
- We have an exam, right?
- Yeah!

179
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:25,646
Seriously? It's like
I'm talking to an AI.

180
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,696
Hi, Miggy!

181
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,750
[chattering]

182
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,233
Are you awake?

183
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,489
Why were you avoiding me earlier?

184
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,788
I didn't see you. Really?

185
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,338
Yeah, I said hi, hmp!

186
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,552
[giggles]

187
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,392
Fine. I’m not mad anymore.

188
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,566
Send me a selfie.
I already miss you.

189
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,041
[internal squealing]

190
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:16,959
Oh, why did you call?

191
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,419
Send me a nude, please.

192
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,006
Huh?

193
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:24,842
Are you serious?

194
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,024
Please...

195
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:29,979
Why?

196
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:33,518
Because I'm masturbating right now.

197
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:36,367
Huh?

198
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:39,334
You’re crazy!

199
00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:43,419
Come on, send me some nudes.
I want to see you.

200
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,502
Fine. Just a second.

201
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,567
[giggles]

202
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,124
Hey!

203
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,279
What's new with us, sis?

204
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:30,851
Uh, nothing.

205
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:33,373
Nothing?

206
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:34,807
Really?

207
00:22:35,198 --> 00:22:37,117
I've been watching you for a while.

208
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:39,416
Looks like something's up.

209
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:40,680
Stop messing around.

210
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:42,844
Look at what you're doing.

211
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:45,398
You're not even
rinsing them properly.

212
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,156
My bad.

213
00:22:48,391 --> 00:22:49,575
So...

214
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,116
So… What?

215
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:54,995
So, do you have a suitor?

216
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:56,124
Sis!

217
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,254
Hm! My baby is a grown woman now.

218
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:07,011
Who is it? Handsome?
Kind? Rich? Will he marry you?

219
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,972
You might have a child before me, huh?

220
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,621
How will you have a child if
you don't even have a boyfriend?

221
00:23:13,941 --> 00:23:15,170
So he's your boyfriend now?

222
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,603
No, not yet.

223
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,113
So he's courting you?

224
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,709
Oh that's why you're
completely head over heels!

225
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,067
Whatever.

226
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,694
Give it here.

227
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:27,256
- Okay, I'll rinse it.
- Go. You rinse it.

228
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,961
You're forgetting to wash properly.

229
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:30,784
Just rinse it!

230
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:44,382
- Who do you live with here?
- [whispering] Shh!

231
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:46,032
My older sister. Quick, get inside!

232
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:07,190
You're annoying!

233
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,605
Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

234
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:25,294
- Are you still a virgin?
- Huh?

235
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:27,922
Are you not?

236
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:49,465
- Do you remember that thing...
- I have to go now.

237
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:51,346
I still have training tomorrow.

238
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:07,196
Bye.

239
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:25,686
You're so stupid!

240
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:27,614
Just stop it, Dee.

241
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:32,544
One week! He hasn't
talked to you in a whole week!

242
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:34,771
What other reason do you need?

243
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:38,094
Maybe he's doing something.
Busy. Right?

244
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,501
Are you insane?

245
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:44,172
He's been ignoring you.
He's not even replying to you, right?

246
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:46,619
After he took your virginity.

247
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,426
What more do you need?

248
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:54,216
Do you want me to
punch his balls? Do you?

249
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,585
Just tell me! Do you?

250
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,738
- Dee, just stop! No.
- You want that? No! Tell me.

251
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:04,017
- No, just let it go. Stop.
- No! We have to! What? Come on!

252
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:17,864
Don't try to hide it.
I know you smoke.

253
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,050
But can you cut back?

254
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,687
The food outside hasn't been touched.

255
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,567
Are you okay?

256
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,326
Yeah, I'm fine.

257
00:29:45,238 --> 00:29:46,281
This is annoying.

258
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:48,268
What is?

259
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,208
I don't know.

260
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,688
You're going to open up,
and then nothing.

261
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:00,747
Move over.

262
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,872
Is this a boy problem?

263
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:11,171
I don't know.

264
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:17,577
I'm here for you, okay?

265
00:30:20,614 --> 00:30:21,614
Hey!

266
00:30:22,116 --> 00:30:23,367
Where are you going?

267
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:25,484
I'm leaving.

268
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,060
Huh?

269
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,368
I'm going to Dee's.

270
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:32,016
Uh, hold on. It's Dad's death
anniversary today, remember?

271
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,457
- Yeah, I know.
- I ordered food.

272
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:36,210
Just make sure!
Our aunt's coming!

273
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:37,795
- they want to see you.
- I said I know!

274
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,597
What the hell! You're disgusting!

275
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,016
Chill!

276
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,355
Migs was right all along...

277
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,274
You're something else!

278
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:48,456
Are you going home?

279
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,578
Damn it! You... you losers!

280
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,245
Losers?

281
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,747
Us?

282
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,879
Are you sure it's us, not you?

283
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,131
Fine, go home.

284
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,134
Go.

285
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:16,306
What time is it?

286
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:18,927
I'm not in the mood.

287
00:42:19,343 --> 00:42:22,430
Damn it! Aunt Nida and the
others came here looking for you.

288
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,457
You didn't even answer your calls.

289
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:26,380
We were going to take pictures.

290
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:28,680
I don't care about them, okay?

291
00:42:28,855 --> 00:42:31,107
And I don't care
about your pictures.

292
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,611
- Go take pictures yourselves.
- Hey!

293
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:35,019
- Ouch!
- If you can't respect me

294
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:36,854
show some respect to our family.

295
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:39,641
What are they going to say
when they see you like that?

296
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:42,873
Their opinion of me
is not my problem.

297
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:46,601
What would Dad say if he saw you?

298
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:47,823
There we go.

299
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:51,496
It's always Dad, Dad, Dad!
He didn't even care about me!

300
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:55,430
You were his favorite!
Just accept it, sis.

301
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:58,554
Dad is dead!
He's gone! He's dead!

302
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:21,500
Just forget about Miggy, Lex.

303
00:43:22,653 --> 00:43:26,323
That guy is such a damn idiot.
There are so many jerks in the world!

304
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:29,740
That's true.

305
00:43:30,924 --> 00:43:32,465
It's so infuriating!

306
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,730
Guys just use us!

307
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,389
It's so unfair!

308
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,827
We women just end up
being submissive to them.

309
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:45,752
Dee, no.

310
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,011
No... what?

311
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,419
No.

312
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,357
What? What do you mean no?

313
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,968
Why do we have to keep following them?

314
00:43:58,796 --> 00:43:59,888
That's what I said!

315
00:44:01,278 --> 00:44:03,280
Nothing we can do,
it’s already done.

316
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:08,145
The important thing is
for you to just figure out

317
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,256
how you're going to apologize to Krista.

318
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:19,786
Why do they get to
be in control? Why?

319
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:40,102
[laughing]

320
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,673
Hey, Dee!

321
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:45,391
What's on your mind?

322
00:49:46,745 --> 00:49:49,498
Huh? It's nothing!
What are you talking about?

323
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:54,450
What are you doing, Alexa?
Are you going insane?

324
00:49:54,515 --> 00:49:55,910
You know we're here often.

325
00:49:56,844 --> 00:50:01,276
It's all good. You're overreacting!
He got something out of it too.

326
00:50:03,822 --> 00:50:04,906
You've changed.

327
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,203
Dee!

328
00:50:12,457 --> 00:50:13,667
Too dramatic.

329
00:50:41,853 --> 00:50:45,189
Keep going! Yes! That’s great!

330
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,132
What else do you want?

331
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:54,356
Squeeze your boobs.

332
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,660
Shit!

333
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,017
Spread your legs for me, baby!

334
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,233
I can't do this.
Where are you from?

335
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:15,024
Where I'm from? Why?

336
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,667
Ah! You're so hot!

337
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:19,829
I'm leaving now.

338
00:52:22,504 --> 00:52:24,005
Just delete my number.

339
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:00,681
[startled] Alexa?

340
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,042
Alexa. I’m sorry!

341
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,901
I'm just curious.

342
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,738
Why, Dee?

343
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:25,184
Why?

344
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,934
You're my friend!

345
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,929
And you're my best friend.

346
00:54:36,195 --> 00:54:37,966
I deserve this.

347
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,448
I'm not mad.

348
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:35,686
What's up, bitch?

349
00:59:35,885 --> 00:59:37,679
[grunting]

350
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:39,737
Oh, damn it!
What the hell! Hey!

351
00:59:41,446 --> 00:59:42,530
Stay right there.

352
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:44,798
Damn you! Are you crazy?

353
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:49,959
What?

354
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,165
What did you say?

355
00:59:58,711 --> 00:59:59,754
That's what I thought.

356
01:00:02,177 --> 01:00:03,261
Alexa?

357
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:15,315
Hey, Alexa, you're gonna like this...

358
01:01:38,775 --> 01:01:40,193
Sis...

359
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,619
[crying]

360
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,751
Sis...

361
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,298

Sis...

363
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,693
I'm not okay.

364
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,745
[crying continues]

365
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,341
I’m here for you.

366
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,103
I’m always here for you.
