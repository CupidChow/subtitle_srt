1
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,500
Get closer.

2
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,070
Come on.

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,280
You need to make sure your body is warm enough...

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,739
to not get hurt on duty.

5
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,579
Goodness, you've raised one great son.

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,520
He'd want to go out and have fun, but he's here working with his dad.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,159
I heard you did very well on your last test too.

8
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,530
Goodness, he kept showing off how good you were...

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,229
That was unnecessary. I didn't do that.

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,770
Dad, may I use the restroom?

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,799
- It's all the way inside. - Okay.

12
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,539
Your son is tall and handsome.

13
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,119
Guys like you who only have a daughter have no idea...

14
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,380
how reassuring it is to have him.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,020
Goodness, I wouldn't change a truck full of those huge boys...

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,559
for my daughter.

17
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,130
My gosh.

18
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:24,639
(Restroom)

19
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,139
Hey, what's that?

20
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:34,309
You always say you have no money. You got a new watch?

21
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:35,979
This thing?

22
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:39,180
Sung Jae got it for us as our wedding anniversary gift.

23
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:40,449
Jealous?

24
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,789
Did we get new materials early this morning?

25
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:47,160
I saw Lee come in with some materials late last night.

26
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,800
What? We'll have to check.

27
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,059
Let's see...

28
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,169
Gosh, I need to take a leak too.

29
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,839
Stop drinking so much water.

30
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,440
- The weather seems colder today. - Tell me about it.

31
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,139
- My gosh. - Goodness.

32
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:06,949
Hey, Lee!

33
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,319
What's with him?

34
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:51,159
Help...

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,159
Help... Help me.

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,251
How... How long...

37
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,251
has it been?

38
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,390
I don't know.

39
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,541
I must survive.

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,411
I can't die here...

41
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,050
and leave my daughter behind.

42
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,020
Sir, don't talk.

43
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,520
Let's...

44
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,420
Let's get out of here alive.

45
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,571
Sir.

46
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,270
Sir.

47
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,611
Sir, are you asleep?

48
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,181
You shouldn't fall asleep.

49
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,181
How old...

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,020
is your daughter?

51
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,090
Seven.

52
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,200
This is her.

53
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,241
If you see her, tell her...

54
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,640
that I love her so much.

55
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,460
Hang in there.

56
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,700
You must survive...

57
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:22,071
and...

58
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,991
I will survive.

59
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,861
I won't die.

60
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,140
I won't give in.

61
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:57,410
I will...

62
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,261
Hey, lift this!

63
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,931
Lift it up!

64
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,131
Hey, don't you hear a sound?

65
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:28,200
- Do you hear that? - Where is it coming from?

66
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,640
Over here!

67
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,011
Sir...

68
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:59,700
(Memorial Altar for Victims of the Taejung Town Collapse)

69
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:05,770
Eat slowly.

70
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:12,611
Thank you.

71
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:20,691
Do you...

72
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,691
miss your dad?

73
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,140
You know what?

74
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,910
You shouldn't grow up...

75
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,511
and become like your dad.

76
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:47,580
Why not?

77
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,191
I love my dad.

78
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,421
Do you know why he died?

79
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,801
Because he was poor and incompetent.

80
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,830
That's why he had to work like a dog and die in vain.

81
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,941
Misfortunes only come to those who are poor and weak.

82
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,850
People who are weak, incompetent,

83
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,381
and poor...

84
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,921
should never live.

85
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:42,900
This was his.

86
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:56,920
Then...

87
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,861
were you the one who gave me this watch?

88
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,320
Were you...

89
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,160
that girl?

90
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,570
Do you see the time?

91
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,611
So this was it.

92
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,851
This was why those things...

93
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,081
happened to us.

94
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:32,890
Do you remember everything?

95
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,361
I do.

96
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,331
Everything you had said back at the police station...

97
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:44,570
was true.

98
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,300
Is it really true that we're connected...

99
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,371
to one month in the future?

100
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,251
Check for yourself.

101
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,621
(Kim Seo Jin)

102
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,091
Ms. Han.

103
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,331
Hello? Ms. Han.

104
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,761
Are you...

105
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,331
me?

106
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,810
Do you perhaps know my father?

107
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,111
- Were you the one? - Are you...

108
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:29,640
me?

109
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,290
Yes, I'm Kim Seo Jin.

110
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,050
The date here...

111
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,221
is October 23.

112
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:45,060
Listen carefully. On October 9,

113
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Da Bin and Hyun Chae will die in a car accident.

114
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,400
Then on October 20, Ms. Han will be murdered.

115
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,800
- Who on earth will do that? - It's Lee Taek Gyu.

116
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,371
But the real mastermind...

117
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,081
is someone else.

118
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:04,410
But the real mastermind is someone else.

119
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,180
Yes, it's the person you're thinking of right now.

120
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,721
If we don't stop him, this will happen again.

121
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:14,420
But we don't have enough time until the accident...

122
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,890
to stop Chairman Yu.

123
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:37,810
Do you think you can digest everything that you heard right now?

124
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:39,650
Hyun Chae, Da Bin,

125
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,221
and even you will die?

126
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:48,520
Tell me the time, place, details of the accident,

127
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,890
and everything that my future self knows.

128
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,160
Tell me everything.

129
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:58,400
There were no CCTV cameras or witnesses on that road.

130
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,940
Lee Taek Gyu hit the car you were all riding in.

131
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:04,371
Your wife and your daughter lost their lives.

132
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,241
The police think you were trying to commit suicide with them.

133
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:11,481
Mr. Lee is Chairman Yu's henchman.

134
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:12,981
He probably did it to conceal the truth...

135
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,381
regarding the collapse of Taejung Town.

136
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:17,721
I don't remember everything related to Mr. Lee just yet,

137
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,190
but the overall picture was what I had imagined.

138
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,631
Perhaps, I was finally rescued...

139
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,800
in order to reveal the truth.

140
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:30,831
And...

141
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,701
you're also the last gift my dad had given me.

142
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:38,310
Now,

143
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:41,741
what do you need me to do?

144
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,761
Mr. Kim.

145
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:03,900
I've found a temporary place where you can stay.

146
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,300
I've hired medical staff that'll monitor your condition,

147
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,670
so you won't have to worry.

148
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,540
Thank you. I'll take good care of her.

149
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:23,251
You should worry more about yourself.

150
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:26,690
Nothing will get done if you're arrested.

151
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,991
I won't let that happen until Chairman Yu is brought down.

152
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:34,131
My phone will stay off to avoid being traced.

153
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,471
If anything happens, please contact Mr. Im.

154
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:41,601
Thank you for everything. You should rest now.

155
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,420
Ms. Kwak, let's go.

156
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,491
I'm grateful for all your hard work.

157
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,861
Don't mention it.

158
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:06,530
How much of it do you know?

159
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,331
I know that Mr. Kim...

160
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,400
will bring Ae Ri back to life.

161
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:19,971
Thank you.

162
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,241
Soo Jung will be here soon.

163
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,951
We'll take turns staying with you, so relax and rest.

164
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,361
(Kairos)

165
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:44,631
(Episode 13)

166
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,471
Hello?

167
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:53,270
Ms. Kwak, this is Kim Jin Ho.

168
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:58,481
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

169
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,180
Yes, I am.

170
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:04,091
Once Kim Seo Jin said that Chairman Yu was after me,

171
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:08,261
I discarded my phone and went into hiding.

172
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,591
I'm glad.

173
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,261
I read the article regarding your daughter.

174
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,631
You told me, right?

175
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:17,201
If anything happened to you or your daughter,

176
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,170
what you gave me...

177
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,001
Anyway, what now?

178
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,270
I'd like that back now.

179
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,534
Where are we regarding Kim Seo Jin's whereabouts?

180
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:47,633
We pinged his phone for about a minute last night,

181
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:49,204
but that was all.

182
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,174
Where was the phone turned on?

183
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,143
We checked it out but to no avail.

184
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:56,013
He might get sloppy again, so keep an eye out.

185
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:57,213
- Got it. - Mr. Park!

186
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:00,753
Mr. Seo.

187
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:03,713
Has Kim Seo Jin been in contact with you?

188
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,223
That's what I'd like to ask.

189
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,324
When will you locate him?

190
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:08,493
We've been searching,

191
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,763
but his phone and credit card hasn't been used.

192
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:12,963
So it could stay this way?

193
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:15,133
At least send out an APB.

194
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:16,334
We're already on it.

195
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:19,034
However, checkpoints won't be of use...

196
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,873
unless Kim Seo Jin makes a move.

197
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:23,633
But we're running out of time!

198
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:28,774
What do you mean by that?

199
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:33,143
Well,

200
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:36,113
it's not good to drag it out.

201
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:39,084
One can only stay hidden well with another's help.

202
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:42,554
Could there be anyone who would help him?

203
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:44,763
I'm not sure.

204
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:49,164
About Ms. Han Ae Ri who was murdered recently.

205
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:50,733
The young woman who was charged...

206
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,133
with attempted kidnapping of Mr. Kim's daughter?

207
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,103
Where's her mother?

208
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,003
Why do you ask?

209
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,704
Does this have something to do with Mr. Kim?

210
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,013
No.

211
00:17:03,343 --> 00:17:06,143
Just let me know if you find anything.

212
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:10,214
(Violent Crimes Team 1)

213
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:14,953
That request sure sounded like an order.

214
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:17,093
He's probably on edge with what's going on at work,

215
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:18,393
so just let it slide, sir.

216
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:24,103
(Kangil Police Station)

217
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:26,863
The one who shares Kim Seo Jin's goal.

218
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,474
The one most likely to help him.

219
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:37,843
It has to be Kwak Song Ja.

220
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:17,054
Mr. Kim, it's Im Geon Wook.

221
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:29,433
Did something happen to Ms. Kwak?

222
00:18:30,863 --> 00:18:32,804
Kim Jin Ho contacted her.

223
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:36,534
He'll personally bring the package to her.

224
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:38,474
When should I be there?

225
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:40,843
I'll call the motel as soon as the package arrives.

226
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:43,214
The phone in here works, right?

227
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:44,613
Yes.

228
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:48,214
This must be uncomfortable for you.

229
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:51,554
Still, stay hidden and don't go anywhere.

230
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:53,554
I'll get you whatever you need.

231
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:54,693
Thank you.

232
00:18:56,524 --> 00:18:57,724
I apologize...

233
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,093
for the misunderstanding and my inconsiderate behaviour.

234
00:19:01,093 --> 00:19:03,893
That was wrong of me.

235
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:06,064
We won't let her anywhere near you again,

236
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:07,574
so please forgive her just this once.

237
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:09,373
There's no need for you to plead her case.

238
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,804
The law will take care of it.

239
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:16,774
I know this will sound like an excuse,

240
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:21,353
but I had no idea that I had been in contact with Ms. Han.

241
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:25,984
Just keep the promise you made...

242
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,254
about saving her.

243
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:42,673
Now, what do you need me to do?

244
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:45,544
We need to bring down Chairman Yu.

245
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,673
And in order to do so, we need evidence.

246
00:19:47,673 --> 00:19:49,643
I must stop Lee Taek Gyu first.

247
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:52,214
Doing so will buy me some time...

248
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:55,413
to find definite evidence that'll bring Chairman Yu down.

249
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:57,214
How can you possibly stop Lee Taek Gyu?

250
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:59,024
In a previous timeline,

251
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:00,724
he hired Kim Jin Ho to kidnap Da Bin...

252
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,024
and then murdered Kim Jin Ho and my mom,

253
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:04,524
but that never ended up happening again.

254
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:08,133
He's probably the one who kills me in a month,

255
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:10,193
but that hasn't happened.

256
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,943
I know a way to remove Lee Taek Gyu.

257
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:23,214
Chairman Yu probably believes...

258
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:25,744
that I or your mom will contact Kim Jin Ho.

259
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:29,214
We'll set up a false hideout for him...

260
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:31,224
and get Chairman Yu to make a move.

261
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:32,953
Or I could receive the evidence from Kim Jin Ho and...

262
00:20:32,953 --> 00:20:36,423
No, we can't put Kim Jin Ho in danger again.

263
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:39,093
I'll protect him any way I can.

264
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:40,933
The evidence Chairman Yu is after.

265
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:44,203
My mom has had it for a long time.

266
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:47,234
So I'll do it.

267
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:51,443
Are you saying...

268
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:54,574
you'll meet with Lee Taek Gyu?

269
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,413
Once Chairman Yu finds out that my mom gave me the evidence,

270
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,584
he'll send Lee Taek Gyu after me.

271
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:02,514
If all goes well, we might be able to bring down Chairman Yu too.

272
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:05,383
- No way. - I'll die in a month at this rate.

273
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,524
It's only fitting that I do it.

274
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:09,953
That's not the same. This is far more dangerous.

275
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:12,294
Tell me where Lee Taek Gyu is.

276
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:14,633
I'll meet with him.

277
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,734
Look, Ms. Han.

278
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,234
What happens in the future...

279
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,373
can be changed by us in this timeline,

280
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:27,774
but what happens here will be permanent.

281
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:29,413
It can't be reversed or stopped.

282
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:30,814
I'm more...

283
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:33,514
than determined.

284
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:46,024
Darn it.

285
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:56,403
Hello?

286
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:00,804
This is Han Ae Ri.

287
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:17,093
(Chairman Yu Seo Il)

288
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,363
- Hello? - Mr. Yu.

289
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:27,163
Han Ae Ri contacted me a moment ago.

290
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:29,403
What did she say?

291
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:33,244
What you want from my mother is currently in my hands.

292
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:35,873
We should meet.

293
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:37,913
I'll hand it over,

294
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:40,744
so stop harassing my mother.

295
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:48,153
Meet with her. The package should be verified.

296
00:22:48,254 --> 00:22:50,853
And how should it be verified?

297
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:58,264
(Chairman Yu Seo Il)

298
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:05,908
Hello?

299
00:23:05,978 --> 00:23:07,137
Bring the thing.

300
00:23:08,478 --> 00:23:11,077
Don't try to do anything funny. Come out quietly, alone.

301
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:12,377
Let's meet.

302
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:14,887
I'll decide the time and place.

303
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:19,587
Who are you seeing?

304
00:23:24,297 --> 00:23:25,428
Who were you talking to?

305
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:33,238
Why should you do that?

306
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:36,067
After all, your mother came back,

307
00:23:36,107 --> 00:23:38,908
and you had to get detained to stop Da Bin from getting abducted.

308
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:42,008
It's all over. Why do you have to see Lee Taek Gyu again?

309
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:45,277
All of the strange things and absurd situations we went through...

310
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:46,377
aren't over yet.

311
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:48,287
We have to resolve the fundamental reason.

312
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:52,018
Will something happen to your mother again?

313
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:01,898
Where are you seeing him, and what's your plan?

314
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:05,938
- What? - We better be prepared this time.

315
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:07,268
We won't make another mistake.

316
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:10,168
Are you going to help me?

317
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,178
It's not like you'll stop if I ask you.

318
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:17,377
I won't let anything happen to you.

319
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:01,258
Mom.

320
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:03,627
Soo Jung, it's you.

321
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:10,268
It must be so much work for all of you.

322
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,797
I brought your favourite side dishes.

323
00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:27,018
- Excuse me. - Hello.

324
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:30,918
My relative is staying here. Could you tell me which unit it is?

325
00:25:31,117 --> 00:25:32,557
What's your relative's name?

326
00:25:34,287 --> 00:25:37,327
Kwak Song Ja. Ms. Kwak Song Ja.

327
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:46,367
Who is it?

328
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:13,057
(Kwak Song Ja)

329
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:14,468
(No results.)

330
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:15,797
There's no one here under that name.

331
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:21,268
Then what about Kim Seo Jin?

332
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,537
Mr. Kim Seo Jin.

333
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:25,777
(Kim Seo Jin)

334
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:27,037
(No results.)

335
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:29,307
I couldn't find Mr. Kim Seo Jin either.

336
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:32,918
Thank you.

337
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:42,027
Here.

338
00:26:44,758 --> 00:26:46,127
What's your plan now?

339
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:49,928
I'll give it to Mr. Kim Seo Jin.

340
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:53,168
Yes, I also believe he could...

341
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:56,668
expose the truth as it is.

342
00:26:57,768 --> 00:27:00,208
But if your daughter passed away,

343
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:02,847
shouldn't you report them to the prosecution or to a reporter?

344
00:27:04,178 --> 00:27:06,748
I can't trust the police or the prosecution anymore.

345
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:11,047
This is the only way I can save my daughter.

346
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:15,387
- What? What do you mean? - Mr. Kim, you would do...

347
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:18,228
everything you can for Ji Ah, can't you?

348
00:27:18,658 --> 00:27:19,658
I feel that way too.

349
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,768
I'll do anything and everything

350
00:27:23,668 --> 00:27:25,468
to save my daughter.

351
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:27,698
I see.

352
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:34,508
You should look after your health first.

353
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:37,777
If there's anything I can do to help,

354
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,748
let me know anytime.

355
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:44,087
Okay. Goodbye, then.

356
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:08,648
- Hello? - Sir, this is the lobby.

357
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:11,648
There's a call for you saying your order has arrived for pick up.

358
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:14,018
The caller said you'll know.

359
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:15,287
All right.

360
00:29:17,347 --> 00:29:20,547
Hello? Mr. Park, this is Seo Do Kyun.

361
00:29:21,547 --> 00:29:24,617
It's Kim Seo Jin. I just saw him.

362
00:29:47,377 --> 00:29:48,777
Is that you, Soo Jung?

363
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:18,428
Stop!

364
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:19,287
Mr. Park, in here.

365
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:22,057
Mr. Kim!

366
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:23,627
He must have fled.

367
00:33:26,758 --> 00:33:28,367
Mr. Park, I found a bloodstain.

368
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:34,698
He couldn't have gone far.

369
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:36,537
Yoon, check the CCTV.

370
00:33:36,537 --> 00:33:37,837
- Yes, sir. - Choi, downstairs.

371
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:39,508
- Kang, you're coming up with me. - Yes, sir.

372
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:42,077
Check if there's any blood in front of the elevators.

373
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:43,347
Yes, sir.

374
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,458
Ms. Kwak. Ms. Kwak?

375
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:56,688
Wake up. Wake up!

376
00:34:01,027 --> 00:34:02,998
Kim Seo Jin! Don't move!

377
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:06,168
Hands in the air.

378
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:08,938
Hands in the air!

379
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:13,278
Walk out.

380
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:15,907
Kang, go.

381
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:25,717
Mr. Kim Seo Jin, you're under emergency arrest for parricide.

382
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:29,057
You may consult an attorney, choose to remain silent,

383
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:30,228
and defend yourself.

384
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:32,528
But first, please get her to a hospital first.

385
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,228
Please get an ambulance.

386
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:35,427
She's unconscious.

387
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:39,498
Get an ambulance.

388
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:09,211

(Kim Seo Jin)

394
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,151
Why can't I reach you again?

395
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,291
Is something going on?

396
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,990
Did you see my mom?

397
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,490
Is the evidence solid?

398
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:54,561
What's it about?

399
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,600
I'm frustrated to death, so text me when you get this.

400
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:00,771
Please.

401
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,671
Your message has been recorded.

402
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,021
- Ae Ri. - You're here.

403
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:22,451
How did you find this place?

404
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,960
Mr. Kim did.

405
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:29,801
How can you trust him?

406
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:31,861
What if he betrays you again?

407
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,771
Mr. Im, I heard you'll be helping us.

408
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,980
If you're going to betray her again, you can stop this now.

409
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,510
I'm sorry about that time.

410
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,850
I'm in the process of getting my memories back.

411
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,650
That won't happen again from now on.

412
00:36:56,051 --> 00:36:59,021
I'll be fine this time. Don't worry.

413
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:04,601
But I can't reach you who's living a month ahead.

414
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,870
Do you think something happened?

415
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,101
I wonder.

416
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,310
The last text said he's on his way to get the evidence from my mom.

417
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,611
It'd be better if I found out...

418
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,981
what the evidence is about before I see Lee Taek Gyu tomorrow.

419
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:25,150
But first, let's figure out what we'll do tomorrow.

420
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:27,051
This way.

421
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:34,291
Darn it.

422
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:40,731
First off, come into this container with him.

423
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:43,641
Over there, there,

424
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:47,041
and right here, I'll put some cameras up.

425
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:51,210
I'll do anything to make him believe I have the evidence.

426
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,381
Mr. Im, you and I must have the entire situation under control.

427
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:01,791
Then I'll be nearby.

428
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:03,720
And...

429
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:06,460
take this.

430
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:08,761
A location tracker?

431
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:11,400
Just in case. Keep it with you.

432
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:15,771
We have to make sure we get something this time.

433
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,370
So even if it looks like I may fall in danger,

434
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,271
you can't make a rash move.

435
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:23,310
Do you have to take things this far?

436
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,840
Nineteen years ago,

437
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,680
I lived...

438
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:31,951
thanks to Ms. Han's father.

439
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,490
He gave up the last bit of water...

440
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,791
for me.

441
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,460
If it hadn't been for him,

442
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:49,470
I would've died back then.

443
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,141
I will not...

444
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,280
let her fall in danger.

445
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:10,420
Let's talk inside.

446
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,090
What?

447
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,730
Let's go somewhere else. There's someone I need you to meet.

448
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,460
- Who is it? - You'll see when you get there.

- What should we do now? - Get behind them, Mr. Im.

All right. What is this that you have?

468
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:36,636
I heard you had evidence that I was evil.

469
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:39,366
I'm sure you know better than I do.

470
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:42,876
You tormented my mom all along because of it.

471
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:47,946
I never expected to see you in person.

472
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:50,616

475
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:57,626
the mistakes you weren't aware of could bring you down.

476

One small hole...

477
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:03,227
in a tent or a big building could bring it down.

478
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:07,467

Is that what the evidence you have is saying?

486
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:30,956
That I didn't stop it?

487
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:34,356
I have proof that Yujung is just as responsible...

488
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:36,627
as Banyoung is regarding that incident.

- Escort her back home. - Yes, sir.

- and put out an APB. - Yes, sir.

00:48:14,836 --> 00:48:16,846
We need an ambulance here now.

511
00:48:21,446 --> 00:48:23,686
- Let's go. - Okay.

512
00:48:29,017 --> 00:48:30,427
Will we be able to find her?

521
00:48:50,576 --> 00:48:51,677
Sure.

522
00:49:01,657 --> 00:49:03,586
Right before the crash,

523
00:49:04,226 --> 00:49:06,627
we found out that you stepped on the gas.

524
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,897
And we found substances from your sleeping pill...

525
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:12,997
in Ms. Kang Hyun Chae and Da Bin's blood.

526
00:49:16,596 --> 00:49:18,336
Are you going to remain silent?

527
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:22,777
All the evidence is pointing to you as the suspect.

528
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:26,606

533
00:49:43,456 --> 00:49:45,226

00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:48,196

537
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:55,976

549

did you find his phone?

550
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,787
Yes, it's in the evidence room.

551
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:44,757
Why do you ask?

552
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:49,096
It's nothing. Please let me know if you need my testimony.

553
00:50:49,157 --> 00:50:50,267
Sure.

554
00:51:16,517 --> 00:51:18,627
What should we do about her?

555
00:51:24,966 --> 00:51:27,767
It's all right. It'll be all right.

556

558
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:37,137

We lost track of the car.

562
00:52:49,147 --> 00:52:50,686
He must've taken a route without any CCTV cameras.

563
00:52:51,446 --> 00:52:52,817
Then, what now?

564
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:54,486
We'll have to look for him ourselves.

565
