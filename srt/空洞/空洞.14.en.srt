00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:29,041
Mr. Im, this is Kim Seo Jin.

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,351
I'm in front of Ms. Han's house, but no one seems to be home.

5
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,380
Last month, she got Lee Taek Gyu.

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,821
Both my daughter and my wife are alive.

7
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,660
Everything has changed.

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,660
Then why... Why is Ae Ri still dead?

9
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:48,901
What did you say?

10
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,770
Ae Ri is still dead,

11
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,141
and her mom is in the ICU.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,410
Does that mean...

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,940
Lee Taek Gyu wasn't the killer?

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,380
You promised to save her!

15
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,291
This was all done by the chairman of Yujung Constructions, wasn't it?

16
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,161
Did you get what Mr. Kim Jin Ho brought?

17
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:24,530
No, I had to run out of the studio apartment in a hurry.

18
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,500
I haven't received it.

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,370
Then where in the world is that...

20
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:32,241
Where is that thing now?

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,780
It wasn't in the apartment when Soo Jung and I...

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,511
cleaned out Ms. Kwak's stuff.

23
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:45,291
We'd have to meet Mr. Kim from a month ago and get it.

24
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:47,661
He had called Ms. Kwak before,

25
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:49,360
so I'm sure she has his number somewhere.

26
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:50,491
I'll look for it.

27
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:57,470
It'll be 10:33pm soon. You should speak with Ae Ri.

May I speak with Ms. Han?

31
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,841
She is sleeping after taking sedatives.

32
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,941
Is she badly injured?

00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,480
Hello? Is she okay?

34
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,960
By the way, who are you?

35
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:06,261
I'm Kim Seo Jin. Is she okay?

36
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,830
Are you at the hospital?

37
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,730
Thankfully, she's okay.

38
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,930
I'm relieved.

39
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,841
But really, who are you?

40
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,640
Are you really Mr. Kim?

41
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,111
I'll call you again later.

Did you not go home yesterday?

45
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,311
I was at the hospital.

46
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,210
How is she?

47
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,251
She's not severely injured.

48
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,580
What will you do with Lee Taek Gyu?

49
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,150
- Where is he right now? - He's locked up.

50
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,290
He was caught red-handed for doing something terrible.

51
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,790
And we couldn't risk him running away,

52
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,290
so we requested an arrest warrant.

53
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,460
Then he won't be free for a while.

54
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,530
His charges of kidnapping and attempted murder...

55
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,270
can be proven.

56
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,931

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,241
I'm not even in pain. I'm totally fine. Okay?

59
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,481
Come on, Soo Jung.

60
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,981

63
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:44,660

66
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,311
Mom, I'm really fine.

67
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,981
We just spoke to your doctor. He said you can leave.

68
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:06,811
Soo Jung, go fill out the papers with Ms. Kwak.

69
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,421
- Hey. - What? What did you say?

70
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:15,561
You can stay here. I'll do it by myself.

71
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,290
No, let me come with you.

72

77
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,991

Gosh, it's my fault. I'm sorry.

79

Hey, you should worry about yourself.

80
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:58,301
It's obvious that Lee Taek Gyu is just someone's henchman.

81
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,941
You're still not safe until we catch Chairman Yu. Right?

82
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,790

83

91

The majority of the residents had wanted this for a long time.

92
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,900
- And the method of demolition? - I believe we should blast it...

93
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,111
since they're large and will inconvenience the residents less.

How much do you remember?

98
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,800

100

But you probably don't remember that...

but I couldn't find his number.

112
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:58,511
I think he made the call through a payphone,

113
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:01,211
but for now, there's no way to locate him.

114

I saw your wife at that studio apartment.

Back then, I didn't know if it was related to Da Bin's kidnapping,

143

so I figured it'd be best not to tell you.

144

I wouldn't have believed you anyway.

145
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,131
Not unless I saw it myself.

Don't provoke Chairman Yu.

154
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,341
It'll put you and Da Bin in danger.

I know that no explanation...

169
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,831
can help you understand right now.

170
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,501
It must've been hard for you...

171
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,640
to keep this secret all to yourself.

173
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,851
is my only goal.

174
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,820
It's why I was adamant about not telling you anything.

175
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:46,390
But now,

176

178
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,001
as much as you want to protect me.

179
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:58,400
That's not your job.

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,731
It's what parents should do.

You've always done what's best for me...

00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,870
and I know exactly how you feel.

183
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:10,080
If it only brings you pain,

184
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,211
don't tell me anything.

185
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,320
I'll just try harder.

186
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,951
If it only brings you pain,

187
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,251
don't tell me anything.

188
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:52,620
I want to protect you too...

189
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,721
as much as you want to protect me.

190
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,630
Ae Ri.

191
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,630
Yes?

192
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:06,171
What would you like for me to tell you?

193
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:11,370
- Mom? - What would you like to know?

194
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,951
Where's Kim Jin Ho?

195
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,211
I need to meet him.

196
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:35,501
It's his phone number. This is all I know.

197
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:36,661
(Kim Jin Ho)

198
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:39,370
You won't be able to reach him at that number though...

199
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:42,001
and he's constantly on the move.

200
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:46,770
However, I know the hospital that his daughter goes to.

201
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:48,981
I asked because...

202
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:51,511
it worried me the most when I heard he was on the move.

203
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,050
He'll be taking his daughter there for regular checkups.

204
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,850
Ae Ri.

205
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,491
Did you find out where Kim Jin Ho is?

206
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,691
Yes, my mom told me the hospital his daughter goes to.

207
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:06,691
- Let's go. - Guys!

208
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,070
I've been calling you guys all the way I was running here.

209
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,701
- Darn, I'm out of breath. - What are you...

210
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,671
Take me with you.

211
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,411
Don't leave me out anymore.

212
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,810
Tell me everything and take me with you.

213
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,550
Darn, that was killer.

214
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,161
Seo Jin moved out of the house last night.

215
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,161
What's going on? Tell me.

216
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:43,330
Kim Seo Jin...

217
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:46,830
knows everything.

218
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,040
- Did you tell him? - No.

219
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,370
Then how did he find out?

220
00:19:58,251 --> 00:19:59,751
This isn't part of the scenario.

221
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:02,951
All our planning was for nothing!

222
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,181
And what exactly was your plan?

223
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,641
Explain.

224
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:33,211
- So it was Lee Taek Gyu. - Explain!

225
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,290
(Republic of Korea, Passport)

226
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:43,820
(Lee Ji Young)

227
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,891
Lee Ji Young.

228
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:47,590
I like names that feel unfamiliar.

229
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:55,040
Kang Hyun Chae... isn't my real name either.

230
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,011
- What are you talking about? - Lee Yoo Na.

231
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:02,011
That was the first name I had.

232
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,951
When I was young, I was always covered in bruises.

233
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,580
My father beat me up every time he got drunk.

234
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:11,590
It's why I got out of there.

235
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,221
I was adopted at the age of 10...

236
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,030
and Kang Hyun Chae has been my name since.

237
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:23,501
I thought I'd live as Kang Hyun Chae forever,

238
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,141
but the filth...

239
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:31,641
that I refuse to call my father came looking for me one day.

240
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:35,711
He threatened me saying he'll expose everything...

241
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,310
how lowly my background is unless I paid up.

242
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,790
Since when?

243
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,120
I was in a bit of a hurry.

244
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:51,491
I wanted to get my revenge and fight against him,

245
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,300
but I can't seem to do that with that jerk.

246
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,270
That's why I asked Mr. Lee for help.

247
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:07,270
Why didn't you tell me about it until now?

248
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,810
You should've told me ages ago.

249
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,850
The one you loved is Kang Hyun Chae.

250
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,020
- What? - Would you have stayed by me...

251
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,590
if I was Lee Yoo Na?

252
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:33,671
We've been together for over 10 years,

253
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,741
yet you still don't know me.

254
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,020
What are you doing? Give me my phone.

255
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,921
Is his name Lee Byung Hak?

256
00:22:58,391 --> 00:22:59,891
What are you going to do?

257
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:06,030
I'll take care of everything.

258
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,701
I'll let you...

259
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:12,171
live with the name you want.

260
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:16,911
He's a complete lunatic.

261
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:18,751
Don't be so rash.

262
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:37,261
(Director Kim Seo Jin)

263
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,141
- Hello? - I have...

264
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,280
what you're looking for.

265
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:55,020
I thought about selling it to Chairman Yu,

266
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,691
but there was no reason for me to let him know that I have it.

267
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,661
Where are you? I'll come and see you now.

268
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,060
Waiting number 33.

269
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,911
The patient's name, please.

270
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:23,711
Could I have the contact of a patient who is getting treated...

271
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:25,310
in the pulmonology department of this hospital?

272
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,651
Her name is Kim Ji Ah, a five-year-old girl.

273
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,691
Why do you ask? What's your relationship with her?

274
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:35,790
Well, we have to get in touch with Ji Ah's father,

275
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,060
but we couldn't reach him. He must have changed his number.

276
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:40,191
So you're just acquaintances.

277
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:43,261
I'm sorry, but I cannot disclose any personal information...

278
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:45,030
to a third party who isn't her family.

279
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,870
Could you help us out?

280
00:24:47,671 --> 00:24:49,770
Think about how desperate we are to be here.

281
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,280
Then at least tell us when Ji Ah will be coming in.

283
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,011
I don't think I can do that either.

284
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:01,181
But you can pass my contact information to him, can't you?

285
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,280
Please tell Ji Ah's guardian...

286
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:06,320
to reach me at this number.

287
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,461
Okay, sure.

288
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:09,991
Thank you.

289
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,661
"Think about how desperate we are to be here."

290
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,830
You're an awesome actress.

291
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,770
- How did you know? - It's so obvious.

292
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,241
If that wasn't the case, why would you two be here?

293
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:27,370
Anyway, is there nothing we can do other than waiting for him to call?

294
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:30,110
We'll have to wait.

295
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,880
I'm sure Mr. Kim should be able to find out when she came in.

296
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,820
Which Mr. Kim?

297
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,891
- What? - Mr. Kim in a month?

298
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,090
Or Mr. Kim right now?

299
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:47,491
Hey.

300
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,300
Do you believe me now?

301
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,201
After you fell asleep yesterday,

302
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:56,870
he called your phone.

303
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:59,211
And you picked it up?

304
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,911
I told him that Ae Ri is asleep and walked out of the hospital room.

305
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:06,610
And I saw Mr. Kim sleeping before my eyes.

306
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:09,050
What's going on?

307
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:16,860
What is it?

308
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,840
You must remember this place too.

309
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,610
Let's discuss that thing you brought first.

310
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,441
If things from a month ago change,

311
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:38,310
this rendezvous will only remain in our memories.

312
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,951
Even so, I won't be changing my decision.

313
00:26:44,151 --> 00:26:46,491
Which one? Your affair?

314
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,261
Destroying my family? Or your betrayal?

315
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,270
I loved Hyun Chae first.

316
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,570
Cut your nonsense and give it to me. Do you even have it?

317
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,671
Tell me how you got it.

318
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:07,540
On the night when Kwak was attacked by a stranger,

319
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,681
at the studio apartment.

320
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,590
- What do you want? - I'm leaving with Hyun Chae. Money.

321
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,991
- How much? - As much as I want.

322
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:28,560
More than enough.

323
00:27:32,471 --> 00:27:34,530
- Does Hyun Chae know? - Not yet.

324
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,671
I'll let her know once you accept my offer.

325
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:42,211
So this was it.

326
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:46,151
This is the offer Hyun Chae made to Chairman Yu.

327
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:49,580
She met with him like a fool when she didn't have it with her.

328
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,921
That's why you couldn't ask him.

329
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:55,060
You knew you might die before you got what you wanted.

330
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,691
That's why you called me.

331
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:03,731
I already know you can't turn this down.

332
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,431
I'll think about it.

333
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:07,401
Are you sure you have enough time?

334
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:09,870
Make it quick.

335
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,810
What made you like this?

336
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,241
You had no idea what kind of a deal she was making...

337
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:18,241
with Chairman Yu.

338
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:22,421
If Hyun Chae got what she wanted from him,

339
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,820
she would've abandoned you and left.

340
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:40,570
Something about you has always bothered me.

341
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,741
Don't pretend like you know it all.

342
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,971
You aren't the only big shot in this world.

343
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:49,481
I'll bet my life...

344
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,981
with someone worthy as I'd like.

345
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,080
You should've lived a better life if you wanted to say that.

346
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,451
You destroyed my family and are threatening me over money.

347
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:00,350
Don't pretend like you're the victim.

348
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,441
(Lee Byung Hak)

349
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,479
Hello?

350
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,519
Who is this?

351
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,660
Do you know Kang Hyun Chae... No.

352
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,090
I mean, Lee Yoo Na?

353
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,100
If you ever try to pull anything with her, I'll kill you.

354
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,110
Save my number. Run out here whenever I call you.

355
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:55,789
- Hello? - You!

356
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,660
Who the heck is this Seo Do Kyun?

357
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:04,360
Do you think I'll let you live after trying to trick me like this?

358
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,969
You brat.

359
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:11,100
If you don't bring me the money you promised to give me,

360
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,969
I'll burn down your house...

361
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,140
and your husband's company just like you did.

362
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,850
I'll turn everything into ashes. Get it?

363
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:22,580
No.

364
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,689
I'll kill Seo Do Kyun first.

365
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,019
Don't.

366
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:29,620
He has nothing to do with me, so don't lay a finger on him!

367
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,660
You can talk to me.

368
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,789
I'll talk to you in person!

369
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:44,056
Mr. Lee, you couldn't have done everything alone.

370
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:49,656
Why did you abduct Ms. Han?

371
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,126
I'm telling you.

372
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:56,297
I choose to remain silent.

373
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:00,737
Your arrest warrant will be granted soon.

374
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:03,537
Then you'll be shut up in a detention center.

375
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:06,047
You're really going to stay quiet?

376
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:12,916
I'm Mr. Lee's attorney.

377
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:19,187
May I have a word with him?

378
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:22,626
Sure, go ahead.

379
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:55,626
I explained everything he'll get...

380
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,957
as long as he sticks to the contract.

381
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:01,666
It looks like he understood.

382
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:04,166
You won't have to worry, Chairman Yu.

383
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,267
There's nothing to worry about if I left my case in your hands.

384
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:09,406
Keep it up to the end.

385
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:41,131
Hello? Mr. Kim.

386
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:42,300
Ms. Han.

387
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,770
I found out where the evidence Mr. Kim brought is.

388
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,171
Seo Do Kyun has it.

389
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,941
Then I'm sure he won't give it back. What should we do?

390
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,210
He had a condition.

391
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,151
- What was it? - He wants everything...

392
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,050
I have.

393
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,251
That's too harsh.

394
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,321
I'm sure we'll find a way.

395
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:09,821
I went to the hospital where Mr. Kim's daughter goes to.

396
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,590
I couldn't see him today,

397
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,531
but I'm sure he'll stop by soon to see her doctor.

398
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,461
I can take it from him at that time.

399
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,001
Could you find out when his daughter came to the hospital?

400
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,740
Yes, I'll find out.

401
00:34:21,941 --> 00:34:24,071
Do you remember how your father's death...

402
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:25,471
was reinvestigated?

403
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:26,611
I do.

404
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,180
I didn't have enough evidence to claim the culprit,

405
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:32,350
but there's someone I was suspicious of.

406
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,481
Then send me everything related to that person.

407
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:36,921
I'll find out if it was my mom's acquaintance.

408
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:38,820
I'm relieved.

409
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,091
Why?

410
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,790
Because you...

411
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,490
haven't given up.

412
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,010
(Kim Seo Jin)

413
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,680
Just think of Da Bin.

414
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:10,421
We've both lost my mom and Da Bin once.

415
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,361
Anyone can lose someone precious in their lives,

416
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,290
but not everyone gets to turn it back.

417
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,331
I didn't know what I was trying to protect...

418
00:35:22,531 --> 00:35:24,701
and had been in confusion for the last few days.

419
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,971
I'll pick myself up again.

420
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,941
Let's just not give up.

421
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:42,480
You're all paid. And this is her prescription.

422
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,350
That's for a month, and you can go to the pharmacy in the hospital.

423
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,621
Yes, thank you.

424
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:47,860
Mr. Kim.

425
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:50,691
Yesterday, someone came by looking for you.

426
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,191
Someone came looking for me?

427
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,630
Yes, she left me her number...

428
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:00,700
She had something to tell you, so she asked you to call her.

429
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
(Han Ae Ri)

430
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:06,341
I see. Thank you.

431
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,390
- Hello? - This is Kim Jin Ho.

432
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:24,660
I've been waiting for you to call.

433
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,061
Your daughter is looking for me. Did you know?

434
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:31,531
She couldn't reach you with your old number,

435
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,070
so I told her the hospital Ji Ah goes to.

436
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,640
To be honest,

437
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,540
I sent a part of the documents...

438
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:42,980
you've sent me to Mr. Kim Seo Jin of Yujung.

439
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,850
I'm not sure how Chairman Yu Seo Il found out about that...

440
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,121
since I've been getting chased.

441
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:55,160
Will you tell your daughter now?

442
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,431
Did you send that file to Mr. Kim as well?

443
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,170
No, I just sent him a part of the paper documents...

444
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,240
that can kindle his suspicion and begin investigating again.

445
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,050
If my daughter wants that file,

446
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,121
give it to her.

447
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:16,990
Are you sure she'll be okay?

448
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
To be honest, I can't be sure.

449
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,760
But I realized I couldn't protect her...

450
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,230
just by holding on to that document.

451
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,441
Yes. Then I'll give her a call.

452
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,810
- Geon Wook. - Hey, you're here.

453
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,451
Did Soo Jung get home safely last night?

454
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:47,990
Yes, and I did my best to do some explaining...

455
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,620
like a good lecturer.

456
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:52,661
It seemed like she understood,

457
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,730
but she also seems confused.

458
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:57,201
It's not easy to accept it as the truth.

459
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,370
I didn't want her to get involved in this.

460
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:04,201
Don't worry about her. She looked a bit excited too.

461
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:10,810
Did Mr. Kim call you last night?

462
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,651
Yes. In October, Seo Do Kyun has that thing.

463
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,321
It won't be easy to get it from him. We have to find it no matter what.

464
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,521
You're right.

465
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:28,730
Hello?

466
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,860
Ms. Han, this is Kim Jin Ho.

467
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,130
Mr. Kim Jin Ho.

468
00:39:11,901 --> 00:39:14,411
(Zolpidem Tartrate)

469
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:30,021
What are you here to say?

470
00:39:55,281 --> 00:39:57,321
Your daughter is visiting you with some pocket money.

471
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,821
Shouldn't you at least offer her a glass of water?

472
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:02,591
Don't be absurd. Go get it yourself.

473
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:32,620
Do you have another glass?

474
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:37,091
Darn it. What a nuisance.

475
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,050
What are you doing?

476
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,021
Are you trying to kill me again?

477
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,521
Do you think you'll get your way again?

478
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,190
Have you gone insane?

479
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:19,901
Do you think you'll get away with killing me?

480
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,831
Let's die together.

481
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:25,000
A scumbag like you should've died long ago!

482
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,201
You little wench.

483
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,351
Are you crazy?

484
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:55,101
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone.

485
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,681
(Hyun Chae)

486
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:12,551
Where are you? Why can't I get hold of you all day?

487
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,301
- Hello? - Mr. Kim.

488
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,541
It's already past my working hours.

489
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,010
When do you think you're coming home?

490
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,110
Is Hyun Chae not there?

491
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,341
No, and she's not picking up.

492
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,250
This has never happened before.

493
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:45,480
I'll be there soon.

494
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,260
(Hyun Chae)

495
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,260
The phone is turned off.

496
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:27,461
Hello.

497
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:29,791
Da Bin just went to bed.

498
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,630
I see. I'm sorry about this.

499
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:34,530
One minute.

500
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,130
Hello? Mr. Im?

501
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,801
Mr. Kim, Ms. Kwak woke up.

502
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,740
I'm on my way.

503
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:48,250
I'm sorry, but something urgent just came up.

504
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:50,280
Could you stay here for a bit longer?

505
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:52,120
I'll pay you for working overtime.

506
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,020
That's okay. If it's urgent, you should go.

507
00:43:55,451 --> 00:43:58,890
Ms. Kang could come home anytime, so I'll stay until then.

508
00:43:59,091 --> 00:44:00,191
Thank you.

509
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:40,801
- I'm fine. You should go home. - It's okay.

510
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,571
Mr. Kim is on his way here.

511
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,441
Hello.

512
00:44:48,971 --> 00:44:50,110
You two can talk.

513
00:44:55,587 --> 00:44:58,217
Are you okay? I'm glad it wasn't anything serious.

514
00:44:59,388 --> 00:45:02,187
About the man who came to the studio apartment...

515
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:04,758
- Yes? - I recognized him.

516
00:45:05,457 --> 00:45:07,158
It was Detective Park Joo Young.

517
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:11,067
Are you talking about the detective who investigated...

518
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,097
Taejung Town's collapse?

519
00:45:13,937 --> 00:45:15,807
Did you know already?

520
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:19,008
His partial fingerprints were found at the site...

521
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,778
where my father passed away.

522
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:25,278
But I couldn't accuse him of anything with that.

523
00:45:25,748 --> 00:45:28,988
I'm certain that he harmed your father.

524
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,258
Because your father, Kim Yoo Seok,

525
00:45:32,957 --> 00:45:36,587
was the sole individual who knew what unforgivable thing...

526
00:45:36,587 --> 00:45:38,358
Yu Seo Il had done.

527
00:45:41,097 --> 00:45:43,427
Your father had found something strange...

528
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:47,268
after looking into the incident.

529
00:45:47,437 --> 00:45:48,707
The sink hole alone...

530
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,608
couldn't have attributed to the collapse.

531
00:45:53,508 --> 00:45:54,947
How did you know about that?

532
00:45:55,077 --> 00:45:57,177
I found out while reinvestigating this case.

533
00:45:57,677 --> 00:46:00,717
But with the documents Mr. Kim had sent me,

534
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:03,417
I couldn't determine the core cause.

535
00:46:04,717 --> 00:46:08,057
Your father is the one who had found out about it.

536
00:46:13,957 --> 00:46:16,368
(The day before the Taejung Town Collapse)

537
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:19,038
Hey, Seo Jin.

538
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:21,368
Father, where are you?

539
00:46:21,908 --> 00:46:23,268
I'm still at work.

540
00:46:23,268 --> 00:46:25,608
I still have some work left, but I'll be home soon.

541
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:27,748
I've already prepared dinner for you.

542
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:29,378
Come home soon so we can eat together.

543
00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:31,648
You should go ahead first.

544
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:33,717
You must be tired from taking the exam all day.

545
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:38,018
Father, I have a good feeling about the exam.

546
00:46:40,158 --> 00:46:42,528
I'll go to a good university and make you proud.

547
00:46:43,488 --> 00:46:45,957
Make me proud? Goodness.

548
00:46:46,128 --> 00:46:48,927
All right. Thanks. I'm hanging up. I'll be home soon.

549
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:56,508
Why is a truck coming at this hour?

550
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,417
- Mr. Lee? - Mr. Kim.

551
00:47:15,388 --> 00:47:16,728
Did you not clock out?

552
00:47:16,927 --> 00:47:18,358
Why are you here at this hour?

553
00:47:18,957 --> 00:47:20,498
We're not expecting any materials at this hour.

554
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:23,567
I was supposed to come tomorrow morning,

555
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:24,868
but I decided to come early.

556
00:47:26,368 --> 00:47:29,008
Gosh, how do you expect me to check all of them at this hour?

557
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:30,337
I have to go home.

558
00:47:30,508 --> 00:47:34,177
You can check tomorrow morning. It's too dark now.

559
00:47:35,378 --> 00:47:37,248
I'll make sure to close down before I leave.

560
00:47:37,717 --> 00:47:38,817
You should go home first.

561
00:47:39,447 --> 00:47:40,717
Goodness.

562
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:44,358
All right. Thanks.

563
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:47,158
- No problem. - And stop drinking so much.

564
00:47:48,128 --> 00:47:49,628
- Okay. - Bye.

565
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:57,667
A mysterious truck had entered the construction site...

566
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,638
the night before the collapse.

567
00:48:04,038 --> 00:48:06,238
In the truck,

568
00:48:08,947 --> 00:48:11,148
there were hefty amounts of explosives.

569
00:48:17,817 --> 00:48:19,018
Your father had met with Yu Seo Il...

570
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:21,388
and made him confess.

571
00:48:22,087 --> 00:48:26,728
The day before he died, he gave that file to me.

572
00:48:28,597 --> 00:48:32,067
We can only catch Chairman Yu if we have that file.

573
00:48:37,008 --> 00:48:38,638
Good girl.

574
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:43,207
You even take your medication well.

575
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:49,047
Dad, until when do I need to take my medication?

576
00:48:51,687 --> 00:48:52,858
I promise...

577
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:56,028
you won't be taking it anymore.

578
00:48:57,358 --> 00:48:58,758
So go to bed.

579
00:49:00,057 --> 00:49:01,268
All right.

580
00:49:02,268 --> 00:49:03,297
This is yours.

581
00:49:23,648 --> 00:49:24,858
Who is it?

582
00:49:39,597 --> 00:49:40,797
Ms. Han?

583
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:46,108
Who are you?

584
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:13,768
Is this the right neighbourhood?

585
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:15,837
I think so.

586
00:50:17,408 --> 00:50:18,638
Try calling him.

587
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:32,057
He's not answering.

588
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:33,387
No?

589
00:50:41,468 --> 00:50:43,297
I texted him to let him know we are almost there.

590
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:46,468
Will he hand it over to us at his place?

591
00:50:46,698 --> 00:50:48,307
He must have placed it elsewhere.

592
00:50:48,407 --> 00:50:49,768
He'll take us to where it is.

593
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:52,107
Gosh.

594
00:51:02,347 --> 00:51:03,387
Excuse me.

595
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:10,258
I'm sorry, but do you know where 330-29 is?

596
00:51:16,097 --> 00:51:17,297
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

597
00:51:19,968 --> 00:51:21,607
I think this is the place.

598
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:23,337
- Really? - Yes.

599
00:51:39,157 --> 00:51:40,288
Mr. Kim?

600
00:51:44,288 --> 00:51:46,557
Mr. Kim, please wake up.

601
00:51:48,127 --> 00:51:50,297
Mr. Kim? Call an ambulance.

602
00:51:50,297 --> 00:51:51,297
Got it.

603
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:55,567
- Mr. Kim! - Hello? Please send an ambulance.

604
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:57,508
A man is unconscious. The address?

605
00:51:57,508 --> 00:51:58,807
- Darn it. - It's 330.

606
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:01,307
It's 330-29, Gonam-dong.

607
00:52:02,107 --> 00:52:03,248
He's not breathing.

608
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:04,748
- Mr. Kim? - Mr. Kim!

609
00:52:05,877 --> 00:52:07,847
Mr. Kim, please wake up.

610
00:52:37,178 --> 00:52:38,647
What now?

611
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:43,018
I'm going to hand this to Kim Seo Jin.

612
00:53:13,577 --> 00:53:14,788
Is she asleep?

613
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:18,117
The nurse asked for a contact number,

614
00:53:18,117 --> 00:53:21,157
so I wrote down yours for now.

615
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:22,357
Good.

616
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:47,778
(Han Ae Ri)

617
00:53:57,327 --> 00:53:59,597
- Mr. Kim. - How did it go?

618
00:53:59,597 --> 00:54:01,297
Did you meet up with Kim Jin Ho?

619
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:03,897
He's in a coma right now.

620
00:54:05,097 --> 00:54:08,067
I went to his house to collect the package,

621
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:09,968
but once I got there,

622
00:54:10,938 --> 00:54:13,377
he was lying unconscious...

623
00:54:13,377 --> 00:54:14,807
with a plastic bag wrapped around his head.

624
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:22,018
Did you retrieve the package he had?

625
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:23,948
No.

626
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,157
Unless he regains unconsciousness,

627
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:30,528
there's no way for me to get it in my timeline.

628
00:54:31,258 --> 00:54:32,357
What now?

629
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:36,528
Just a second.

630
00:54:37,827 --> 00:54:42,567
(Park Joo Young)

631
00:54:48,547 --> 00:54:49,678
What's this?

632
00:54:49,678 --> 00:54:51,748
I see you received the text. That's him.

633
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:54,448
The man who I suspect as my father's killer.

634
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:56,748
I think...

635
00:54:58,018 --> 00:54:59,458
I saw him.

636
00:55:01,857 --> 00:55:04,657
In front of Kim Jin Ho's house.

637
00:55:15,637 --> 00:55:17,938
Once again, all roads lead to Chairman Yu.

638
00:55:18,577 --> 00:55:20,907
With Lee Taek Gyu gone, he turned to Park Joo Young.

639
00:55:20,907 --> 00:55:23,847
If Park Joo Young is taken out of the picture,

640
00:55:25,248 --> 00:55:26,817
he'll hire someone else.

641
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:45,597
What on earth is going on?

642
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:56,248
(Seo Do Kyun)

643
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,438
(Hyun Chae)

644
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:08,077
Hyun Chae, why weren't you picking up?

645
00:58:08,077 --> 00:58:09,347
- I was worried sick... - Help.

646
00:58:13,647 --> 00:58:15,418
Please come and save me.

647
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:17,288
Where are you right now?

648
00:58:22,857 --> 00:58:24,587
I just texted you the address.

649
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:43,448
Hurry. Save me, please.

650
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:46,248
Hurry. Please hurry.

651
00:58:46,248 --> 00:58:48,617
Please. Come quick!

652
00:58:48,617 --> 00:58:49,688
Darn you!

653
00:58:51,087 --> 00:58:52,188
Hyun Chae?

654
00:58:54,857 --> 00:58:57,288
Hyun Chae? Hyun Chae!

655
00:58:57,288 --> 00:59:00,127
Take that. Take that, you cow!

656
00:59:00,797 --> 00:59:03,597
You darn brat. You...

657
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,538
Get over here!

658
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:07,797
You wench!

659
00:59:10,468 --> 00:59:13,137
Ms. Han, I'm off to find Kim Jin Ho.

660
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,047
A month has passed,

661
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:17,678
so he might have regained consciousness.

662
00:59:18,147 --> 00:59:20,847
I'll head to the prosecution once I retrieve the package.

663
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:52,077
What... on earth are you doing?

664
00:59:52,077 --> 00:59:54,248
Isn't it obvious, you wench?

665
00:59:54,478 --> 00:59:56,918
You should get a taste of your own medicine.

666
00:59:58,488 --> 01:00:01,488
I was wrong!

667
01:00:01,857 --> 01:00:04,587
I'll give you whatever you want! So please...

668
01:00:04,587 --> 01:00:06,528
I can't believe...

669
01:00:06,897 --> 01:00:10,268
I trusted a swindler like you and waited all this time!

670
01:00:10,528 --> 01:00:13,038
Let's put an end to our ill-fated relationship!

671
01:00:13,397 --> 01:00:14,668
I promise to give you the money.

672
01:00:15,107 --> 01:00:16,107
Please don't do this.

673
01:00:16,168 --> 01:00:17,807
- I'll give you more money! - Darn it!

674
01:00:28,418 --> 01:00:30,518
Come out. Come out, you scumbag!

675
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:32,387
Let me go, you jerk!

676
01:00:33,288 --> 01:00:34,387
Let me go!

677
01:00:48,337 --> 01:00:49,468
Die.

678
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:53,278
Die!

679
01:01:15,728 --> 01:01:17,867
Hyun Chae.

680
01:01:19,337 --> 01:01:20,567
Hyun Chae, please...

681
01:01:21,397 --> 01:01:23,607
Please... Open your eyes.

682
01:01:24,107 --> 01:01:25,137
Please...

683
01:01:29,508 --> 01:01:31,478
Please... Don't do this to me.

684
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:43,458
Hang in there.

685
01:01:58,807 --> 01:01:59,837
You...

686
01:02:04,107 --> 01:02:06,147
Where... Where do you think you're going?

687
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:09,188
Come here! You!

688
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:13,087
Where are you going?

689
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:19,758
Come here, you wench! Come back here!

690
01:02:19,797 --> 01:02:21,198
Go!

691
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,688
He was already suffering from an illness,

692
01:02:45,817 --> 01:02:47,087
and he suffered serious brain damage...

693
01:02:47,087 --> 01:02:48,758
due to something that happened a month ago.

694
01:02:49,528 --> 01:02:52,627
At this rate, I can't guarantee that he can fully recover.

695
01:02:58,168 --> 01:02:59,998
(Mr. Park Ho Young)

696
01:03:00,668 --> 01:03:01,807
Hello?

697
01:03:38,938 --> 01:03:40,877
Can I speak to you for a minute?

698
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:42,278
Sure.

699
01:03:42,907 --> 01:03:44,708
When we got here after receiving your wife's call,

700
01:03:45,107 --> 01:03:46,377
Mr. Seo Do Kyun and Mr. Lee Byung Hak...

701
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:47,518
had already passed away.

702
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,488
What is your wife's relationship...

703
01:03:52,488 --> 01:03:53,518
with those two men?

704
01:04:18,448 --> 01:04:19,617
Mr. Kim.

705
01:04:21,647 --> 01:04:23,788
Were you aware of the relationship between your wife...

706
01:04:25,117 --> 01:04:26,317
and Mr. Seo?

707
01:04:29,928 --> 01:04:31,028
Yes.

708
01:04:33,897 --> 01:04:35,228
Go home for now.

709
01:04:35,597 --> 01:04:37,228
We'll interrogate your wife first.

710
01:04:37,567 --> 01:04:39,998
If we need your help, we'll call you then.

711
01:04:44,307 --> 01:04:46,837
Thankfully, the doctor said...

712
01:04:46,978 --> 01:04:48,778
your wife was okay.

713
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,018
She'll come here after receiving first aid.

714
01:05:18,637 --> 01:05:21,208
- Ms. Kang? - Yes?

715
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:23,748
Your real name is Lee Yoo Na,

716
01:05:23,748 --> 01:05:24,978
and your father's name is Lee Byung Hak.

717
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:27,877
The man who passed away today is your father, correct?

718
01:05:30,188 --> 01:05:31,188
Yes.

719
01:05:31,988 --> 01:05:33,857
What was your relationship with Mr. Seo?

720
01:07:37,577 --> 01:07:40,918
(I love you.)

721
01:07:48,088 --> 01:07:49,288
I'm sorry.

722
01:07:52,257 --> 01:07:53,398
Do Kyun...

723
01:07:55,128 --> 01:07:56,467
Do Kyun...

724
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,838
Hello, Mr. Im.

725
01:08:40,878 --> 01:08:43,208
Mr. Kim. Kim Jin Ho is awake.

726
01:08:44,608 --> 01:08:47,648
He moved his fingers. We have hope.

727
01:09:18,777 --> 01:09:20,318
Mr. Kim.

728
01:09:21,577 --> 01:09:24,548
I believe that you can hear me.

729
01:09:25,318 --> 01:09:26,757
I remember how you came to our lobby...

730
01:09:27,617 --> 01:09:30,858
and tried so hard to save your daughter.

731
01:09:35,257 --> 01:09:37,467
I don't know where you hid it,

732
01:09:38,628 --> 01:09:41,367
but I doubt it's more precious than your one and only daughter.

733
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:47,708
If you want to save her, you better get up.

734
01:09:50,277 --> 01:09:52,648
Give it some thought while you're lying there.

735
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:56,918
Think about who you must side with to save yourself.

736
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:18,407
(Kairos)

737
01:10:18,668 --> 01:10:22,378
(Kairos)

738
01:10:30,947 --> 01:10:33,487
(Kairos)

739
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:38,027
I'll pack my stuff and leave soon.

740
01:10:38,628 --> 01:10:40,097
Let's say you found out...

741
01:10:40,097 --> 01:10:41,557
that the future holds an unfavourable outcome.

742
01:10:41,557 --> 01:10:43,268
Would you make a different choice then?

743
01:10:44,628 --> 01:10:45,938
Mr. Kim, please wake up.

744
01:10:45,938 --> 01:10:48,038
Do you remember where you placed the package?

745
01:10:48,038 --> 01:10:49,237
What did you just say?

746
01:10:49,237 --> 01:10:51,338
I saw everything.

747
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:52,907
I'm here to collect something.

748
01:10:52,907 --> 01:10:55,077
The file and flash drive, right?

749
01:10:55,307 --> 01:10:57,548
This is now our last chance.

750
01:10:57,608 --> 01:10:59,878
I will now meet with Chairman Yu.

751
01:11:01,217 --> 01:11:03,088
The package you're after...

752
01:11:03,088 --> 01:11:04,248
is in my possession.
