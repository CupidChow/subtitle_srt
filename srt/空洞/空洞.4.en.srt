Don't tell me that you killed my daughter.

8
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:29,916

10

11

Yes, it's him.

14
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:43,296
He came to see my mom at the hospital.

15

16
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:46,966

18

He has been wanted for the murder he committed a month ago.

19

Are you sure that he killed Ms. Han?

20
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,375
Ms. Han, don't go looking for Kim Jin Ho. You mustn't.

Anyway, is Ae Ri in the restroom?

26
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:33,306
She got off early. She had to go somewhere.

Hey, why aren't you saying anything?

125
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,615
Just read the texts he sent you.

126
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,754
Doesn't that nonsense raise a red flag?

127
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:13,784

Yes, Kim Jin Ho.

144

00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:15,685
No, that wasn't Kim Jin Ho.

147

153
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:39,034
because I think he's involved in my mom's disappearance.

154
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,774
He came to see her on the day she disappeared.

155
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:47,475
So I went there to see what he knows, but...

156
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,884
Then why did that guy chase after us hungry for blood?

157
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,685

159
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:57,924

Why did he want me dead?

161
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:04,225

201
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:29,665
I know it took courage to come to my office,

202
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:31,504
so I apologize for kicking you out.

203
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,604
Please tell me you weren't hurt in any way.

204
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:37,774
I'm also sorry...

205
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,574
that you got involved with someone like me,

206
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,114
which only resulted in being humiliated.

207
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:47,185
I know things are rough, but please don't give up on me.

208
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,324
Don't give up on my daughter.

209
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:52,625
I'll do my best to locate your mother as well...

210
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,794
by all means necessary.

211
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,564

Please leave a message after the tone.

213
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:09,875
I survived last night thanks to you.

214
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,574
You'll only get this message late in the evening,

215
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,114
but I'm leaving it in case you're worried.

216
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:22,054
I've also experienced a loss of a family member.

217
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:25,554
I never got around to asking my mom the details,

218
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,465
but my dad passed away when I was young.

219
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:36,135
Dad, where are you?

220
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:39,304
Because you're not here,

221
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:43,475
mom won't eat. All she does is cry.

222
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,375
Dad, please come home soon.

223
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:52,814
Moving to a new neighbourhood...

224
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:54,854
and having my mom suffer from heart disease...

225
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:57,485
led to me spending most of my time alone.

226
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:01,524
But whenever I was happy or sad,

227
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:04,725
I'd call my dad's number to leave a message.

228
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:11,504
Dad, it's me, Ae Ri. I graduated from school today.

229
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,304
I'm no longer in elementary school.

230
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,774
When I begin middle school, I'll be wearing a school uniform.

231
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,715
The one I'll be wearing is really pretty.

232
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,215
But it's a little pricey though.

233
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,655
That'll be 10.8 dollars.

234
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,625
- My dad's voice... - One signature, one bulgogi.

235
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,584
and his face slowly faded away.

236
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:33,225
- But... - Let me take your order.

237
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:35,324
Just leaving a message on his phone...

238
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:38,264
about the day I had brought great comfort.

239
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:39,465
Dad,

240
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:42,804
I'll be going to university soon.

241
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:45,705
I bet you're happy for me.

242
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,205
It's not the best university in Korea,

243
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:54,014
but I chose the one that offered me a scholarship.

244
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,485
I'll study hard, get a decent job,

245
00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:58,415
and earn enough to fix mom's condition.

246
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,985
No one in my class this year earned as much as I did.

247
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:04,655
Just you wait and see.

248
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,354
I'll earn all the money in this world.

249
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,054
The world will be mine!

250
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,794
The cellphone number we're communicating through...

251
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:16,435
used to belong to my dad.

252
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:21,034
I've been leaving messages on it for someone who'd never hear them.

253
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,804
But now that has all changed.

254
00:22:23,804 --> 00:22:25,614
(1 new voicemail)

255
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:28,114
I, too,

256
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:31,445
wondered why it was me...

257
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:34,985
who got involved with you.

258
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:41,594
Maybe it's because this is for both our sakes.

259
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,495
It's not just me helping you out.

260
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,405
I must know why Kim Jin Ho met with my mom.

261
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:58,475
A man I couldn't identify was at his house last night.

262
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:02,245
I threw something at him while running away,

263
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:04,145
and it scratched his face a little.

264
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:08,514
If he had gotten his hands on me, I would've died.

265
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,625
Who could he be...

266
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:13,354
and why did Kim Jin Ho want to kill me?

267
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:17,794
If you find out anything from your timeline,

268
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:20,034
please let me know.

269
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:25,534
Your voice mail has been recorded.

270
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,445
When will we have the forensics report?

271
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,344
They said they'll have it by tomorrow. I'll check again.

272
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:34,814
Try to rush them.

273
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:43,385
Mr. Kim.

274
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:46,054
Mr. Park.

275
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,465
I have something to say to Mr. Kim Jin Ho.

276
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,735
There's no need to see him. It'll only break your heart.

277
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:56,235
I want to see him once again before he gets sent to a detention center.

278
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:59,034
Not as a victim and a culprit,

279
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,705
but as a father to another father,

280
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:04,844
I have something to say to him.

281
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:08,945
Mr. Kim.

282
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:13,685
I came to say something to you.

283
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:16,625
What can you say at this point?

284
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,625
It's long overdue, but I'm sorry.

285
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:23,094
I should've listened to what you had to say much earlier.

286
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:26,395
But my arrogance put it off...

287
00:24:28,804 --> 00:24:30,135
until it's too late.

288
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:33,274
Before you blew up with anger,

289
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:38,504
I should've considered how much pain you and Ji Soo would've been in.

290
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:45,955
I think I finally realized...

291
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:51,125
how you felt to have protested in front of our office...

292
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:54,695
only after I lost my own child.

293
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:05,504
It's already too late.

294
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:14,245
I wanted to tell you that...

295
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,014
before you get sent away.

296
00:25:20,754 --> 00:25:21,854
But...

297
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:26,925
why did you kill Ms. Han Ae Ri?

298
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:35,135
You killed Han Ae Ri, didn't you?

299
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:37,935
Han Ae Ri?

300
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,274
The woman from a month ago?

301
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,044
No, I didn't kill her.

302
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:52,885
She went to see you. Is that why you killed her?

303
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:56,824
No. I just saw her for a moment. That's all.

304
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:59,324
- I mean it. - What did you do the day after...

305
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,425
Han Ae Ri came to see you?

306
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:04,195
Well, I... On that day...

307
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:08,935
My second daughter suddenly wasn't doing so well,

308
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,264
so I was at the hospital.

309
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:13,975
I... I don't know what happened to Han Ae Ri. I mean it.

310
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:16,804
Mr. Kim, what are you doing? Come on out.

311
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,574
Come out.

312
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,445
Come out.

313
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,044
(Lobby, Reception)

314
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,185
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

315
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:00,814
(A General Ward)

316
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:02,225
On August 24?

317
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:06,455
Ji Ah got a tracheotomy on that day,

318
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:09,995
so her father was at the hospital since the morning.

319
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:32,254
(Name: Kim Ji Ah, female, 5 years old)

320
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:47,834
Ms. Han, are you all right?

321
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:51,864
I hope you're safe and that you get to listen to this message.

322
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:58,975
It seems like the one who tried to kill you wasn't Kim Jin Ho.

323
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:02,385
I visited the hospital where his second daughter is hospitalized.

324
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,385
She was desperately in need of her guardian,

325
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,685
so I have no idea why he did something that reckless.

326
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:16,094
I looked through my mom's belongings,

327
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:18,125
but I haven't found anything in particular yet.

328
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:24,804
(August 6, grocery shopping, August 7, Ae Ri's birthday)

329
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:33,114
She had a habit of writing down everything,

330
00:28:33,274 --> 00:28:36,614
but she didn't leave anything regarding Kim Jin Ho.

331
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:39,455
It seems like Kim Jin Ho had been...

332
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,655
piling up his anger for Yujung for much longer than I expected.

333
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:47,425
I'm sure his anger exploded on me thinking I was the man in charge.

334
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,965
("Did the Illegal Materials Worsen the Situation?")

335
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:50,395
I'll look for something...

336
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,264
that's related to your mother in Kim Jin Ho's history.

337
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:57,965
My daughter's abductor has met your mother.

338
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:00,235
This can't be a coincidence.

339
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:04,245
Kwak Song Ja.

340
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:08,915
There has to be some kind of connection.

341
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:37,375
Is that a phone number?

342
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,435
It wasn't Kim Jin Ho who was at the studio.

343
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:03,205
There had to be someone else.

344
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:10,645

348
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,665
Yes, how may I help you?

349
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:33,735
This is a confiscation warrant.

350
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:36,104
- Get started. - Yes, sir.

351
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:41,375
Get in here.

352
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:09,534
This is Yujung Constructions. How may I help you?

353
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:12,534
Hello. By any chance,

354
00:31:14,135 --> 00:31:17,604
could I find out which department this number was transferred to?

355
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:21,014
I'm sorry. We do not leave such records.

356
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:24,245
I understand.

357
00:31:32,054 --> 00:31:34,294
Mr. Kim, my mom called...

358
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,695
Yujung Constructions.

359
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,165
I'm not sure whom she talked to,

360
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:44,935
but it seems like her connection to Kim Jin Ho is...

361
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,875
Yujung Constructions.

362
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:52,344
(Part 2 will air soon.)

363
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:05,990
Why do I have to be questioned by the prosecution?

364
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,199
A civic group has filed an accusation...

365
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,670
of the use of illegal materials at the amusement complex you built.

366
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,569
Please check and see if these materials were used...

367
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:15,839
during the construction.

368
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,209
These materials weren't illegal.

369
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:21,610
These all passed performance tests.

370
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,979
You should look at the test report first.

371
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,720
They might have approved those without actually conducting tests,

372
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,919
or you could've used a different type of material,

373
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,589
and then forge the document for the test...

374
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,360
to request the approval of the materials.

375
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,189
Then shouldn't you hold that organization responsible?

376
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,489
Why would they do that if they didn't get anything?

377
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,570
Prosecutor, where's my phone?

378
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,530
It's undergoing digital forensics.

379
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,540
I recently got that phone, so there's nothing much on it.

380
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,199
Give it back to me once you're done copying the data.

381
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,540
Just wait.

382
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,469
Car number 240B1847 just has entered the front gate.

383
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:35,079
The meeting is at 10am, so I'll see you at 8am.

384
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,119
- Yes, sir. - Mr. Kim!

385
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,820
You may leave.

386
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,600
I guess you have a guest.

387
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,649
My name is Han Ae Ri. We've met before at your office.

388
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,109
How did you know I live here?

389
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:10,220
Please. Please stop Kim Jin Ho.

390
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,549
Kim Jin Ho will kidnap Da Bin,

391
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,359
and you'll also lose your wife because of the shock.

392
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:16,590
Why do you continue to say such nonsense?

393
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:17,959
Honey.

394
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,229
Honey, you should go inside.

395
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:24,199
Something dreadful will happen to your wife and Da Bin.

396
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,699
- Will you please listen to me? - I said, you can go inside.

397
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,109
You can go inside for now. Okay?

398
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,190
I don't care if you think I'm a mental patient.

399
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,260
I understand very well that what I said sounds insane.

400
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,859
But if you ignore my warning now,

401
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,359
you'll pay a huge price later on.

402
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,699
It doesn't matter if Kim Jin Ho's claim...

403
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,600
that you used illegal materials is true or not.

404
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:01,799
Kim Jin Ho thinks his daughter died because of you.

405
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,940
So he's coming up with a plan to kidnap Da Bin.

406
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,209
You don't have much time left.

407
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,280
You're the only one who can change his mind.

408
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,049
Please.

409
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,250
Please meet him.

410
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,690
Are you finished?

411
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,000
You don't believe me, do you?

412
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,669
It's not like I'm asking you for money!

413
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,399
Is it that hard to meet Kim Jin Ho just once?

414
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:38,139
You should just ask for money instead.

415
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,739
That woman from yesterday came back.

416
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:08,970
She met with Mr. Kim.

417
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,539
I couldn't hear their conversation.

418
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:13,839
Yes.

419
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,849
Who was she? And what's she saying?

420
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,589
You don't have to mind her. She's insane.

421
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,889
How can I not mind her? It's too horrifying to ignore.

422
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,630
Did you call the police?

423
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,159
That'll blow this up even more.

424
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,560
And it'll ruin the company's reputation.

425
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,199
It's best to ignore such nonsense.

426
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,670
Then how did she know Da Bin's name?

427
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,940
There are lots of information online once people search for our names.

428
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,079
You do a number of interviews whenever you hold a charity concert.

429
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,579
It still made my heart shudder...

430
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,349
when I heard Da Bin's name from a strange woman.

431
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,719
Have you seen her somewhere before?

432
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,789
No, I've never seen her before.

433
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,800
Where's Da Bin?

434
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:11,130
She came back from her kindergarten and then fell asleep.

435
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:15,639
Make sure Da Bin isn't approached by strangers for a while.

436
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,870
What you just said makes me really nervous.

437
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,510
- Dad. - Hey, my girl.

438
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,079
Were you asleep?

439
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,699
Is this Manager Seo Do Kyun?

440
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,630
Who is this?

441
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,170
I called regarding Mr. Kim Jin Ho.

442
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,010
Now, let's move on to the payment for the materials.

443
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,219
That's the invoice, the agreement,

444
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,719
and the actual payment.

445
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,050
Please check the list.

446
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,329
Will you please listen to me?

447
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:18,800
Honey.

448
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:22,469
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

449
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,969
I understand very well that what I said sounds insane.

450
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,810
But if you ignore my warning now,

451
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,810
you'll pay a huge price later on.

452
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,980
It doesn't matter if Kim Jin Ho's claim...

453
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,610
that you used illegal materials is true or not.

454
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,779
Kim Jin Ho thinks...

455
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,180
- his daughter died because of you. - Dad. Dad?

456
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:44,829
What's wrong? Are you leaving again?

457
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:45,959
Yes, I'll be late.

458
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,399
- Where are you going? - To my office.

459
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,370
I did go back to my office back then.

460
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:54,039
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

461
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,070
Yes, I'm fine.

462
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,219
Mr. Seo, you're still here?

463
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,389
Are you leaving now?

464
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,149
Why do you work so hard all the time?

465
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,829
I ran a little late after I worked outside the office.

466
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:20,459
Anyway, isn't Mr. Kim a bit too harsh on you?

467
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:22,399
No way. We're a pretty great team.

468
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,469
Well, figures. You're both smart and diligent.

469
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:27,699
Wait, was that a compliment?

470
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,940
Of course. It's much better than someone who's stupid and diligent.

471
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,079
I learn a lot from Mr. Kim.

472
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,550
- Goodbye, then. - Yes, sir. Goodbye.

473
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,329
Over here.

474
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:07,380
Have we met before?

475
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,409
Shortly, while Mr. Kim Jin Ho was protesting alone at your company.

476
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,949
How did you know my number?

477
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,149
I picked up the name card you gave Mr. Kim.

478
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:21,060
You have a weak leg. Should I call a cab?

479
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:24,829
(Manager Seo Do Kyun, Housing Business Department)

480
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,760
I met you only for a moment,

481
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:32,399
but I called because I thought...

482
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:35,169
you could probably persuade Mr. Kim Jin Ho.

483
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:40,340
What do you mean, persuading Mr. Kim?

484
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,539
To be honest,

485
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,250
it's for Mr. Kim Seo Jin, not for Mr. Kim Jin Ho.

486
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,590
You mean, Mr. Kim, our director?

487
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:51,990
Mr. Kim Jin Ho holds...

488
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,819
a deep grudge against the director and Yujung Constructions.

489
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:56,289
I'm sure you're aware of that.

490
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,289
Please go on.

491
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,899
If you let this go on, you might see an awful tragedy.

492
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:05,169
For example, Kim Jin Ho might try to hurt...

493
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:07,769
Mr. Kim Seo Jin's child out of spite.

494
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:13,569
Anyway, if you don't take care of Mr. Kim Jin Ho now,

495
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:17,149
he'll cause horrible damage to Mr. Kim Seo Jin's family,

496
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,350
and the company will also suffer greatly.

497
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,850
I know this may sound absurd...

498
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,419
No, it doesn't sound absurd.

499
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:27,720
I understand what you mean.

500
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,760
Really?

501
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,799
We do not take Mr. Kim Jin Ho's complaint lightly.

502
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:38,230
We've re-examined the materials in question,

503
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,240
and they've passed the tests, so we've closed the case.

504
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:45,039
Even if that's so, we'll still do our best...

505
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:47,980
to comfort Mr. Kim Jin Ho in his personal tragedy.

506
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,809
In any case, he's our customer.

507
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,220
Is that all?

508
00:41:58,149 --> 00:41:59,350
If it is, I should go now.

509
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:03,289
Da Bin will be kidnapped...

510
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,789
by Kim Jin Ho.

511
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,100
That's exactly why you should meet with him to prevent that.

512
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:18,240
If that's true, why did you come to see me?

513
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,110
You should've reported this to the police.

514
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,880
It's probably because you have no proof to back your claim.

515
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,580
Why should I believe something...

516
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,490
that even the police won't?

517
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,960
I was...

518
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,130
I was just desperate.

519
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:48,399
That was too harsh. I'm sorry.

520
00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:53,569
I'll do my best to come to an agreement with Mr. Kim.

521
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,309
I give you my word.

522
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:58,980
Do you have a business card?

523
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:01,049
No, I don't.

524
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,179
Then I'll call this number...

525
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,990
if I ever need your help.

526
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:07,289
What's your name again?

527
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,220
Han Ae Ri.

528
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:11,929
Ms. Han Ae Ri.

529
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,069
Thank you for today. I'll be in touch.

530
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:49,559
(240B1847)

531
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,200
(To be demolished)

532
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:30,159
I want to talk about the fire test and the component test results...

533

They were conducted by a private institution.

535
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,169

542

Hello, sir. This is Kim Seo Jin from Yujung Constructions.

543
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:09,340
I'd like to request an additional test.

544
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,539
We forgot something.

545
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:13,909

Here.

551
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:44,510
Mr. Seo, it's me.

552
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:04,189
- Mom! - My goodness.

553
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,559
Hey, have you not been cleaning?

554
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:11,970
I thought a burglar broke in, and I almost called the cops.

555
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,139
Do you know how many hours I've been cleaning?

556
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,740
You shouldn't have.

557
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:20,139
I was looking for something.

558
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,480
Where have you been all day?

559
00:47:29,419 --> 00:47:30,549
Hey, look at this.

560
00:47:30,919 --> 00:47:32,789
While cleaning, I found a photo of us...

561
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:33,819
when we were students.

562
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:36,889
I couldn't bear to look at them.

563
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,990
Hey, check this out.

564
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,830
Don't we look so tacky?

565
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:44,500
Don't we?

566
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,600
Hey.

567
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,409
What's wrong?

568
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:59,610
It's nothing. I'm just tired.

569
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,350
Which photo was it?

570
00:48:05,689 --> 00:48:06,720
Look at this.

571
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,960
I should've used that field trip money...

572
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,830
on rhinoplasty.

573
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,659
But my mom caught me.

574
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:17,429
Don't tell me you're the one who told her.

575
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:19,230
What are you saying?

576
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:24,000
You were the only one who knew about my perfect plan.

577
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,939
You better spill if you're hiding anything from me.

578
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,880
I've never kept secrets from you.

579
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,950
That's true.

580
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:48,200
Your mom was so beautiful.

581
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,429
Look at her skin.

582
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,870
You need to be thankful.

583
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,799
You have her skin.

584
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,440
What if she's sick?

585
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,779
What if she faints and no one's there?

586
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,119
No. That won't happen.

587
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,390
I'm certain she's somewhere safe.

588
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,760
Soo Jung.

589
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,670
Do you think she abandoned me?

590
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:27,900
Don't be absurd.

591
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:31,569
What kind of mom abandons her own child?

592
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,069
Right?

593
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,379
- She probably misses me, right? - You bet.

594
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:40,950
Do you know why...

595
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,480
there's no word for a parent who has lost their child?

596
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,819
An orphan is someone who has lost their parents.

597
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,859
A widow or a widower is someone who has lost their spouse.

598
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,029
But there's no word for a parent who has lost their child...

599
00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:01,170
because the sadness they feel is beyond explicable.

600
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,710
A mom can never let go of her child.

601
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:20,920
Go to my study and find some documents.

602

It's regarding the materials used for the amusement complex.

603
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,390
Then wouldn't the prosecution have them?

604
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,160
I don't remember exactly where I put them.

605
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:31,859
They must be there.

606
00:51:32,129 --> 00:51:34,190
Find and bring them to the public prosecutors' office.

607
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,309
Yes?

608
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:52,279
I made a brief stop at Director Kim's house.

609
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,920

You called for me, sir?

623
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,039
You're here, Mr. Seo.

624
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:03,519
I heard that the prosecution arrested Seo Jin.

625
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,589
Well, a civic group is suing him regarding the incident,

626
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:09,920
so the prosecution has begun its investigation.

627
00:53:12,129 --> 00:53:13,789
Seo Jin has a lot of enemies, doesn't he?

628
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,730
Life has taught me...

629
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,829
how the people in this world think.

630

Those above them on the ladder...

631
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,069
seem to have gotten there through unlawful means.

632
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:29,180
And those below them...

633
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,210
are stuck there because they don't try hard enough.

634
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:36,180
Is that how you think too?

635
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:38,920
Sorry?

636
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,359
Do you believe that Seo Jin earned his position by being dishonest?

637
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,260
What about you then?

638
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,629
Are you a lazy fellow who doesn't try hard enough?

639
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:52,430
No, sir. Of course not.

640
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:55,970
I'm saying this because we seem to be...

641
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:59,369
the only ones at this office who are on his side.

642
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:04,849
He trusts no one in this world but himself,

643
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,410
but still he relies on you in a certain way.

644
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,220
I'm sure he's suffering immensely at the moment.

645
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:15,089
It's times like this that he needs help.

646
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,690
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

647
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:22,160
Also, tell him not to worry too much about the prosecution.

648
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,599

00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:26,000

- That one? - Yes.

656

The test report you requested has been issued.

663
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,990
It seems urgent, so why don't I send it via fax?

664
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,619

Can you get me Mr. Kim's phone?

674
00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:11,559
Listen to who he talks to...

You still found nothing?

681
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:29,910
The prosecution already ransacked the place,

682
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,480
and there was nothing that looked like a report.

687
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,430
Give me that.

688
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,109
The chairman said...

689
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:07,049
that even though you trust nobody,

690
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,250
you still rely on me in a certain way.

691
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,890
Is that what you think as well?

692
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,950
Your death has been pushed back one day.

693
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:42,049

At unit 609 of a studio apartment in Yeoksam-dong,

695
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,920
you will be found dead.

Is this what you call trust?

711
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,109

01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,579
Give me a minute!

714
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,410
I don't want to meet a useless death...

715
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:25,650
like your father did.

716
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,109
Don't you dare touch my daughter.

717
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,480
She knows nothing!

718
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,650
He's the man who chased me from Kim Jin Ho's place.

719
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,220
You didn't do it single handedly.

720
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:35,190
What's your relationship with my secretary, Lee Taek Gyu?

721
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,559
Ms. Kwak Song Ja? I'm from Yujung Constructions.

722
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:39,990
If you tell me the truth, I will help you.

723
01:02:40,129 --> 01:02:41,559
I swear on Da Bin's life.
