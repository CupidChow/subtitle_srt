1
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:25,458
- The wind is strong! - Hurry up!

2
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:28,698
Move it! Hurry up and cover everything!

3
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:30,138
You have to cover this too!

4
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:31,768
- Hurry up! - Get that too!

5
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:33,938
- Man, come on. - Hurry up and move it!

6
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,831
Did we just go through a tunnel?

7
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,101
I apologize. This was the fastest route.

8
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,710
What?

9
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,940
I had to take the highway to get there in time.

10
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,581
- Let's take the national highway. - Yes.

11
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:27,020
(Take 1 pill if necessary)

12
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,690
(Episode 1)

13
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:12,432
This week's process hasn't met the expected construction rate.

14
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:20,381
Well, it rained on and off, then on and off again and again.

15
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:21,841
That's the reason.

16
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:23,011
There's something called the weather forecast.

17
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:26,011
Don't we consider such situations when we calculate the expected rate?

18
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:30,522
Well, the weather forecast is more often wrong than right.

19
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,462
We had to pull out whenever we were about to gain momentum...

20
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:34,821
because it'd start to rain.

21
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:36,161
It's not like it rains only on this ground.

22
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:39,432
Can you meet the expected rate of construction for this week or not?

23
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,732
I'll make sure I catch up to the expected rate by next week.

24
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:45,772
I'm not asking you to overwork to meet the expectancy.

25
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:47,941
I'm asking you to make an accurate estimate of what you can do.

26
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,802
You can make an estimation.

27
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:51,811
Is it that hard to do that accurately?

28
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,642
What about securing another round of materials?

29
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:58,452
Yes, well,

30
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,682
the materials coming from China continue to get delayed.

31
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:06,452
So I've been looking for a company who can supply the materials...

32
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,221
without delay.

33
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,462
If you start looking now, can you maintain the inventory?

34
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,432
Wasei of Indonesia can ship the materials.

35
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,601
When?

36
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,232
They'll be able to load the ship within this week.

37
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:19,472
We're heading over to Building B.

38
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,172
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:24,372
Pamoro Incorporation and Bibilas of Russia...

40
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:25,842
can begin shipping immediately.

41
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:29,311
Don't just take their quotation, but check the unit cost price.

42
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:31,852
Then modify the expected rate and report back to me.

43
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,052
Yes, sir.

44
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:36,182
You should leave now to be at the meeting on time.

45
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:38,191
I can leave after I check this.

46
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:50,935
(1. Financial Statement Overview of the First Half of the Year)

47
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:52,906
(2. Report on Mid and Long-term Businesses)

48
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:57,106
Did you all look over the report from the first half of the year?

49
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:00,716
Our sales went down, and so did our business profit.

50
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,445
What about the construction cost from Turkey?

51
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:04,616
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,286
The site is near Syria's borders,

53
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:10,116
so things are a bit complicated due to the civil war going on.

54
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,426
If the overseas business isn't doing well,

55
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,255
we should focus on our domestic business.

56
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:18,895
We've just begun planning. What are you talking about?

57
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:22,166
At this rate, we'll lose our credit rating again...

58
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,466
that we worked so hard on.

59
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:26,606
Is there anything you're doing well?

60
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:36,075
I'm sorry for being late. I was at a site.

61
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:39,046
I see. Is it going well?

62
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,145
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,916
The buildings are over 20 stories, and the framework...

64
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,885
will be completed by the end of this month.

65
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:47,955
The current construction rate is 67.35 percent.

66
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,395
That's for August.

67
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,495
The ones in the parentheses are last month's.

68
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,495
He could've just explained in words. Why did he have to bring up numbers?

69
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:00,205
How's the atmosphere there?

70
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:03,645
We got rid of all services that hired illegal immigrants.

71
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:06,005
But to gain workers' trust once again,

72
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,445
I think it's best if you visited them.

73
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:17,825
They were still talking about how you treated them...

74
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:19,786
300 bowls of samgyetang this summer.

75
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,125
I believe one word from you is more effective...

76
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:25,265
than anyone else's.

77
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:28,166
All right.

78
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:31,935
Once the weather gets cooler, I should visit them.

79
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,176
Will 300 servings of sliced raw flatfish do?

80
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:38,546
If the sales for Cheonan and Jeonju...

81
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:40,515
turn out favourable by the end of this year,

82
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:43,046
we'll be able to maintain our ranking...

83
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:45,145
in the construction industry.

84
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,455
By the way, will Minister Park be present...

85
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,015
at tomorrow's charity concert?

86
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:51,926
I believe he is.

87
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:54,596
- Are you sure? - Well...

88
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,426
Last time, he might have said he was going to.

89
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,226
I'm certain. I've checked already.

90
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,736
Okay.

91
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:12,046
You should've changed your clothes.

92
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,815
You have a knack for standing out.

93
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:15,276
You're right.

94
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:16,346
Why is he so arrogant, anyway?

95
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:18,046
It's all thanks to his father that he's even relevant.

96
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:22,185
Director Park.

97
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,726
Have you still not collected...

98
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:27,526
the money from Turkey?

99
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:30,995
Why do you ask?

100
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:33,395
There is this service that I often used...

101
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:34,835
when I was in the Middle East.

102
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:36,935
Would you like me to introduce them to you?

103
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,736
They offer way better information,

104
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,135
so it'll help you grasp the situation better.

105
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:14,176
Good work.

106
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,356
I'm home.

107
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:51,205
Where? Here?

108
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,146
No, to the side.

109
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:56,546
- Oh, here? - No, not there.

110
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,615
A bit more to the side.

111
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,315
Where? Oh, here?

112
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:05,386
You've ruined Cassiopeia.

113
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,126
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,396
Da Bin, let's stop here. I'm so tired.

115
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,565
Can you put one more?

116
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:17,705
Dad's tired.

117
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,506
Come here.

118
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:27,546
Did you brush your teeth?

119
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,176
You saw me brushing my teeth.

120
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:32,685
I saw you eating some jellies after that.

121
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,715
Go brush your teeth.

122
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:43,556
Were you home?

123
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:45,865
When did you come?

124
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:48,636
I was in the bathtub, so I didn't hear you come in.

125
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:51,036
Did Professor Hwang not call you?

126
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:52,666
No. Why?

127
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:55,006
He called me, saying he wanted you to deliver...

128
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,306
a congratulatory message for some performance.

129
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:58,406
I gave him your new number.

130
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:00,306
Maybe he found someone else.

131
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:02,075
- Did you have dinner? - I did.

132
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,266
Will Da Bin be coming tomorrow too?

133
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:27,276
Yes. I already told the babysitter.

134
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:30,705
Minister Park will be there too.

135
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:34,246
I feel uncomfortable.

136
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,546
This year is going to be my last.

137
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:40,246
Why? I know you're good.

138
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:43,955
I'm slowly losing confidence.

139
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,195
Compared to the younger musicians who practice every day,

140
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,355
I feel like I'm not doing as well as they are.

141
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,926
You've been playing the violin for years now.

142
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,766
It's a waste to stop playing just because you have a kid.

143
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,465
Just think that you're practicing.

144
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,906
Also, an executive's wife performing at a concert...

145
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:04,205
is incomparable...

146
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,746
to a simple charity performance.

147
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:06,565
Da Bin!

148
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:10,746
- Mom... - Let me see. Did you get hurt?

149
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:13,176
Don't cry. I'll blow on it.

150
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:26,685
It's all done.

151
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,095
If you do that again, I will scold you.

152
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:33,325
Then can I ask Dad to do it?

153
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,365
Okay.

154
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:45,676
Thank you for not whining.

155
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:49,016
I'm here.

156
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:50,475
Ms. Jung!

157
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,516
Ms. Jung!

158
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:58,955
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

159
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,556
Da Bin, you need to wash up.

160
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:03,325
- Go on, now. - Okay.

161
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,926
Ms. Kang, have this. I'll put it in the fridge.

162
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:09,195
It's hot out. Why did you bring so much?

163
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:12,136
My relative who lives in Seongju owns an oriental melon farm.

164
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:14,176
I was given only the best ones.

165
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:15,876
Thank you.

166
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:17,506
I'll be leaving first due to the rehearsal.

167
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:20,376
Da Bin and I will go there on time.

168
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:22,676
Please choose her clothes before leaving.

169
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,286
- I'll put them in her room. - Okay.

170
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:32,585
Sir, you can't drink here.

171
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:36,955
I get it. I do.

172
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,296
So bring me another bottle of soju.

173
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,496
Hurry up!

174
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:44,166
Come on! If you keep this up,

175
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,705
I'll report you to the police!

176
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,705
Do that...

177
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:51,046
and bring me a bottle.

178
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:57,276
Bye.

179
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:04,156
Sir, why are you always intimidated by her and not me?

180
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:08,225
Sir! You seem quite drunk. Should I call your wife?

181
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,796
No! I'm fine.

182
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:14,166
Hey, do you know his wife's number as well?

183
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:18,065
Go home. I'll clean up.

184
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,735
You've seen him before, right?

185
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,166
He's Director Kim Seo Jin.

186
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:53,105
- I see. - Sir.

187
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:55,235
Thank you so much for coming.

188
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:58,176
- Don't mention it. - Today, his wife...

189
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,006
will be performing on stage.

190
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:01,715
- Is that so? - Yes.

191
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:04,016
- Is it over there? - I think so.

192
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:08,656
- My wife has dreamed of becoming... - I know.

193
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:10,156
- Let's find Dad. - Okay.

194
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,825
Where is Dad? Where is Dad?

195
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:13,026
- Where's Dad? - There.

196
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:15,825
- There he is. Let's go. - You have a good wife.

197
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:17,426
I bet you feel reliable.

198
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,325
Thank you for your compliment.

199
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,496
- By the way... - Dad must be busy.

200
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,506
Should we come back a little later?

201
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:27,605
Let's come back later. Dad is too busy.

202
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:30,406
Let's go. Let's go get something delicious with me.

203
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:33,146
I'm trying to play my role.

204
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:36,376
Director Kim is so modest.

205
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,685
Right.

206
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:39,715
Minister Park, when you are not busy,

207
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:42,386
I'd like to treat you at a quiet place.

208
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,026
How old is this?

209
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:47,085
That is...

210
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:01,819
- Da Bin. - My goodness. What is that?

211
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,219
- My. What's wrong? - What is that?

212
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,290
- Excuse me. - Sure.

213
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,559
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

214
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,959
It's dangerous. I will clean it up.

215
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,829
Are you okay? You must be shocked.

216
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:15,900
Come here.

217
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,349
If you're not going to behave, go home.

218
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,150
I'm going to see Mom playing the violin.

219
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,120
Then you need to stay quiet.

220
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,089
You scared everyone. Look what you've done.

221
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:46,500
Take care of her.

222
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,530
I'm on my way.

223
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,799
It's okay.

224
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,140
You were scared. It's all right.

225
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,640
Da Bin.

226
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:14,650
Da Bin.

227
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:17,850
Da Bin.

228
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,860
Da Bin.

229
00:19:57,749 --> 00:20:00,120
- Brava. - Brava.

230
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,789
- Brava. - Thank you.

231
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,259
Brava.

232
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,640
Congratulations. I really enjoyed it.

233
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,009
Thank you.

234
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,120
Well done. Let's take a picture.

235
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,479
Let's take it with Da Bin.

236
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:29,019
She went to the restroom. There she is.

237
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:30,320
Well done.

238
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,620
Thank you.

239
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,560
- The minister loved it. - Really?

240
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,759
- Yes. - I'm glad.

241
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:41,600
Ms. Kang.

242
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:46,400
Da Bin has disappeared.

243
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,310
What do you mean?

244
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,340
I thought she went to the restroom, but she's gone.

245
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:00,719
I thought you were with her.

246
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,519
I thought she was going to the restroom,

247
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:05,789
so I followed her right after.

248
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:26,580
Da Bin!

249
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,009
Da Bin!

250
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,380
Where is she?

251
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,289
Da Bin. Kim Da Bin!

252
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:43,529
Da Bin! Da Bin!

253
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,929
Da Bin!

254
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,009
- Da Bin. - Da Bin.

255
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,580
- Da Bin! - Isn't she in the restroom?

256
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,449
Da Bin!

257
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,340
I'm home.

258
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,380
I'm hungry.

259
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,449
- Mom. I'm home. - My daughter. You're home.

260
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:40,120
- You didn't have dinner, did you? - No.

261
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,420
It smells so good.

262
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,850
Mom's food is incredible.

263
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,860
People will think you're her daughter.

264
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,959
What's wrong with that?

265
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,989
- She's also my daughter. - Right.

266
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:54,199
It's the same stir-fried anchovies,

267
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:56,670
but yours is better than my mom's.

268
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,469
Even one piece of laver...

269
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:00,039
tastes the best in this house.

270
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,570
What are you carrying so much?

271
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,509
The stupid ones always show off.

272
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,350
Don't you know that every little helps?

273
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,709
If I add all the time when there's no customer,

274
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,179
when I'm on the subway or bus,

275
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:15,620
or when I'm waiting for cup noodle to be cooked...

276
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,320
That's still a little.

277
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,860
- Gosh. - You're so inflexible.

278
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,890
Don't blame my daughter.

279
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,999
It's all her mom's fault.

280
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,229
- Mom. - Mom.

281
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,670
Come here and eat.

282
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,570
There's nothing I can do for you except for cooking.

283
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,239
- Yes! - Hurry up.

284
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:35,340
Koreans need rice.

285
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:39,779
- Can I eat first? - Wait for us.

286
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,810
- It's radish soup. - Sit down.

287
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,590
It looks delicious.

288
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,120
- Thank you. - Thank you.

289
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,489
Yes. Enjoy.

290
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,060
It looks delicious.

291
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:05,469
It's good.

292
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:07,469
- Mom. - Yes?

293
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:08,539
When I...

294
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,070
get a job,

295
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,449
I'll buy you a dishwasher and an induction stove.

296
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:17,650
Don't. There's no room anyway.

297
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,550
Fine. Let's get a house first.

298
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,689
- Then I'll live there too. - No.

299
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,390
- Why? Why would you live there? - Why not?

300
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,459
Mom.

301
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:26,820
- Okay. Let's live together. - See?

302
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,560
- I'll live with you no matter what. - No.

303
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,529
You need to buy a big house.

304
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,630
Yes. Okay.

305
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,340
Yes.

306
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,150
(Human rights, fairness, kindness)

307
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:00,890
Hey. Don't wash your laundry in the restroom.

308
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,429
You should know better.

309
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,660
I haven't been home. What am I supposed to do, then?

310
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,830
Or you can always buy us a washing machine.

311
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,999
- By the way, are they not leaving? - It's already been a few hours.

312
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:12,999
He's coming.

313
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,340
May I have a word with you?

314
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,080
What in the world is going on?

315
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:29,150
We've been moving by the manual.

316
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,390
By the manual?

317
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,120
What have you done until we're way past...

318
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,590
the critical time to find a missing kid?

319
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:36,660
Would you have just sat around if this was your kid?

320
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,160
Please calm down.

321
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:42,330
We're looking through the venue and security footages around the area.

322
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,400
We're doing our best.

323
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,539
Then there should be some kind of progress!

324
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,340
Please calm down, sir.

325
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,949
Please take this.

326
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:00,249
- What are you doing? - You can keep this.

327
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:02,120
You know you can't do this.

328
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,090
Mr. Seo, what are you doing?

329
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,800
Mr. Kim, I'll have another talk with him.

330
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:16,529
You should go home with Ms. Kang and get some rest.

331
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,880
May I have a word with you?

332
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,650
Honey, you should go home.

333
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
What did he say?

334
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,410
Did he take it?

335
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,439
Will he make a move now that he took it?

336
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:58,779
He won't take it.

337
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,850
He'll deploy more men to look for a witness in the area.

338
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:06,120
He said they'll find something and asked you to wait a bit longer.

339
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,590
- I can't wait any longer. - Sir.

340
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:18,259
- You're here. - Hey, Ae Ri.

341
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:22,100
Go finish doing what you were doing.

342
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:26,570
- Aren't you getting to work? - It's our day off.

343
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,769
Ae Ri, is that your boyfriend?

344
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,059
My debtor.

345
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:38,854
Hey, you can eat this.

346
00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:40,584
I don't eat food that's expired.

347
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:43,223
You won't die.

348
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:46,994
The least you can do is giving me some real food.

349
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:48,564
Life is still too good for you, isn't it?

350
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:51,223
You won't find a creditor who's nicer than me.

351
00:27:51,223 --> 00:27:53,764
Hey, make sure you calculate the numbers correctly.

352
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:57,203
I'll give you a bit more than the minimum wage.

353
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:03,344
There's a customer. Throw that out for me.

354
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:18,994
Young girl, what are you looking for?

355
00:28:19,854 --> 00:28:21,354
Do you have ice cream?

356
00:28:21,794 --> 00:28:22,963
Ice cream?

357
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:25,764
Ice cream is in the freezer right outside.

358
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:29,004
Anyway, did you come here by yourself?

359
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,413
Is she gone?

360
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:44,883
Look at that little girl...

361
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:47,514
holding a stuffed animal that's as cute as her.

362
00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:54,324
Yes, hello?

363
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:58,193
Yes, I am Ms. Kwak Song Ja's guardian.

364
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,494
There's a heart donor who has the same blood type...

365
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:02,963
and is compatible with her.

366
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:06,004
She'll need additional examination. Can she come to the hospital today?

367
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:08,373
Yes.

368
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,673
Geon Wook! Im Geon Wook!

369
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:16,213
Can you look after the store?

370
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:17,514
All of a sudden?

371
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:18,854
My mom...

372
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:22,183
finally found a heart donor.

373
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:25,923
Really?

374
00:29:27,824 --> 00:29:30,463
Do you have enough money?

375
00:29:30,524 --> 00:29:31,734
What are you talking about?

376
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:34,594
If I don't have enough money, I'll sell my organs to make it.

377
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:37,463
Anyway, I'll pay you for this later.

378
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:39,274
Just take it off from my debt!

379
00:29:44,703 --> 00:29:46,443
It looks like she has no idea today is her birthday.

380
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:50,143
What a great birthday gift.

381
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:56,854
(Seomyeong University Hospital)

382
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:06,234
Am I really compatible with the donor?

383
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:09,534
What if we get our hopes up only to be let down?

384
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:12,673
Ms. Kwak, you've been waiting for a long time.

385
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:15,744
Mom, after the surgery,

386
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:18,473
do you want to travel to Jeju Island?

387
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:21,344
Goodness, we can't go to Jeju Island.

388
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:24,143
You'll use up the money you worked hard to save...

389
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,383
paying for this surgery.

390
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:29,084
I can always make more money.

391
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:32,354
You need to stop worrying on a great day like this.

392
00:30:32,354 --> 00:30:33,554
How can I stop...

393
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:42,403
Mom, you haven't gotten over your cold?

394
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:46,774
It's almost gone. Don't worry about me.

395

(CT Room)

396
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:04,584
There's the cost for surgery, the monthly hospital fee,

397
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:06,994
and the cost for medicine.

398
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,423
Then in a year...

399
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:13,794
If I throw in our living costs and rent...

404

Get ready for intubation.

405

Intubating.

406
00:32:23,764 --> 00:32:24,863
The AED is here.

407
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:34,373
Charge to 200 joules.

420
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:34,420
Doctor.

421
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,520
Yes, she turned the corner.

422
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,659
Goodness, thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

423
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,630
In this condition, she can't have a heart transplant surgery.

424
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,501
But we can't postpone the donor's surgery...

425
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:53,431
until she gets better.

426
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,671
I'm sorry, but the next person on the list...

427
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:59,811
will receive the heart.

428
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:19,391
I made seaweed soup in advance because of the surgery.

429
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,001
Happy birthday, my beautiful daughter.

430
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,210
(Ae Ri's birthday)

431
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,621
Gosh, this little girl seems to love seaweed soup.

432
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,490
I'll keep making this for you until the day you get married.

433
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,561
Hey, she won't get married.

434
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:52,731
I'm not going to let her go.

435
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,960
I'll live with her until the day I die.

436
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,201
- Eat up. - Okay.

437
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,770
Have some more meat.

438
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,861
(My Daughter)

439
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:30,800
Dad.

440
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,041
To be honest,

441
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:41,580
I can't remember what you looked like anymore.

442
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:46,650
But...

443
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,780
I still remember what you said.

444
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:54,291
That you'll never let me get married.

445
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:03,101
Dad, I don't have to get married.

446
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:07,641
So can you make just one wish come true?

447
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,541
Dad, you'll keep Mom safe, right?

448
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,180

450
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,000
My phone.

451
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:43,071

453
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,731
What happened?

454
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,270
I handed out the flyers for now.

455
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,541
Let's wait for someone to call.

456
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,080
It's almost 11 already.

457
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,080
- Did you eat dinner? - I'm fine.

458
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,620

464
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:53,206
Your call cannot be connected. You'll be redirected to voice mail.

465
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:55,875
Your call will be charged after the beep.

466
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:02,546
Hello, I'm Ms. Kwak Song Ja's guardian.

467
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:05,716
I lost my phone,

468
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,716
so if you have to call me, could you call my mom's number?

469
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:11,185
I see. One second, please.

470
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:16,656
Then I could give you a call at Ms. Kwak's number, correct?

471
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:17,766
Yes.

472
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:21,135
Whoever that picked up your phone is completely heartless.

473
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:24,036
They should give it back.

474
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,836
Hey, you should cancel the plan and get a new phone.

475
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,276
I just got that phone,

476
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:34,716
and that's my dad's number.

477
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:38,846
Should I come with you when you see your mom?

478
00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:41,586
No, she won't recognize you anyway.

479
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:44,026
You should come back when she wakes up.

480
00:39:44,086 --> 00:39:46,726
Okay. Then I'll get going.

481
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:47,755
Thanks.

482
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:00,166
Dad.

483
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:02,776
You know,

484
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,276
to be honest, right now,

485
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:09,675
I'm a bit scared.

486
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:16,586
The visiting hours will begin now.

487
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:30,396
You're here.

488
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:31,865
Hello, Doctor.

489
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,075
She's doing much better now.

490
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:36,776
- She regained her consciousness. - Really?

491
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:40,575
Ms. Kwak, your daughter is here.

492
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:43,216
- Open your eyes. - Mom.

493
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:49,086
Mom. Can you see me?

494
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:54,656
Have...

495
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:57,925
What? Can you speak slowly?

496
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:01,266
Have you eaten something?

497
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:08,776
Are you worried about me eating as soon as you wake up?

498
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:12,276
I eat well, so don't worry about me.

499
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:15,016
Mom, it'll take a toll on you. Don't say anything.

500
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:39,766
Did you find anything?

501
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:41,906
None of the information we got is useful,

502
00:41:42,106 --> 00:41:43,536
and there was nothing on the security footage.

503
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:45,646
And there's no witness.

504
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:51,585
I don't think she just got lost and went missing.

505
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:53,646
There's absolutely no trace of her.

506
00:41:55,355 --> 00:41:56,455
So?

507
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:59,256
There's a high possibility that she isn't just missing.

508
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,496
Yes, this is Kim Seo Jin.

509
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:09,965
Your daughter is fine.

Who are you?

513
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:19,776
Put my girl, put Da Bin on the phone.

514
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,475
I'll call you again.

have been apprehended.

all your incoming calls.

521
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:51,575
It's best if you can have him on the phone for a long time.

522
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:54,715
If he asks for favours, say that you'll do them.

523
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,095
Will we...

524
00:43:14,496 --> 00:43:16,095
just keep waiting like this?

525
00:43:19,906 --> 00:43:23,175
We know how you feel, but this is only the beginning.

526
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:25,705

We couldn't even celebrate your birthday properly.

531
00:43:37,725 --> 00:43:39,156
I should've bought a cake.

532
00:43:39,256 --> 00:43:42,526
Hey, we have to work three hours to buy a cake.

533
00:43:42,925 --> 00:43:44,055
Don't waste that money.

534
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:46,595
Gosh, you're such a Scrooge.

535
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:48,166
I know you're the richest one among us.

536
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:51,866
Wait. You'll be hitting the jackpot soon, right?

537
00:43:52,105 --> 00:43:53,105
Right?

538
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:55,036
Really? Why?

539
00:43:55,406 --> 00:43:57,646
- It's nothing like that. - Don't lie.

540
00:43:58,046 --> 00:44:01,116
I've known you since childhood, and you look the happiest right now.

541
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:02,845
You little...

542
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,916
Nothing is for certain.

543
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:09,215
Someone I knew told me to invest in something.

544
00:44:10,185 --> 00:44:11,185
What kind of investment?

545
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:12,685
You also borrowed money, right?

546
00:44:13,925 --> 00:44:15,256
From whom?

547
00:44:15,955 --> 00:44:17,496
What are you investing in?

548
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:21,236
If I make money, I'll pay you back right away.

549
00:44:21,796 --> 00:44:24,835
I've never rushed you to pay me back.

550
00:44:25,465 --> 00:44:26,465
I'm just worried.

551
00:44:26,536 --> 00:44:29,876
Whatever. Buy her a phone instead when you earn some money.

552
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,506
You still haven't found it?

553
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:33,445
(Missed Call: My Daughter)

554
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:36,945
- I got a call. - From whom?

555
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:38,585
- Is it that scumbag? - Yes.

556
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:40,246
Call the number back.

557
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:42,616
(My Daughter)

558
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:02,339
Hello?

559
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:05,339
Finally.

560
00:45:06,108 --> 00:45:08,579
You picked up my phone, right? Please give it back.

561
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:11,349
Who is this?

562
00:45:12,148 --> 00:45:14,549
I'm the owner of the phone you're using right now.

563
00:45:17,288 --> 00:45:19,189
- You called the wrong number. - In the afternoon of August 9,

564
00:45:19,189 --> 00:45:20,929
- it will approach Korea. - Ma'am.

565
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,488
- Could you lower the volume? - This typhoon will be fierce.

566
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:24,559
Hello?

567
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,998
I did call the right number. That's my phone.

568
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:29,199
I said, you called the wrong number.

569
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,599
If you've picked up my phone, you should give it back!

570
00:45:33,638 --> 00:45:35,169
Hello? Hello...

571
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:48,719
What did he say? Is he going to give it back?

572
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:51,158
He's feigning ignorance.

573
00:45:54,429 --> 00:45:55,488
I can't believe this.

574
00:46:02,028 --> 00:46:04,199
- You called the wrong number! - Mr. Kim Seo Jin.

575
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,479
Hello? Da Bin...

576
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:17,778
She's with you, right?

577
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:21,118
Do you want to see her?

578
00:46:22,648 --> 00:46:24,049
Let me talk to her.

579
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:26,089
I want to hear...

580
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:29,429
her voice.

581
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:31,398
Please! I beg you.

582
00:46:31,628 --> 00:46:33,959
Please let me talk to her!

583
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:35,799
I will give you all the money you want.

584
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:38,099
Please just send her back home in one piece.

585
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:41,738
- I beg you. - Please!

586
00:46:41,768 --> 00:46:44,238
She will go back home tomorrow.

587
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:45,579
Please...

588
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:48,648
Please let me talk to her...

589
00:46:48,648 --> 00:46:49,709
Did you track him down?

590
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:53,179
Had they talked a bit more, we would've pinpointed it.

591
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:55,049
We got the rough location.

592
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:57,089
Where is it? Where is that scumbag?

593
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:59,689
Please wait for additional calls.

594
00:46:59,788 --> 00:47:00,988
I'm sure he'll call again.

595
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:04,128
From here to here. Find all ex-convicts...

596
00:47:04,128 --> 00:47:05,128
in this 20km radius.

597
00:47:05,128 --> 00:47:07,028
Get me a list of those who have records...

598
00:47:07,028 --> 00:47:08,569
of kidnapping or sexual assault.

599
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:09,768
- Yes, sir. - Detective Lee.

600
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:12,538
Hand over the audio recording...

601
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,268
- to the Analysis Team. - Yes, sir.

602
00:47:14,508 --> 00:47:15,569
Da Bin...

603
00:47:15,868 --> 00:47:17,939
He didn't mention about money.

604
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:20,508
Maybe that's not what he's after.

605
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:25,949
Get me a list of names associated with Mr. Kim Seo Jin.

606
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:27,518
Yes, sir.

607
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:45,998
I already told you everything on the day of the incident,

608
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:47,868
so why did you make me come here again?

609
00:47:49,738 --> 00:47:51,038
I heard you're not working these days.

610
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:56,349
After what happened, do you think I could?

611
00:47:57,479 --> 00:48:00,518
Every time I see a girl her age, my heart sinks.

612
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:04,858
She liked me a lot.

613
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:07,559
At times, even more than her own mom.

614
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:10,329
But shouldn't you still work?

615
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:11,929
You have a lot of debt.

616
00:48:13,128 --> 00:48:14,229
Pardon?

617
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:17,628
What?

618
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:19,469
What do you take me for?

619
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:21,268
Are you suspecting me?

620
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:23,138
Not at all. Don't overreact.

621
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:25,309
It's not like that.

622
00:48:25,738 --> 00:48:27,538
Did you ever clash...

623
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:29,979
with Mr. Kim and his wife?

624
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:34,388
I wouldn't have worked there for so long if I did.

625
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:38,288
I just sympathized with Da Bin more...

626
00:48:39,118 --> 00:48:41,258
because her parents were so busy and successful.

627
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:50,469
Mr. Lee Taek Gyu?

628
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:56,209
Who are you?

629
00:48:57,439 --> 00:48:58,979
You're Mr. Kim Seo Jin's personal assistant, right?

630
00:49:00,378 --> 00:49:02,648
I have a few questions regarding Da Bin's disappearance.

631
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,679
Mr. Lee?

632
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:09,248
What is it?

633
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:13,888
I'm Seo Do Kyun.

634
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:16,589
(Seo Do Kyun, Yoojoong Constructions)

635
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:18,398
If Mr. Kim is your immediate supervisor,

636
00:49:18,398 --> 00:49:19,829
you must know a bit about him.

637
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:22,628
I may not know much about his private life,

638
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:25,439
but I can give you information regarding his work.

639
00:49:25,498 --> 00:49:27,038
I'll be straightforward.

640
00:49:27,038 --> 00:49:29,809
Is there anyone who could have a grudge against him?

641
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:33,908
He is a very competent man.

642
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:36,549
I'm not just saying this because he's my boss,

643
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:39,018
but because he's the youngest director.

644
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:42,748
He's smart and industrious.

645
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:45,758
Then many people around him must be jealous of him.

646
00:49:46,518 --> 00:49:47,618
Right?

647
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:54,799
That kind of jealousy isn't uncommon among organizations.

648
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:58,199
Being on good terms with everyone...

649
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:00,439
only exists in fairy tales, don't you think?

650
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:03,638
So it wasn't anything serious?

651
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:05,138
No.

652
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:09,608
From my understanding, there's no one...

653
00:50:09,608 --> 00:50:10,979
who'd resent him so much...

654
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:14,179
to do such a terrible thing.

655
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:20,258
- Thank you for today. - Goodbye.

656
00:50:22,758 --> 00:50:24,429
It must've been tough for you.

657
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:26,459
They say the worst kinds of bosses...

658
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:28,098
are those who are smart and industrious.

659
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:31,669
I'll call you if I have any more questions.

660
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:51,988
(Messages)

661
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,528
If you're feeling troubled, come visit us...

662
00:50:54,528 --> 00:50:55,828
at New Joy Sky Church.

663
00:50:55,828 --> 00:50:58,159
I think I've seen a similar girl. How much is the reward?

664
00:50:58,629 --> 00:51:01,229
(I still have to pay a monthly payment...)

665
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,298
I still have to pay a monthly payment,

666
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:06,038
so if you even have an ounce of conscience,

667
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:08,008
please give it back while I'm being nice.

668
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:11,238
If you don't, I'll call the police! You better brace yourself!

669
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:18,278
(Missing Child)

670
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:33,028
I was deceived.

671
00:51:33,629 --> 00:51:34,929
It was only a prank call.

672
00:51:36,098 --> 00:51:37,729
He must be a lunatic...

673
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:39,798
- to be joking around... - Honey.

674
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,538
It's not midnight yet.

675
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:47,609
We still have hope.

676
00:51:59,018 --> 00:52:01,288
Da Bin. Da Bin!

677
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:15,109
- Catch him! - Come here!

678
00:52:15,768 --> 00:52:16,838
You scumbag!

679
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:20,609
Get him! Run!

680
00:52:26,048 --> 00:52:27,518
Hey, get the car ready!

681
00:52:32,058 --> 00:52:33,558
We need to track down a bike.

682
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:45,568
(To Kim Seo Jin)

683
00:52:57,548 --> 00:53:00,619
(My Daughter)

684
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:12,028
I couldn't reach him all day, and he just had to choose this hour.

685
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:14,498
(Missing Child)

686
00:53:14,498 --> 00:53:16,429
Missing child out of nowhere?

687
00:53:17,568 --> 00:53:20,098
Name, Kim Da Bin.

688
00:53:20,098 --> 00:53:23,238
(Missing Child)

689
00:53:24,439 --> 00:53:28,379
This child looks familiar.

690
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:38,859
The teddy bear. That's right.

691
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:42,288
It's definitely her.

692
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:45,129
(To Kim Seo Jin)

693
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:52,169
Let's first open the box.

694
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,189
(Seohwi-ro 18-Gil 27 Le Cid Vincent)

695
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:51,528
No.

696
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:54,828
No. It's not Da Bin's. It's not...

697
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:58,869
I'm sure she's fine.

698
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,338
Detective Kang.

699
00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:04,939
- Detective Kang! - Yes, sir.

700
00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:07,338
- Go bring ice. - Okay.

701
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:29,159
I asked you to give my phone back, but why did you send a weird photo?

702
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:41,199
By the way, I've seen this Da Bin girl.

703
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:44,469
(My Daughter)

704
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:49,649
Sir.

705
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:53,619
We got the DNA result from the forensics.

706
00:57:02,528 --> 00:57:04,689
- Can you print a photo on a phone? - Of course.

707
00:57:04,689 --> 00:57:06,798
- Can you print this please? - Okay.

708
00:57:08,899 --> 00:57:10,229
I'm back.

709
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:12,899
No need to rush. There's no customer yet.

710
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,379
- Boss. - Yes?

711
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:22,008
Can I put this up in front?

712
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:24,848
Do you know her?

713
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:27,548
Something like that. It keeps bugging me.

714
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:30,518
Gosh, you're so nosy.

715
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:32,758
Put it up right in front.

716
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:35,729
Thank you. I love you, Boss.

717
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:37,288
Yes, I love you too.

718
00:57:56,578 --> 00:57:57,649
We just received...

719
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:01,548
the test result from the forensics.

720
00:58:01,548 --> 00:58:05,058
(DNA Test Result)

721
00:58:07,058 --> 00:58:08,359
Based on the test,

722
00:58:10,459 --> 00:58:12,498
the body part you received yesterday...

723
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:16,729
and Kim Da Bin's DNA...

724
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:20,238
match.

725
00:58:24,738 --> 00:58:27,139
Also,

726
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,209
there's what's called bioscopy.

727
00:58:30,609 --> 00:58:32,149
We checked...

728
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,748
if the wound on her finger occurred...

729
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,318
before or after she died.

730
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:44,288
There was no vital reaction.

731
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:48,369
That means...

732
00:58:52,268 --> 00:58:55,568
Da Bin is likely to be dead.

733
00:59:02,348 --> 00:59:04,709
Detective Kang. Can you talk on the phone?

734
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,619
This call is for you.

735
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:09,479
(Missing Child)

736
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:43,308
What were you doing?

737
01:00:46,048 --> 01:00:48,818
- What? - What were you doing?

738
01:00:49,848 --> 01:00:51,119
At the time,

739
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:56,129
you were next to Da Bin.

740
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:08,399
What were you doing while Da Bin disappeared?

741
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:14,008
You were next to Da Bin that day.

742
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:15,508
What are you trying to say?

743
01:01:20,419 --> 01:01:22,449
The stupid recital...

744
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:26,758
I should've been next to her.

745
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:34,798
I said I didn't want to have the recital.

746
01:01:36,328 --> 01:01:39,038
- It's all your... - Are you blaming me?

747
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:44,568
Nothing matters to you except your company's success.

748
01:01:45,508 --> 01:01:48,278
You always only think about yourself.

749
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:50,449
Da Bin...

750
01:01:52,078 --> 01:01:54,119
I miss Da Bin.

751
01:02:02,288 --> 01:02:03,659
Because of you,

752
01:02:06,058 --> 01:02:07,528
I lost Da Bin.

753
01:02:14,538 --> 01:02:15,738
Say that again.

754
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:19,078
Say that again!

755
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:43,098
Sir, I have no words to say.

756
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:49,508
Are you feeling better, ma'am?

757
01:02:49,768 --> 01:02:51,008
We're behind on work, aren't we?

758
01:02:56,479 --> 01:02:58,008
I was going to stop by work soon.

759
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,078
It's okay. You can look at that later.

760
01:03:00,078 --> 01:03:03,348
No. I'll go to work and take a look at this.

761
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:05,258
But...

762
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:31,308
Sir.

763
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:35,119
How about you officially take some time off and rest?

764
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:37,949
I'll take care of it.

765
01:03:39,488 --> 01:03:40,588
Go get back to work.

766
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:44,629
Yes, sir.

767
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:51,469
Ms. Kang, I'm here to check your blood pressure.

768
01:03:56,439 --> 01:03:57,568
Ms. Kang.

769
01:04:18,758 --> 01:04:20,959
- Hello? - Mr. Kim.

770
01:04:21,328 --> 01:04:23,169
Your wife disappeared.

771
01:04:23,498 --> 01:04:24,699
Can you reach her?

772
01:04:25,998 --> 01:04:27,038
What do you mean?

773
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:29,469
I'll call her.

774
01:04:33,879 --> 01:04:36,709
(You have a new voicemail.)

775
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,659
First voicemail.

776
01:04:47,288 --> 01:04:48,689
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

777
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:08,379
It's not your fault.

778
01:05:14,149 --> 01:05:15,419
It's just me.

779
01:05:16,748 --> 01:05:18,988
I don't think I can continue living...

780
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:21,588
without Da Bin.

781
01:05:24,788 --> 01:05:25,929
Da Bin...

782
01:05:26,498 --> 01:05:28,399
I feel guilty for even breathing.

783
01:05:29,268 --> 01:05:32,498
I can't take this anymore.

784
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,308
I'm sorry,

785
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:39,179
honey.

786
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:59,328
Close in from the outside. Okay.

787
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:18,949
Yes, sir.

788
01:06:19,649 --> 01:06:23,119
The last location of her phone was Dongjak Bridge.

789
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:26,758
The police and the fire fighters are looking but to no avail.

790
01:06:27,058 --> 01:06:28,959
Ms. Kang was spotted on the southbound camera...

791
01:06:28,959 --> 01:06:29,988
on the Dongjak Bridge.

792
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:31,959
I'm certain that she jumped from here.

793
01:06:32,098 --> 01:06:36,098
The current is really strong. She could be in Gimpo by now.

794
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:45,209
My men are near the downstream, so let's search all night.

795
01:06:45,238 --> 01:06:49,209
Yes, sir. We'll move too then. I see. Yes, sir.

796
01:06:53,518 --> 01:06:55,719
Mr. Kim! Stop right there!

797
01:06:57,149 --> 01:06:58,288
Stop him!

798
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:03,788
- Sir. - Mr. Kim!

799
01:07:05,558 --> 01:07:07,798
Let me go! I said, let go!

800
01:07:11,229 --> 01:07:13,699
Mr. Kim! Pull yourself together!

801
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:17,808
Are you trying to kill yourself? You could die alongside them!

802
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,778
No one's dead.

803
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:24,209
Both my wife and daughter aren't dead.

804
01:07:24,548 --> 01:07:25,948
She would never do that.

805
01:07:27,479 --> 01:07:28,948
Honey...

806
01:09:21,498 --> 01:09:24,268
I asked you to give my phone back, but why did you send a weird photo?

807
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:35,279
By the way, I've seen this Da Bin girl.

808
01:09:54,259 --> 01:09:56,198
After six years of construction,

809
01:09:56,198 --> 01:09:59,138
Deokpung-daero, the Sea Route of Our Dreams, is finally open.

810
01:09:59,669 --> 01:10:02,468
The construction began in 2014.

811
01:10:02,538 --> 01:10:06,279
This is the shortest route.

812
01:10:06,509 --> 01:10:08,779
It's 18km long above the water.

813
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:17,089
- Hello? - We need to meet.

814
01:10:17,989 --> 01:10:19,058
Let's meet and talk.

815
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:20,589
Are you going to give me back my phone?

816
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:24,129
If you really saw Da Bin, I'm willing to buy you 100 phones.

817
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:28,058
But if you're lying, I'm going to pay for it.

818
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,729
I have a lot to say too.

819
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:34,638
Let's meet tomorrow.

820
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,530
(Kairos)

821
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,860
I waited there for three hours.

822
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,171
How could you lie about a missing child?

823
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,141
You're the one who should stop lying!

824
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:11,070
We found the man who delivered that parcel.

825
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,141
What did you do to her?

826
01:11:13,141 --> 01:11:14,911
Is it August for you?

827
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:16,880
It's August 13, 2020, Thursday!

828
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,311
It's September here.

829
01:11:18,311 --> 01:11:19,880
You lunatic!

830
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,780
- Did you see my mom? - Ms. Kwak Song Ja was discharged.

831
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,220
Are you really from the future?

832
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,090
Please save my wife and my daughter.

833
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,950
Please save my mom!

834
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,021
It's changed. I can save them.
