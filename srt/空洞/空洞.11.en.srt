Are you awake?

3
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:23,308
How did you come here?

4
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:28,788
There's someone I need to see.

5
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,168
Are you awake?

6
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:52,238
Where is that recording?

7
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:57,607
Where's your lifeline?

8
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,217
I don't have it with me.

9
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:08,788
You don't need to complicate this.

10
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,527
Where is it?

11
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,758
Do you think I'll tell you?

12
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,368
I gave you all the money you asked for...

13
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:20,168
and let your daughter go.

14
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:22,668
You need to keep your promise.

15
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,478
You must be having trouble remembering.

16
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,508
I never said I'll give it to you.

17
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:32,017
I said I won't just sit around if you lay a finger on my daughter.

18
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:35,848
Do you think it'll make her happy if you died here?

19
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:38,657
I'm not scared of death.

20
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:41,258
I'm ready to die any minute now.

21
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:45,157
And I do not have a grain of trust in you,

22
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:47,297
who can't seem to live like a decent human.

23
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:49,368
If you want to kill me, go ahead.

24
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:52,338
That's the moment when the whole world...

25
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:54,767
will find out what you're truly like.

26
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,107
Everyone is scared of death.

27
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,848
But in this world, there are some things...

28
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:05,247
that are worse than death itself.

29
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:08,588
You aren't in great condition.

30
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:11,658
There's no need to wander here and there.

31
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:16,887
You should live in comfort until the day you die.

32
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:40,647
How much longer does she have to live?

33
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:42,887
- Pardon? - She's sick.

34
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:45,188
I heard she doesn't have long to live.

35
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,357
I'll take care of her right away on your word.

36
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:50,827
We can always take her life.

37
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:54,128
But we need to take it when her life is worth the action.

38
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:55,767

- I see. - I had a question...

60
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:53,018
as I looked over the survey we gave out at the presentation.

61
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,418
Could I meet with the residents who have negative opinions...

62
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:59,218
and find out what they have to say?

63
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:02,257
I see.

64
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:04,357

It must've been tough for all of you. Thank you.

69

You should run along and get some rest.

70

All right. Get a good rest.

Get some rest.

75
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:56,978
Mom, I need to know now.

76
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:58,478
I can't wait around any longer.

77
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:01,487
What's this thing that you're afraid of?

78
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:04,218
What have you been running away from?

79
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:08,888
I won't run away anymore.

No, I won't let it slide.

82

You know that covering this up won't solve anything.

83
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,510
Tell me everything. What is this that you're keeping from me?

84
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:23,109
Then... Then what about you?

85
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:25,879
Why did you go to Yujung Constructions' recital?

86
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,450
- That was because... - Don't tell me...

87
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,850
you were actually going to abduct that girl.

88
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,090
Not at all.

89
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:34,319
I was only trying to stop her from getting abducted.

90
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,819
You don't even know her, so how did you know...

91
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,890
that she was going to get abducted?

92
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,200
I had my reasons.

93
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,299
I'll tell you everything later.

94
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,069
Just like how you had your reasons, I have mine as well.

95
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,470
Let's stop talking about this from now on.

96
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,939
So what are your reasons?

97
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,650
Mom. Did you even consider how I must've felt?

98
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,520
Mom.

99
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:07,919
I can't allow you to disappear again.

100
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,059
Listen carefully.

101
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,169
If you want to stay with me,

102
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:21,470
don't ask me any questions.

104
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,979
I know I've done nothing for you and have only burdened you...

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,179
with my illness, but Ae Ri,

106
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,850
please respect my decisions.

107
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,350

108
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,749
I'm sorry, Ae Ri.

109
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,650
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,989
You have always been...

111
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,290
the sole reason...

112
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,559
why I strived to live.

113
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,770
So...

114
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,669
please trust me this once.

115
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,839

116
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,809
I can't explain everything to you just yet.

117
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,819
But I will protect you.

Sir.

121
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:23,620
- Yes? - The result of the EDR analysis...

122
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,959
for Kim Seo Jin's vehicle came out.

123
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:26,390
You should take a look at this.

124
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,760
What's wrong?

125
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:32,130
He had accelerated right before the crash.

126
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,230
What?

127
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:37,770
Sir.

128
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,740
The detailed blood test result for the deceased victims came out.

129
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:42,839
Let me see.

130
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,780
The NFS said that they found no toxic substances...

131
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,010
in victims Kang Hyun Chae and Kim Da Bin's blood.

132
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,150
But the detailed blood test result showed small doses...

133
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,919
of sleeping pill substances.

134
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:26,419
And the substances are similar to those taken by Kim Seo Jin.

135
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:28,890
What does this mean?

136
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,059
There's no way he would've fed them those drugs himself.

137
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,059
My name is Seo Do Kyun.

138
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,130
I got a call from Mr. Park Ho Young.

139
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,500
I see. I'll let you through.

140
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,040
What's even stranger is the EDR.

141
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,679
Look at how the vehicle moved five seconds before the crash.

142
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,419
From 5.0 seconds to 2.0 seconds before the crash,

143
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,380
the brakes weren't even used.

144
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,750
Not only did he not use the brakes,

145
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,120
but he accelerated toward the other vehicle.

146
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,360
Does this mean Kim Seo Jin caused this accident on purpose?

147
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,929
There has always been the possibility...

148
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,829
of his dozing off while driving.

149
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:13,900
But the problem is,

150
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,400
we found the same drug substances in his family members' blood.

151
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,439
What do you think about this?

152
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,809
Also, his psychiatrist said...

153
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,240
that he was delusional.

154
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,110
It was about his wife and his daughter dying.

155
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,980
Also, he sent all three of his vehicles...

156
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,419
to the repair shop...

157
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,120
and rented a car that didn't even have a dashcam for a week.

158
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:35,790
Do you think he tried to commit suicide together?

159
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,490
In that case, the other driver was also a victim, right?

160
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,490
But they ran away and left their car behind.

161
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,900
They must've been terrified since there were casualties.

162
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,630
We should hear Kim Seo Jin out.

163
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,900
But all the evidence is pointing toward one person.

164
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,040
First, let's go to the hospital.

165
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,140
His phone is at the hospital, right?

166
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,910
Probably. It wasn't at the scene of the accident.

167
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,250
First, let's find his phone.

168
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:07,620
Goodbye, sir.

169
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:12,760
Should we ask those around Kim Seo Jin...

170
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,660
about his relationship with his family?

171
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,459
I asked Mr. Seo Do Kyun to come over here.

172
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,530
I asked him to call me when he was free,

173
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,669
so he'll call soon.

174
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,260
What are you doing?

175
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,969
Mom.

176
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:55,900
What are you doing?

177
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:58,740
I'll make you breakfast today.

178
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,540
Come to think of it, I've never made you a proper meal.

179
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,010
I regretted that the most when you were gone.

180
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,660
You did prepare...

181
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,400
a grand meal for me once.

182
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,329
Really? I have?

183
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:29,770
Don't you remember?

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,910
After your dad died, I couldn't eat anything...

185
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,079
and lied in bed for days on end.

186
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,110
You were seven back then,

187
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,919
and you made me ramyeon.

188
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,189
With your tiny hands,

189
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,860
you brought a pot of ramyeon...

190
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:54,630
that had so much water.

191
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:00,500
That's when I finally realized.

192
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,010
"I need to live well."

193
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,209
"I should live a good life..."

194
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,579
"with my daughter."

195
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:13,410
Is that so?

196
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:18,620
Ae Ri, it must've been really tough.

197
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,319
Every time I had a tough time, you helped me get back on my feet.

198
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,860
I have you as well.

199
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,599
Also,

200
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,900
I called Dad from time to time.

201
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:34,230
You called him?

202
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,569
His phone number was still valid.

203
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,370
So I'd call him at times and leave voice mails.

204
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,049
I see.

205
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,010
You did that.

206
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,160
Oh, right. I visited Taejung recently...

207
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,260
and met a former coworker of Dad's.

208
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:07,669
I was so fascinated to hear stories about Dad from someone else.

209
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,140
Do you know Mr. Kim Yoo Seok by any chance?

210
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,209
Who?

211
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,679
Mr. Kim Yoo Seok.

212
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,750
Apparently, he and Dad were close.

213
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,790
I'm not sure. It's been ages,

214
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:29,160
so I can't really remember.

215
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,030
His son was also a victim of that incident.

216
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,490
Thankfully, he was rescued.

217
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,130
- But before he was rescued... - Ae Ri.

218
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,829
You're using my phone, aren't you?

219
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,469
I should get a new phone.

220
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:47,640
Okay. Let's eat quickly and go buy a phone.

221
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,679
It won't take long. Go rest.

222
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,679
Okay.

223
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,010
Mr. Seo.

224
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,386
I see you were here.

225
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:33,525
Do you have some time to spare?

226
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:36,025
We only have a few questions.

227
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:38,966
Sure.

228
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:41,665
- Look for his phone. - Got it.

229
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:54,445
His family?

230
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:58,116
Could there have been issues with his wife?

231
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:02,126
His current personal assistant is relatively new,

232
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,425
so I was wondering if you knew anything...

233
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,526
since you've been working closely with Mr. Kim.

234
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:13,195
I don't. He's one to keep his personal life to himself.

235
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:16,136
May I ask what this is about?

236
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:20,106
Is his personal life connected to this incident?

237
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:22,405
Of course not. We should head inside.

238
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,745
I thought you only needed to locate the driver of the car at fault.

239
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,215
I'm afraid things are more complicated than that.

240
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:30,386
Does this new revelation hurt Mr. Kim in any way?

241
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:35,015
We go where the investigation takes us,

242
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:37,225
so I ask for your patience.

243
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,536
I searched everywhere but couldn't find it.

244
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,005
- Are you sure? - Yes.

245
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:55,905
Ask the Telecom company for assistance...

246
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,306
and obtain his call log.

247
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,915
Sure.

248
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:09,126
Mr. Kim, do you recognize me?

249
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,356
Mr. Park.

250
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:16,126
Things could've been worse.

251
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:20,096
Did you hear the news regarding your wife and child?

252
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:28,636
Mr. Kim, do you remember how the accident happened?

253
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:38,586
No, I don't.

254
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:44,126
It all happened so fast.

255
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,725
I don't recall.

256
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:50,526
Mr. Kim,

257
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:53,735
did you take anti-anxiety medication before driving?

258
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:55,735
We are aware of your medical history.

259
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,235
No.

260
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:03,776
I didn't since I had to drive.

261
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,485
A blood test revealed...

262
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,015
a high dosage of it in your blood.

263
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:14,886
The same medication was found...

264
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:17,225
in your wife and daughter too.

265
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:19,626
What are you saying?

266
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,856
We need you to explain what happened.

267
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:23,665
Was it perhaps...

268
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,836
a suicide pact?

269
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,036
That's insane.

270
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:41,046
You'll be officially investigated once you regain your strength.

271
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:43,146
Hire a lawyer if you need one.

272
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,435
Hello, I'm Kim Seo Jin at Yujung Constructions.

273
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:10,376
I got your number from the Fair Trade Commission.

274
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:14,245
Didn't you work for its construction division in 2001?

275
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,646
So?

276
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:17,816
I was hoping to ask you something.

277
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,015
It happened a while back,

278
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:23,255
but the Taejung Town collapse that happened 19 years ago...

279
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,356
I have nothing to say.

280
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:35,566
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

281
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:52,985
The other road seems better,

282
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,725
so that's where it'll happen.

283
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,955
On October 9, we'll take a family trip.

284
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,026
I'll be in charge of planning.

285
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:04,495
Which vacation spot could that road take us to?

286
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,965
I found Han Ae Ri's mom.

287
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:10,836
- When? - Yesterday.

288
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:14,036
Where is that woman right now?

289
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,475
At home.

290
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:20,646
Did you find it?

291
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:26,816
- Find what? - I see you didn't.

292
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,786
That's why you let her go so easily.

293
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:35,796
Chairman Yu must be deeply frustrated.

294
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:43,165
(32 Jongil-ro)

295
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,136
Visit this address first.

296
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,836
The one living there...

297
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:51,146
hates Yujung Constructions just as passionately.

298
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:56,685
(30 Jongil-ro, Seojung-Gu, Taejung-Si)

299
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:58,015
(30 Jongil-ro)

300
00:21:58,386 --> 00:21:59,556
Excuse me.

301
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,356
Who is it?

302
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:03,786
The one who called earlier, sir.

303
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,806
Darn it!

304
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:21,376
The goalkeeper made a great save,

305
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:23,245
but that was a sharp cross.

306
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:25,245
Son Heung Min gets ready for the corner kick.

307
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:27,646
I'm Seo Do Kyun from Yujung Constructions.

308
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:32,556
I wanted to hear your opinion on the Taejung Town project.

309
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,816
(HJ Savings Bank Kim Ha Neul)

310
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:37,526
They just won't give me a break.

311
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,056
Why would my opinion matter...

312
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:42,465
when you're only going to do what you want?

313
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,425
Your opinion means a lot, sir.

314
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,536
We're ready to hear whatever it is you have to say.

315
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:51,536
How about a big compensation then?

316
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:52,935
Could you make that happen?

317
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,536
That's all I want anyway.

318
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,276
Shoot!

319
00:22:57,945 --> 00:22:59,276
Darn it.

320
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:08,116
Tell me if there are any changes to Kwak Song Ja's life.

321
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:29,975
Kang Hyun Chae just left the car.

322
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,846
I told her I found Kwak Song Ja, and she asked if I had the package.

323
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,715
She doesn't seem to be in possession of the package.

324
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:39,415
Let her be for now.

325
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:41,886
Yes, sir.

326
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,096
She's in way over her head.

327
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,215
You're here.

328
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:11,116
You didn't drive, right?

329
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,586
No, I took a cab.

330
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:16,755
Did something good happen today?

331
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:21,725
I met someone just like Kim Jin Ho at Taejung-Si.

332
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:23,826
There will be no hiccups now.

333
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:25,965
Our plan will work.

334
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,265
We'll leave as soon as we get rid of Kim Seo Jin.

335
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,745
Is he a victim of the Taejung Town incident?

336
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:40,346
Was he protesting with others at the New Town project presentation?

337
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:43,386
He's one of the people who are most against the project.

338
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,586
The collapse of Taejung Town though...

339
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:52,155
Do you know anything about it?

340
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,126
It was all dealt with 19 years ago.

341
00:24:57,165 --> 00:25:00,136
Why? Do you have questions about it?

342
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:04,735
No, I just find it odd, that's all.

343
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:09,505
Banyoung Constructions also worked on the project.

344
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:16,316
That company went under following the accident,

345
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:19,116
but Yujung Constructions only grew bigger.

346
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,225
Chairman Yu is quite a talented businessman.

347
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:28,695
Right, of course.

348
00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:23,985
(Come out to the west gate parking lot now.)

349
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:38,643
Excuse me, Detective.

350
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:41,083
Could you give me a hand?

351
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:44,784
The garbage disposal room suddenly won't open.

352
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:45,794
Where is it?

353
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:47,024
It's over there.

354
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:50,363
Something must be stuck. The door won't even budge.

355
00:26:51,863 --> 00:26:53,064
Let me take a look.

356
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:06,113
I couldn't get it to open for a while.

357
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,024
This was stuck on the door.

358
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:21,153
I see.

359
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:22,994
Thank you so much.

360
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:38,903
Kim Seo Jin!

361
00:27:56,264 --> 00:27:57,423
Kim Seo Jin!

362
00:28:19,554 --> 00:28:21,454
Kim Seo Jin! Stop right there!

363
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:25,893
The doors are closing. Going down.

364
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:43,304
The doors are opening.

365
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:51,784
Get in.

366
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:56,724
Mr. Seo, how did you find me?

367
00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:58,024
Just get in for now.

368
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:24,314
Now tell me. What's going on right now?

369
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:28,113
I know the police are suspicious of you.

370
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:31,224
You can stay at my place for a while...

371
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:33,254
and use this car.

372
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:37,494
I'll explain the rest when we get there.

373
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:56,183
Should we travel to a quiet place where we can be alone?

374
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,214
You need a good rest.

375
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:01,413
I'll go wherever you want to go.

376
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,623
How's your work going?

377
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:07,853
It looked like many didn't want your project at the presentation.

378
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:11,093
I understand. If I were in the same situation,

379
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:12,863
I wouldn't want Yujung anywhere near my house either.

380
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:17,163
But I thought Banyoung Constructions was at fault for that accident.

381
00:30:17,363 --> 00:30:19,573
Why are they so angry if Yujung isn't responsible?

382
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:22,534
You don't have to mind that.

383
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:24,974
Everyone is deeply hurt. That's why.

384
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:29,814
It'll take time, but I'll do this slowly and properly.

385
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:46,893
Why do you have my phone?

386
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:49,603
I thought I lost it during the accident.

387
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:53,034
I have something to tell you.

388
00:30:54,474 --> 00:30:55,833
No, before that,

389
00:30:57,903 --> 00:30:59,044
Han Ae Ri.

390
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:02,784
Do you remember Ms. Han Ae Ri?

391
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,314
For a few days after the accident,

392
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:12,554
I had a conversation with a woman named Han Ae Ri on your phone.

393
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:14,194
Then I found out...

394
00:31:15,923 --> 00:31:17,724
something unbelievable by chance.

395
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,093
What is it?

396
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:23,163
That Ms. Han, who talked to me on this phone...

397
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,464
was living a month before our time.

398
00:31:44,784 --> 00:31:47,494
Please. Please try to remember, Mr. Kim!

399
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:51,224
I know you can't believe it, but it's true.

400
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:53,964
I think something like that probably happened,

401
00:31:54,964 --> 00:31:56,304
although I don't remember anything clearly.

402
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:00,504
That's why this is even more confusing.

403
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:06,413
You have to trust everything I tell you from now on.

404
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:10,343
At 10:33pm every single night, you have been talking to someone...

405
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:13,113
who lives a month before our time for a minute.

406
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:15,353
That's how you stopped...

407
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:18,153
Kim Jin Ho's plan for abduction at the concert in September.

408
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:20,823
Do you understand what this means?

409
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,494
Do you get what this means?

410
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:29,194
It means...

411
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:31,863
you can bring back Ms. Kang and Da Bin.

412
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:36,143
Mr. Kim.

413
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:39,004
Please contact Ms. Han...

414
00:32:39,514 --> 00:32:41,173
and ask her to stop that accident.

415
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:55,694
Then Mr. Seo,

416
00:32:57,694 --> 00:32:59,494
have you talked to her?

417
00:33:03,663 --> 00:33:04,704
Yes.

418
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,474
I became restless,

419
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:11,474
so I pretended to be you and contacted her.

420
00:33:13,014 --> 00:33:14,974
But she wants to talk to you.

421
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:16,073
So please,

422
00:33:17,643 --> 00:33:18,643
you must...

423
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:22,413
You must talk to her yourself.

424
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:58,473
Goodness, what's all this?

425
00:33:58,944 --> 00:34:01,514
I'm making green onion kimchi, your favourite.

426
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,753
Tell Geon Wook and Soo Jung to stop by tonight.

427
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,354
I'll give them a box each.

428
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:09,754
I get scared when you begin making side dishes.

429
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:13,194
I'm not leaving.

430
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,164
I mean it.

431
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:20,794
I'll make braised beef in soy sauce you love, and pickled veggies too.

432
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,804
Then I have to make some kimchi too.

433
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:24,673
I'll live for a long time doing that.

434
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:27,703
You have to.

435
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:29,444
Okay.

436
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:30,504
Let me help you.

437
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:32,643
Don't use your bare hands.

438
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:34,713
There are plastic gloves in the cupboard.

439
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,219
Hello?

440
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Ms. Han Ae Ri?

441
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,919
This is the Taejung Town Collapse Victims' Association.

442
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,389
I see.

443
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,090
As a way of remembering the deceased,

444
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,129
our association publishes a small, yearly brochure.

445
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,169
We need to interview the bereaved families.

446
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,139
Would you mind helping us?

447
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,840
Me?

448
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,969
I'm not sure if I can be of any help,

449
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,279
but sure. I can do it.

450
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:12,879
All right.

451
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,859
Sir.

452
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,490
I'm Kim Seo Jin from Yujung Constructions,

453
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,100
the one who called you yesterday.

454
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,629
Goodness, I told you I had nothing to say.

455
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:52,249
Did Soo Jung leave her keys?

456
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,499
It's nice to meet you.

457
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:11,670
Who are you?

458
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,069
I'm the wife of Director Kim Seo Jin from Yujung Constructions.

459
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,080
What brings you here?

460
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:21,719
Recently, we had made a big mistake...

461
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,219
after having had a misunderstanding regarding your daughter.

462
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:26,920
I came here to formally introduce myself...

463
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,090
and apologize to her.

464
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,409
Thank you.

465
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:53,050
She must be out.

466
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,279
She had business to attend to.

467
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:57,420
I see.

468
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,860
We were too sensitive back then...

469
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,830
because it was regarding our daughter.

470
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,229
It was hard to believe...

471
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:10,759
that she was immature and ignorant...

472
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:14,300
since we couldn't believe what she was saying.

473
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,469
Then I heard that you two were...

474
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:20,469
bereaved family members of the Taejung Town Collapse.

475
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,749
That's when you visited Chairman Yu yourself, right?

476
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,090
When I heard that my husband had dropped the charges...

477
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,789
due to the chairman's orders,

478
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:37,759
I was quite enraged.

479
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,499
But now, I'm glad that we can talk this out...

480
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:42,729
thanks to him.

481
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,240
Both my husband and I have learned a lot from him.

482
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,439
Please leave if you're going to spew such nonsense.

483
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,540
How dare you visit a bereaved family...

484
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,709
and side with the perpetrator?

485
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,180
Chairman Yu...

486
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,449
is the man responsible for the collapse.

487
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,280
No matter how much time has passed,

488
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,019
this fact will never change.

489
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,759
That many people lost their lives because of him.

490
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,930
I'm sorry. I've made a mistake.

491
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:23,600
I understand what you're saying,

492
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,240
so you should go now.

493
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,480
Are you sure you can allow Ms. Kwak to be free like this?

494
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:04,810
She seems very anxious.

495
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,189
Yes, sir.

496
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,030
Seo Jin's wife...

497
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:24,060
is talking too much. She's too noisy.

498
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,199
Yes, sir. I'll take care of her.

499
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,680
You haven't left?

500
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,990
You should've made a sound.

501
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,860
How long have you been sitting there?

502
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:54,060
I thought I should be quiet since this was a fishing site.

503
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,180
Why are you bringing this up now?

504
00:40:12,149 --> 00:40:13,680
Yujung Constructions...

505
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,780
is trying to start something new in Taejung.

506
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,490
But many residents were still in a lot of pain.

507
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,660
I couldn't just ignore them.

508
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,459
And...

509
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,129
I'm also a victim of that collapse.

510
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:34,069
A victim?

511
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
I was trapped in the rubble...

512
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,569
and was finally saved.

513
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:46,509
There were many issues with that project from the get-go.

514
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,319
Once you find out what kind of relationship...

515
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,879
Banyoung Constructions had with Yujung Constructions,

516
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,449
you'll be quite shocked.

517
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,160
Actually, I was reading the papers...

518
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,930
and didn't understand what happened during the bidding.

519
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,490
That's why I came here.

520
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Yujung was a small company.

521
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,870
Banyoung was 1 of the top 10 construction companies in Korea.

522
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,740
This is the prosecution. We have a search and seizure warrant.

523
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,769
(Banyoung Constructions Headquarters, 2001)

524
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:17,339
Many large construction companies worked in collusion with small ones.

525
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:19,249
Often times, they'd sell their shares...

526
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,220
and benefit from this without even starting...

527
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:23,879
the construction.

528
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,850
I was the one who exposed...

529
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,189
the illegal, fabricated contract made between the companies...

530
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,629
and reported it to the prosecution.

531
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:35,629
But wasn't Banyoung the only company that was punished...

532
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,499
for the collusion?

533
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,370
Leniency.

534
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,540
The company that reported the collusion first...

535
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,839
was exempt from being penalized. You know that, right?

536
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,379
Right before the collapse, Chairman Yu...

537
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,980
betrayed Banyoung.

538
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,050
Yu Seo Il was a man who leeches off a large company...

539
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,589
through expediency and evasion of the law.

540
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,259
After that incident, Banyoung hit rock bottom.

541
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,500
Ironically, Yu Seo Il purchased Banyoung's shares

542
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,829
for cheap, and that's how Yujung grew so much.

543
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,640
He aims to build houses for people? That's nonsense.

544
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,869
The true cause of the collapse...

545
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:24,739
is probably very different from the one reported by the media.

546
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,780
What was the true cause?

547
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,719
Those who had investigated that case will know.

548
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:35,859
I was only in charge of the contracts and the cash flow.

549
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:40,890
Do you know...

550
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:45,599
the individuals who were in charge of the investigation?

551
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And if I do?

552
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,040
What will you do?

553
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:05,819
I can't believe it.

554
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,089
I'm not so sure about that.

555
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,660
Mr. Park.

556
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,689
Hello. I'm Kim Seo Jin from Yujung Constructions,

557
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,229
the one who called.

558
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,400
- About Taejung Town... - I have nothing to say.

559
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,160
That happened ages ago.

560
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,699
- Sir... - Hey.

561
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,400
You better not come back here.

562
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,119
Do you remember your dad's face?

563
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,619
Of course.

564
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,599
Have some tea.

565
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,640
Thank you.

566
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:05,349
I don't recall seeing that photo last time.

567
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,119
One of the bereaved families gave it to us recently.

568
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,890
I have the digital file, so I can print one out for you.

569
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,189
Your mom would...

570
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,430
What happened to her? Did you find her?

571
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,729
Yes. Thankfully, she came home safe and sound.

572
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,869
That's truly a relief.

573
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:43,119
Do you know Mr. Kim Yoo Seok by any chance?

574
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,050
Apparently, he and Dad were close.

575
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,459
(December 2001)

576
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:59,930
Ms. Kwak, I need you to take this.

577
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,339
You're the only one I can trust to keep this safe.

578
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,770
What is this?

579
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,439
I can't let Tae Gil and my son die in vain.

580
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,750
The monster that Yu Seo Il is.

581
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,349
I'll unmask him for the world to see.

582
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,589
- What on earth is this? - Don't look.

583
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:25,630
Don't look inside and just keep it safe for me.

584
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,560
You must not give this to anyone. I'll come back for it soon.

585
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,670
What exactly is this?

586
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,699
The collapse of Taejung Town...

587
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,469
wasn't a mere accident.

588
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:44,079
I have proof that'll prove Yu Seo Il as a murderer.

589
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:52,750
Ae Ri must never know.

590
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,290
Never.

591
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,089
My Ae Ri...

592
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:01,800
must never get tangled up with Yujung Constructions.

593
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:29,060
Thank you for today's interview.

594
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:32,359
I'm sure this photo will put a smile on your mother's face.

595
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Actually, I asked my mom about Kim Seo Jin's father,

596
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:41,939
but she says she doesn't remember him.

597
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,109
That's odd.

598
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:49,780
The day before Yoo Seok died,

599
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:52,380
he met with your mother.

600
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,449
What?

601
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:58,349
At that time,

602
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:00,719
Yoo Seok looked into everything he could...

603
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,020
so that the bereaved families would know why the building collapsed.

604
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,560
From what I remember, he...

605
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,170
Tae Gil's house... Yes, he went to see your mother.

606
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,630
It's one of the reasons...

607
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,599
why I don't believe he committed suicide.

608
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,770
I guess my mom has faint memories.

609
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,979
Anyway, I'll show her this photo.

610
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,880
It happened so long ago,

611
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,380
so I guess she could forget.

612
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,449
Or I could be remembering things differently.

613
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:21,329
Mr. Kim?

614
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,209
Mr. Kim!

615
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,349
Mr. Kim?

616
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:41,890
Mr. Kim.

617
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,020
The accident...

618
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:48,060
I remember now.

619
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,500
(155H 6436)

620
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,260
Da Bin...

621
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:41,730
Where's Lee Taek Gyu?

622
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,339
It was him. Bring him to me right away...

623
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:47,540
so that I can kill him.

624
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,639
What good will that do though?

625
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:55,250
What? You knew?

626
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,319
Were you in on this?

627
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:01,889
Then would I be here to suggest that we save your wife and Da Bin?

628
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,560
I'll tell you everything, so please let go.

629
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,770
I only knew that it was Taek Gyu...

630
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:15,540
after hearing about the other vehicle the police found.

631
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,970
Do the police know?

632
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:23,980
It doesn't seem like it.

633
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,550
I don't need them anyway.

634
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,710
I'll kill him myself.

635
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,280
What if you get caught?

636
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,149
How will you contact Ms. Han then?

637
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,119
You know where Lee Taek Gyu is, right?

638
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,460
I do.

639
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,690
I went to see him.

640
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,859
Where? Lead the way.

641
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,560
Please calm down and listen to me!

642
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:48,970
Lee Taek Gyu needs to die, not now, but a month in the past.

643
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,869
That's how we can prevent this accident!

644
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:53,740
Please...

645
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:56,879
Please call Ms. Han.

646
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,129
(Incoming call)

647
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:14,329
(Kim Seo Jin)

648
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:20,169
Hello?

649
00:53:20,169 --> 00:53:21,369
(Han Ae Ri)

650
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,240
Ms. Han, it's Kim Seo Jin.

651
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,210
Mr. Kim? Is that really you?

652
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:32,109
What happened to you?

653
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,710
There was an accident.

654
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,280
It's why I couldn't be in touch.

655
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,119
Truth be told,

656
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,460
my memory is still quite spotty.

657
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,520
Most importantly though,

658
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,389
my wife and child died in an accident.

659
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,389
I need your help, Ms. Han.

660
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,099
Was that really the truth?

661
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:56,970
Someone who wasn't you contacted me on this phone...

662
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:59,770
asking me to prevent the accident that occurs on October 9.

663
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,409
There were some issues,

664
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,109
but the accident really happened.

665
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:04,940
It was Lee Taek Gyu's doing.

666
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,250
We must stop him no matter what.

667
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,450
Tell me or Seo Do Kyun in your timeline...

668
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,780
and ask for our help.

669
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,050
But we've already been through this.

670
00:54:15,149 --> 00:54:16,859
This will change nothing.

671
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,159
We need to know why Lee Taek Gyu is looking for my mom...

672
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,429
in order to solve...

673
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,069
What is she talking about?

674
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,040
Why won't this change anything?

675
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:30,569
Mr. Seo.

676
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,510
Do you know what Ms. Han and I talked about...

677
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:35,810
through our phones?

678
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,399
This is all that I know.

679
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,200
The police gave this to me...

680
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,800
when she was taken in for attempted kidnapping.

681
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,399
(Please pick up. Someone's life is on the line.)

682
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,810
She was right.

683
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,679
Who would believe that something like that would happen...

684
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,679
if we just told them?

685
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,750
Then what can we do? That's our only choice.

686
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,119
Like she said, we need to solve the core issue.

687
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:24,819
Why did Mr. Lee do that to me?

688
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:29,659
Where is he right now?

689
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,429
- I'm home. - Hey.

690
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:37,899
It was getting too late, so we had dinner first without you.

691
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,369
Hey, she made some mean green onion kimchi.

692
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:44,409
I'm famished. I want some too.

693
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,849
Take a shower first.

694
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,020
Mom, are you sick?

695
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,919
I'm just a bit exhausted. I'm fine.

696
00:55:53,919 --> 00:55:56,260
See? You were overexerting yourself.

697
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,690
Let's go to the hospital first thing tomorrow.

698
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,089
Did you make an appointment?

699
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,530
No. I was too busy to even think about that.

700
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:05,560
What kinds of tests did you get at the previous hospital?

701
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:09,700
I should ask for your medical record tomorrow.

702
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,899
- Let me go with you. - Okay.

703
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,909
I feel uneasy about leaving you behind.

704
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,409
I'll be fine. You should go.

705
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,819
Better yet, you can go on a date while I'm home.

706
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,220
What?

707
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,149
What are you talking about?

708
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,450
She's right. You guys should go.

709
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,220
She can stay with me tomorrow.

710
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,690
Are you going to keep an eye on me?

711
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:34,960
I'm just worried you'd get sick while I'm away.

712
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,429
Go inside and rest.

713
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,260
It's okay. I'll prepare your dinner.

714
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,629
No, I can do that. I'll take out the green onion kimchi.

715
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,470
Hey, we should get going.

716
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,210
I'll see you tomorrow.

717
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,679
I'll be right by Mom's side, so don't worry about her and go.

718
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,980
Geon Wook, are you having butterflies?

719
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,119
What in the world are you talking about?

720
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:03,490
- Bye. - See you tomorrow.

721
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,159
Bye.

722
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,629
- So are you? - Come on!

723
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:54,310
Hello?

724
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,780
It's been a long time. This is Park Joo Young.

725
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,179
Director Kim Seo Jin visited me yesterday.

726
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,159
Okay.

727
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,409
This sinkhole couldn't have made the building collapse so easily.

728
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,839
And Banyoung knew about the sinkhole even before designing the building.

729
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,050
I'm sure there's more information somewhere.

730
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:38,220
It won't take that long. What's the problem?

731
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,389
- I'll sign it. - No.

732
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:41,020
Sir, you can just leave it.

733
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,889
He needs to sign it himself.

734
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,490
What is it?

735
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,190
Mr. Kim Seo Jin?

736
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:07,750
(Report on the Cause of the Taejung Town Collapse)

737
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,310
(Your parcel has been delivered to Mr. Kim Seo Jin.)

738
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,710
Ae Ri, did that man...

739
00:59:42,109 --> 00:59:43,819
visit or contact you again?

740
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:46,450
Who? Seo Do Kyun?

741
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,520
He never called or visited ever since that day.

742
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,319
You don't need to worry.

743
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,129
How could I not?

744
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,599
Promise me you'll tell me if something ever happens.

745
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:58,159
I promise.

746
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,869
Hello, I came to print out the medical record of a patient...

747
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:03,700
who was discharged on the 16th.

748
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,800
- Are you the patient? - No, I'm her family member.

749
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,240
Here you go.

750
01:00:08,669 --> 01:00:11,310
(Name: Kwak Song Ja)

751
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:13,980
(Name: Kwak Song Ja)

752
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,619
(Hwang Myung Ho)

753
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:19,220
You had already printed them out on that day. Do you need them again?

754
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:20,919
We didn't.

755
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,690
Are you sure they were Kwak Song Ja's?

756
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,419
Yes, I am.

757
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:28,889
It says here that you've already printed them out.

758
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:36,000
What time did they get printed out?

759
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,099
It says 1:25pm.

760
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,470
Is it the corridor in front of the medical record department?

761
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,139
Here.

762
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,649
Can we see where he went?

763
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,679
- Sorry? - He stole the patient's ID card...

764
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:53,149
and stole her files.

765
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,960
We want to see for ourselves before reporting to the police.

766
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,089
This is very important to us. Please help us, sir.

767
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:04,329
I'll check.

768
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,109
Can you play from here?

769
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,490
Can you zoom in?

770
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:29,690
Stop.

771
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:33,329
That man...

772
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,200
He's the chairman of Yujung Constructions.

773
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:42,530
Why was he here?

774
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,740
He's Lee Taek Gyu, my personal assistant.

775
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,609
Why was your personal assistant with Kim Jin Ho?

776
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:54,980
I met with Kim Jin Ho and found out how my dad died.

777
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,619
One of the construction companies responsible for the disaster...

778
01:01:56,619 --> 01:01:57,950
was Yujung Constructions.

779
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:58,980
Yujung Constructions.

780
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,250
Lee Taek Gyu killed my mom, didn't he?

781
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:04,690
If you want to stay with me,

782
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,129
don't ask me any questions.

783
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,329
I've finally figured it all out.

784
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,700
What?

785
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:30,609
Die!

786
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:36,950
Director Kim!

787
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:47,329
Move aside.

788
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:50,760
There's no use in any of this!

789
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,599
There's no point in killing him right now.

790
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,800
We need to kill him a month prior.

791
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,240
I don't care. We can kill him in both timelines.

792
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:23,800
I'll talk.

793
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,669
- I'll talk. - I don't care. Just die.

794
01:04:27,629 --> 01:04:28,899
It was Chairman Yu.

795
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:32,599
It was Chairman Yu.

796
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,520
Kang Hyun Chae blackmailed Chairman Yu.

797
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,790
What? Blackmail him with what?

798
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,159
Chairman Yu was looking for something...

799
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:59,129
that Han Ae Ri's mom was in possession of.

800
01:05:00,169 --> 01:05:01,270
But...

801
01:05:02,669 --> 01:05:03,839
Kang Hyun Chae...

802
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:07,240
lied about it being in her hands.

803
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:15,280
What is it? Tell me!

804
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,849
Chairman Yu was after a recording.

805
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,119
That's all I know. I swear.

806
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,159
Darn it. I swear!

807
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,669
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim!

808
01:05:37,169 --> 01:05:38,899
What is he talking about?

809
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:41,139
What's this recording?

810
01:05:53,619 --> 01:05:54,649
Darn it.

811
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,960
(62 hours ago)

812
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:15,010
(Kim Seo Jin)

813
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,480
(I was worried that there might be some kind of accident.)

814
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,579
(Kim Seo Jin)

815
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,619
This is Kim Seo Jin.

816
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,960
I was in a car accident.

817
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,589
The accident...

818
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:34,290
took my wife and child...

819
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,000
from this world.

820
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:44,940
I only gained consciousness myself...

821
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,770
a few days ago.

822
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:51,980
Not being able to reach you had me worried sick.

823
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,010
When did we last talk to each other?

824
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,250
Don't you remember?

825
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,780
It was about how the tracking device in Da Bin's teddy bear...

826
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,879
was still activated.

827
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,919
The date was October 2 for you.

828
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,190
I'm aware that Seo Do Kyun...

829
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:05,919
contacted you on my phone...

830
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:08,659
pretending to be me.

831
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,500
Who are you? Let me speak to Han Ae Ri!

832
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:12,260
Hello? Mr. Kim.

833
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,369
Ms. Han.

834
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:15,629
Is that really you?

835
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:19,970
I must know everything Seo Do Kyun knows.

836
01:07:20,839 --> 01:07:23,540
He probably knows where Lee Taek Gyu is too.

837
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:25,940
When we talk next,

838
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,909
I'll be with Seo Do Kyun...

839
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,220
and will pretend that I have no recollection of this call.

840
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,950
Do you understand what I'm saying?

841
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:40,389
Your call cannot be connected. You'll be redirected to voice mail.

842
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,889
Your call will be charged after the beep.

843
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:44,460
I have everything I need from Seo Do Kyun.

844
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:48,400
It turns out that your mom has all the answers.

845
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,139
Now, I'm headed your way.

846
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:03,250
Mr. Kim,

847
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:06,619
I think I know everything now.

848
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:10,259
I now know who made my mom...

849
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:13,929
run away in fear.

850
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,360
It's Chairman Yu Seo Il...

851
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:21,829
of Yujung Constructions.

852
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:48,259
(Police Line, Do Not Cross)

853
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:23,259
My gosh, can you believe it?

854
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,060
- Tell me about it. - How sad.

855
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:28,670
They were fine up until a few days ago.

856
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:30,869
Oh, dear.

857
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,409
Nothing seemed out of sorts yesterday.

858
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,840
- I can't believe this. - My gosh.

859
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:37,380
Is she dead?

860
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,440
- It seems that way. - She's dead?

861
01:09:42,409 --> 01:09:43,750
- Gosh. - She died?

862
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,020
Please let us through.

863
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:09,310
(Kairos)

864
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:24,320
(Kairos)

865
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,090
A plastic bag was found over her head.

866
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:30,299
Ae Ri, let's go home.

867
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:33,299
Mother!

868
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:35,670
The design was changed to a 15-story building,

869
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:36,770
but the construction was still carried out.

870
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,369
Five minutes after the first sign of collapse...

871
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:39,869
I received an anonymous tip...

872
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:41,540
regarding the collapse of Taejung Town.

873
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,570
Back off!

874
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:46,040
I'm in contact with Ms. Han living a month in the past.

875
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,409
I can bring her back to life.

876
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:51,449
Mom, listen to me carefully.

877
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,320
We can do this.

878
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:56,960
We can change it all.
